item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general nobility s primary focus is homebuyers who generally purchase their manufactured homes from retail sales centers to locate on property they own 
nobility has aggressively pursued this market through its prestige retail sales centers 
while nobility actively seeks to make wholesale sales to independent retail dealers  its presence as a competitor limits potential sales to dealers located in the same geographic areas serviced by its prestige retail sales centers 
nobility has also aggressively targeted the retirement community market  which is made up of retirees moving to florida and typically purchasing homes to be located on sites leased from park communities offering a variety of amenities 
sales are not limited by the presence of the company s prestige retail sales centers in this type of arrangement  as the retirement community sells homes only within their community 
nobility has a product line of approximately active models 
although market demand can fluctuate on a fairly short term basis  the manufacturing process is such that nobility can alter its product mix relatively quickly in response to changes in the market 
during fiscal years and  nobility s product mix was affected by the number of special edition homes marketed by prestige and by larger  more expensive multi wide homes resulting from the availability of varied types of financing at competitive rates through our affiliates 
most family buyers today purchase three  four or five bedroom manufactured homes  compared with the two bedroom home that typically appeals to the retirement buyers who reside in the manufactured housing communities 
nobility s joint venture and finance revenue sharing agreement with st mortgage corporation provides mortgage financing to retail customers who purchase nobility s manufactured homes at prestige retail sales centers 
these agreements  which originate and service loans  have given prestige more control over the financing aspect of the retail home sales process and allowed it to offer better services to its retail customers 
management believes that these agreements give prestige an additional potential for profit by providing finance products to retail customers 
in addition  management believes that prestige has more input in the design of unique finance programs for prospective homebuyers  and that the joint venture has resulted in more profitable sales at its prestige retail sales centers 
for more information about the finance revenue sharing agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in an effort to make manufactured homes more competitive with site built housing  financing packages are available to provide year financing  an interest rate reduction program  combination land manufactured home loans  and a down payment program for qualified buyers 
in december  st mortgage corporation advised the company that st mortgage corporation s parent company had decided not to provide any additional funding for loan originations at this time 
consequently  st mortgage corporation was seeking additional capital to fund their loan originations through other sources  primarily bank financing 
it is not clear at this time  if st mortgage corporation will be able to raise enough capital to fund the company s loan originations through our finance revenue sharing agreement 
prestige also maintains several other outside financing sources that provide financing to retail homebuyers for its manufactured homes and the company is in the process of developing relationships with new lenders 
in the future  nobility may explore the possibility of underwriting its own mortgage loans for non st mortgage loans

total net sales in fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal sales for fiscal year were adversely impacted by the reduced manufactured housing shipments in florida plus the overall decline in florida and the nation s housing market 
florida combined industry shipments of multi section homes and single section homes for fiscal year decreased approximately as compared to fiscal year and decreased approximately in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year approximately of nobility s home sales are multi section homes 
although the current overall housing market has continued to decline this year  the long term demographic trends still favor strong growth in the florida market area we serve 
management remains convinced that our specific geographic market is one of the best long term growth areas in the country and because of the strong operating leverage inherent in the company  we expect to continue out performing the industry 
with a better economy  improved sales in the existing home market  lower unemployment  continued low interest rates  the continued tight credit markets and the absence of aggressive mortgage financing of site built homes  management expects the demand for our homes to improve 
management understands that during these challenging conditions within our industry and our country  the company s strong financial condition is vital for future growth and success

the increased cost of goods sold also impacted the retail sales centers gross profit margin as they were locked into retail customer s contracts and could not pass along the increases 
fixed overhead costs associated with the lower sales volume at the manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers also reduced gross profit margins

the company reported losses from investments in these retirement community limited partnerships in the amount  although these investments will report non cash losses in the initial fill up stage  management believes that the new attractive and affordable manufactured home communities for senior citizens will be a significant growth area for florida in the future

since all allocations are to be made on a basis and the company s maximum exposure is limited to it s investment in majestic  management has concluded that the company would not absorb a majority of majestic s expected losses nor receive a majority of majestic s expected residual returns  therefore  the company is not required to consolidate majestic with the accounts of nobility homes in accordance with fin r
