item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 

table of contents rgn inhaled formulation of tb 
in october  we announced that we were seeking a strategic partner to assist in the development of rgn for the treatment of cystic fibrosis cf 
rgn is based on tb formulated to be ultimately formulated as an inhaled therapeutic agent 
we have completed a substantial amount of preclinical work necessary for an ind application  in addition to existing toxicology and pharmacokinetic data from our current clinical programs 
cf is a life threatening  hereditary disease that impairs the patient s ability to breathe due to the accumulation of mucus secretions in the airways of the lungs 
in  the predicted median age of survival for patients with cystic fibrosis was years 
there are estimated to be  cf patients in the us and  cf patients in europe 
it is therefore considered to be an orphan disease in both territories 
clinical development strategy 
we intend to engage in strategic partnerships with companies with clinical development and commercialization strengths in desired pharmaceutical therapeutic fields 
we are actively seeking partnerships with suitable infrastructure  expertise and a long term initiative in our focus disease areas 
in  regenerx entered into a strategic partnership with sigma tau group s wholly owned subsidiary  defiante farmaceutica lda  for development and marketing of rgn  and certain indications relating to rgn  in europe and certain contiguous countries 
see material agreements below 
sigma tau fully funded and co managed the phase ii trial of rgn in europe for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers discussed above 
cosmeceutical strategy 
another partnership initiative involves our peptide fragments that may be useful as active ingredients in cosmetic or cosmeceutical consumer products 
our goal is to out license these fragments for various cosmeceutical applications to companies that specialize in formulation  manufacturing  development and commercialization in this growing market segment 
manufacturing we use an outside contract manufacturer to produce bulk tb by an established and proven manufacturing process known as solid phase peptide synthesis 
we are in the process of qualifying other manufacturers 
currently  we do not have any long term supply agreements in place 
we intend to establish a long term supply arrangement with at least one of these manufacturers once practicable 
no assurance can be given  however  that such agreements will be negotiated on favorable terms  or at all 
contractors are selected on the basis of their supply capability  ability to produce a drug substance in accordance with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the fda  and ability to meet our established specifications 
we also use outside contract manufacturers to formulate bulk tb into our product candidates 
all of these formulations may require additional studies and undergo various modifications as we move through our clinical development programs 

table of contents competition we are engaged in a business that is highly competitive  and our target indications are ones with significant unmet medical needs 
the cosmetic and cosmeceutical industries are significantly increasing their interest in clinically based cosmeceutical type products and are expanding their efforts to develop new products 
consequently  there are many enterprises  both domestic and foreign  pursuing therapies and products that could compete with ours 
most of these entities have financial and human resources that are substantially greater than ours  and specifically with regard to the conduct of clinical research and development activities  clinical testing and in obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market pharmaceutical products 
a brief description of some of these competitive efforts follow rgn topical gel johnson johnson has marketed regranex for patients with diabetic foot ulcers 
other companies  such as novartis  are developing and marketing artificial skins  which could compete with rgn in the treatment of dermal wound healing 
there are other companies developing pharmaceutical products for wound healing 
moreover  dermal wound healing is a large and highly fragmented marketplace that includes therapeutic products and medical devices for treating acute and chronic dermal wounds  such as honey based ointments and low frequency cavitational ultrasound 
rgn sterile eye drops most specialty ophthalmic companies have various products on the market that could compete with rgn or be modified to compete with our product candidates 
companies may also market antibiotics and steroids to treat certain conditions within our area of focus 
rgn injectable currently  there are no approved pharmaceutical products for preventing or repairing cardiac damage resulting from a heart attack 
however  the market for a product of this type is significant  and many pharmaceutical companies and research organizations are exploring products and technologies that may prevent such damage or improve cardiac function after a heart attack 
furthermore  if we were to successfully develop rgn for other cardiovascular indications  such as acute or chronic congestive heart failure  such a product would have to compete with other drugs currently marketed by large pharmaceutical companies for such indications 
rgn inhaled cystic fibrosis is a genetic defect for which there is no cure 
however  there are mucolytic agents and antibiotic drugs on the market to relieve the symptoms posed by this disease that could compete with the potential therapeutic effects of rgn  such as genentech s pulmozyme 
cosmeceutical products the cosmetics industry is highly competitive and dependent on effective marketing and distribution 
there are multiple products currently launched by major international cosmetic enterprises that claim the same or similar benefits that may be claimed with our product candidates 

table of contents government regulation in the united states  the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern  among other things  the testing  manufacturing  labeling  storing  recordkeeping  distribution  advertising and promotion of our product candidates 
regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and foreign countries will be a significant factor in the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates and in our ongoing research and product development activities 
any product candidate we develop will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous pre clinical studies and clinical trials and other approval procedures by the fda and similar health authorities in foreign countries 
the process of obtaining these approvals and subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
pre clinical studies must ordinarily be conducted to evaluate an investigational new drug s potential efficacy by pharmacology studies and potential safety by toxicology studies 
the results of these studies  among other things  are submitted to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must be reviewed and approved by the fda before clinical trials can begin 
typically  clinical evaluation involves a three stage process 
phase i clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers to determine the safety profile and the pattern of drug absorption  distribution  metabolism and excretion  and to assess the drug s affect on the patient 
phase ii  or therapeutic exploratory  trials are conducted with somewhat larger groups of patients  who are selected by a relatively narrow criteria yielding a more homogenous population that is afflicted with the target disease  in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
phase ii trials should allow for the determination of the dose to be used in phase iii clinical trials 
phase iii  or therapeutic confirmatory  large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data for the statistical proof of safety and efficacy required by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
the primary objective of phase iii clinical trials is to show that the drug confers therapeutic benefit that outweighs any safety risks 
clinical trials must be registered with a central public database  such as clinicaltrials 
gov 
the results of all of these pre clinical studies and clinical trials  along with detailed information on manufacturing  are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application  or nda  for approval to commence commercial sales 
the fda s review of an nda requires the payment of a user fee currently in excess of million  which may be waived for the first nda submitted by a qualifying small business 
in responding to an nda  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if the fda determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
therefore  even if we complete phase iii clinical trials for our product candidates and submit an nda to the fda  there can be no assurance that the fda will grant marketing approval  or if granted  that it will be granted on a timely basis 
if the fda does approve a product candidate  it may require  among other things  post marketing testing  including potentially expensive phase iv trials  which are efficacy studies in the patient population after marketing  and surveillance to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the drug 
in addition  the fda may in some circumstances impose restrictions on the use of the drug that may be difficult and expensive to administer 
product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
among the conditions for nda approval is the requirement that the applicable clinical  pharmacovigilance  quality control and manufacturing procedures conform on an ongoing basis with current good clinical practices  good laboratory practices  good manufacturing practices  and computer information system validation standards 
before approval of an nda  the fda will perform a prelicensing inspection of select clinical sites  manufacturing facilities and the related quality control records to determine the applicant s compliance with these requirements 
to assure compliance  applicants must continue to expend time  money and effort in the area of training  production and quality control 
after approval of any product  manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the fda 
if a company fails to comply with fda regulatory requirements  fda may pursue a wide range of remedial actions 

table of contents in june  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for tb for the treatment of eb 
the fda may designate a product or products as having orphan drug status to treat a disease or condition that affects less than  individuals in the united states  or  if victims of a disease number more than  the sponsor can establish that it does not realistically anticipate its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs 
if a product candidate is designated as an orphan drug  then the sponsor is entitled to receive certain incentives to undertake the development and marketing of the product  including grants for clinical trials 
in  we received a two year grant for  from the fda s office of orphan product developments 
in  we received additional government funding of  generally  if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years in the united states 
there may be multiple designations of orphan drug status for a given drug and for different indications 
orphan drug designation does not guarantee that a product candidate will be approved by the fda for marketing for the designation  and even if a sponsor of a product candidate for an indication for use with an orphan drug designation is the first to obtain fda approval of an nda for that designation and obtains marketing exclusivity  another sponsor s application for the same drug product may be approved by the fda during the period of exclusivity if the fda concludes that the competing product is clinically superior 
in this instance  the orphan designation and marketing exclusivity originally granted would be lost in favor of the clinically superior product 
proprietary rights we have applied for or hold over worldwide patents on peptide compositions  uses and formulations related to dermal and ophthalmic indications and other organ and tissue repair activities  as well as for cosmetic and consumer product applications 
in  we entered into a license agreement with the nih under which we received an exclusive worldwide license from the nih for all claims within the scope of the nih s patent application covering the use of tb as a tissue growth and repair factor 
during  a patent issued in europe and the us related to the original nih patent application  which expires in july corresponding patents have been granted in hong kong  australia and china 
the issued european patent is being opposed by a third party at the european patent office 
in exchange for the exclusive license  we must make certain minimum royalty and milestone payments to the nih 
through december  we have complied with all minimum royalty requirements  and no milestone payments have been required under the agreement 

table of contents we hold a us patent relating to the use of tb for treatment of alopecia  an autoimmune skin disease that results in hair loss  that expires in  with corresponding patents in europe and singapore that expire in in february  we were issued a patent in china for the use of tb to treat eb  which expires in under a research agreement with the george washington university gwu  we funded tb research at gwu and received a sole and exclusive worldwide license to any resulting patents 
while we no longer fund research under this agreement  we remain obligated to pay gwu a royalty of of the net sales  if any  of specified products covered by patents issued in connection with the agreement 
pursuant to the research agreement  we have exclusive rights to patent applications filed in the united states and in europe disclosing the use of tb for the treatment of septic shock and associated syndromes  including adult respiratory distress syndrome 
two us patents covered by this agreement have been issued  which expire in and we have also filed numerous additional us and international patent applications covering various compositions  uses  formulations and other components of tb  as well as for novel peptides resulting from our research efforts 
there can be no assurance that these  or any other future patent applications under which we have rights  will result in the issuance of a patent or that any patent issued will not be subject to challenge or opposition 
in the case of a claim of patent infringement by or against us  there can be no assurance that we will be able to afford the expense of any litigation that may be necessary to enforce our proprietary rights 
material agreements licensing agreements 
as noted in proprietary rights above  we are obligated to pay royalties to the nih and gwu 
while the nih agreement calls for a minimum annual royalty of  other royalty obligations to nih  and all royalty obligations to gwu  are triggered only upon the sale or license of our technology to a third party  which has not occurred to date 
defiante farmaceutica  lda 
we have exclusively licensed certain internal and external wound healing european rights to tb to defiante farmaceutica  lda  or defiante  a portuguese company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of sigma tau  a pharmaceutical company headquartered in rome  italy and who  together with its affiliates  are our largest stockholder group 
these licensed rights to tb include its use to treat indications that are the subject of all of our current dermal clinical trials as well as the treatment of heart attacks 
the license excludes the use of tb in ophthalmic indications and other indications that are disease based and not the result of a wound 
under the agreement  defiante will develop tb for the treatment of internal and external wounds in europe and certain other contiguous and geographically relevant countries 
the license agreement expires on a country by country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire of any granted patent in the territory having at least one valid claim covering the products then on the market  the expiration of any other exclusive or proprietary marketing rights  or january under the license agreement  defiante is obligation to pay us a royalty on commercial sales  if any  and we will supply all required tb for development 
upon the completion of a phase ii clinical trial for the covered indications that yields positive results in terms of efficacy and safety  defiante must either pay us a million milestone payment or initiate and fund a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of the applicable product candidate in order to maintain the license 
as described elsewhere in this report  we have recently completed two phase ii clinical trials of rgn in the treatment of pressure ulcers and venous stasis ulcers 
however  due to the lack of statistical significance of the reported efficacy results  we cannot assure you that the reported results of these trials will be sufficient to trigger the milestone obligation described above  and there can be no assurance that we will ever receive this payment or be able to initiate a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of rgn under this provision 

table of contents the license agreement with defiante also contains future clinical and regulatory milestones in the licensed territory 
as those milestones are attained  certain performance criteria regarding commercial registration and minimum annual royalties will be payable to us in each licensed country 
the agreement does not prevent us from sublicensing the technology in countries outside the licensed territory  and has no impact on any us rights 
clinical development agreements we have entered into agreements with a outside service providers for the manufacture and development of tb  the formulation of tb into our product candidates  the conduct of pre clinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies in animal models  and the management and execution of clinical trials in humans 
terms of these agreements vary  in that they can last from a few months to more than a year in duration 
certain of these agreements require initial up front payments ranging from to of the total estimated cost 
for additional information regarding our research and development expenses over the past two years  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations in this report 
employees to balance costs and optimize control  we utilize an outsourcing business strategy  whereby our management oversees the outsourced activities for many of our research and development and administrative functions 
we currently have nine full time employees and two part time employees  and we retain several independent contractors on an as needed basis 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees 
corporate information we were incorporated in delaware in our principal executive offices are located at bethesda metro center  suite  bethesda  maryland available information our electronic filings with the us securities and exchange commission the sec including our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k  and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section a or d of the securities exchange act of  as amended are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we have electronically filed such information with  or furnished such information to  the sec 

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our liquidity and need for financing we estimate that our current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to fund our operations into early however  we will need substantial additional funds to expand operations  which we may not be able to raise on favorable terms  or at all 
in the first quarter of  we reported on several trials in our clinical program the results of a phase ii clinical trial evaluating our topical gel product candidate rgn in patients with pressure ulcers  the results of a phase ii clinical trial evaluating our topical gel product candidate rgn in patients with venous stasis ulcers  the results of a phase i clinical trial evaluating our injectable product candidate rgn in healthy volunteers  and the early termination of a phase i clinical trial evaluating our ophthalmic product candidate rgn due to data obtained under a compassionate ind indicating rgn s positive effects on corneal wound healing 
as of the date of this report  we are continuing to enroll patients in our phase ii clinical trial evaluating our topical gel product candidate rgn in patients with eb  furthering our research with our peptide fragments targeting the cosmeceutical market and actively pursuing potential licensing partnerships for our other product candidates 
as of the date of this report  we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations into early however  we will need substantial additional funds in order to initiate any further preclinical studies or clinical trials  and to fund our operations beyond early accordingly  we will have a need for financing and are in the process of exploring various alternatives  including  without limitation  a public or private placement of our securities  debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or the sale of certain of our intellectual property rights 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are variable  as opposed to fixed costs 
accordingly  we believe that we have the ability to reduce costs to offset the results of a prolonged or severe economic downturn 
management has been closely monitoring expenditures and intends to restrict such expenditures to those expenses that are necessary to complete activities related to existing clinical trials  identifying additional sources of working capital and general administrative costs in support of these activities 
we continue to actively seek new sources of working capital 
we have recently implemented a number of efforts to preserve our cash  including salary reductions for certain of our employees and reductions in non employee director fees  and we recently entered into an agreement with affiliates of sigma tau group  our largest stockholder group  to obtain an additional  in equity financing 
with our expected reduced monthly cash outflows and the additional funds raised from this financing that we expect to receive later in april  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  which were approximately million at december   will fund our operations into the first quarter of although we intend to continue to seek additional financing or a strategic partner  we may not be able to complete a financing or corporate transaction  either on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to complete a financing or strategic transaction  we may not be able to continue as a going concern after our funds have been exhausted  and we could be required to take actions that may result in stockholders having little or no continuing interest in our assets  such as ceasing operations  seeking protection under the provisions of the us bankruptcy code or liquidating and dissolving our company 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed elsewhere in these risk factors 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we are seeking to maximize the value of our assets and to address our liabilities and raise additional capital for our existing business 
we are attempting to pursue asset out licenses  asset sales  mergers or similar strategic transactions 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing a strategic transaction 
we are actively considering strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing the value of our assets 
in addition  we are considering restructuring alternatives  including business arrangements such as the out licensing or sale of product candidates or our company as a whole 
there are substantial challenges and risks which will make it difficult to successfully implement any of these opportunities before early  after which we may not be able to fund our current operations without additional financing 
even if we determine to pursue one or more of these alternatives  we may be unable to do so on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents we have incurred losses since inception and expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future and may never become profitable 
we have incurred net operating losses every year since our inception in we believe these losses will continue for the foreseeable future  and may increase  as we pursue our product development efforts related to tb as of december   our accumulated deficit totaled million and our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
we anticipate substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts and seek to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates to make them commercially viable 
our ability to generate additional revenues and to become profitable will depend largely on our ability  alone or through the efforts of third party licensees and collaborators  to efficiently and successfully complete the development of our product candidates  obtain necessary regulatory approvals for commercialization  scale up commercial quantity manufacturing capabilities either internally or through third party suppliers  and market our product candidates 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve any of these objectives or that we will ever become profitable or be able to maintain profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot predict the level of such profitability 
if we sustain losses over an extended period of time and are not otherwise able to raise necessary funds to continue our development efforts and maintain our operations  we may be forced to cease operations 
the recent downturn in the us economy and the recent pressure on capital markets increase the possibility of and may exacerbate the impact of any adverse effects on our financial position and business prospects 
continued economic adversity may lead to or accelerate a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise capital  enter into collaborations or maintain our compliance with the minimum listing standards of the nyse amex stock exchange 
the recent downturn in the us economy and the extraordinary pressure being placed on both debt and equity markets have led to significant retraction in us businesses  sudden and severe decreases in the prices of us equities generally and a severe shortage in available credit 
these factors have made it more difficult  in general  for companies to expand or maintain their current operations and have increased the likelihood that certain companies will fail 
although we cannot say with certainty the impact the current economic crises has had on us to date or may have on us in the future  continued pressure on the us economy and its capital markets may make it more difficult for us to raise capital or enter into collaborations or licensing relationships for purposes of developing our technology and or increasing our liquidity 
any inability for us to raise capital or enter into strategic relationships  as a result of the economic downturn or otherwise  would make it more difficult or impossible for us to continue operations after the end of or early the economic downturn may also lead to or accelerate a decrease in the trading price of our common stock  which could make it more difficult for us to maintain compliance with certain continued listing requirements of the nyse amex exchange  including a market capitalization of at least million  as described below 

table of contents if we are unable to successfully implement our cash preservation efforts  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we incurred a net loss of approximately million for in light of our current cash position  we have taken  and we plan to undertake  a number of actions intended to preserve our cash balances in in april  we initiated activities to reduce monthly cash outflows  including salary reductions for certain of our employees  reductions in general and administrative expenses and reductions in non employee director fees 
if these reductions are not effectively managed  or if our management and key employees do not continue with us  we may experience unanticipated effects from these reductions causing harm to our business and our relationships with third parties 
we are currently not in compliance with nyse amex rules regarding the minimum shareholders equity requirement and are at risk of being delisted from the nyse amex stock exchange  which may subject us to the sec s penny stock rules and decrease the liquidity of our common stock 
if our common stock is delisted  this would likely make capital raising efforts more difficult 
because of our historical losses from operations  nyse amex rules require that we maintain a minimum shareholders equity of million  unless our market capitalization exceeds million 
as of december   our total stockholders equity was million  and subsequently  our market capitalization has fallen below million 
while we have not received a formal deficiency letter from nyse amex  we may be deemed to be out of compliance with nyse amex listing rules 
in the event that we were to receive a formal deficiency notice  we would be required to issue a press release and to file the appropriate report with the sec 
we would then expect to have an opportunity to regain compliance within a specified period of time or to provide the exchange with a plan to regain compliance with the appropriate listing standard or  if the exchange does not accept such a plan  appeal any decision by the exchange to delist our shares 
there can be no assurance that the exchange would accept such a plan  that such a plan would be successful  or that any appeals by us to the exchange would be successful 
if at the conclusion of compliance periods described above  we have not achieved compliance  we expect that our common stock would be delisted from the nyse amex exchange 
following any such delisting  our common stock may be traded over the counter on the otc bulletin board or in the pink sheets 
these alternative markets  however  are generally considered to be less efficient than  and not as broad as  the nyse amex exchange 
many otc bulletin board and pink sheets stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on the nyse amex  which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock 
if our common stock is delisted from nyse amex  there may be a limited market for our stock  trading in our stock may become more difficult and our share price could decrease even further 
specifically  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for such shares or at all 
in addition  if our common stock is delisted  our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired because of the less liquid nature of the otc bulletin board and the pink sheets 
while we cannot guarantee that we would be able to complete an equity financing on acceptable terms  or at all  we believe that dilution from any equity financing while our shares are quoted on the otc bulletin board or the pink sheets would likely be substantially greater than if we were to complete the financing while our common stock is traded on the nyse amex exchange 
in the event our common stock is delisted  it may also become subject to penny stock rules 
the sec generally defines penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
we are not currently subject to the penny stock rules because our common stock qualifies for an exception to the sec s penny stock rules for companies that have an equity security that is quoted on an exchange 
however  if we were delisted  our common stock would become subject to the penny stock rules  which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our common stock 
if our common stock were considered penny stock  the ability of broker dealers to sell our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the secondary market would be limited and  as a result  the market liquidity for our common stock may be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that trading in our securities will not be subject to these or other regulations in the future 

table of contents in addition to our current operational requirements  we will need substantial additional capital to develop our product candidates and for our future operations 
if we are unable to obtain such funds when needed  we may have to delay  scale back or terminate our product development efforts or our business 
beyond our current liquidity needs  we anticipate that substantial new capital resources will be required to continue our independent product development efforts  including any and all follow on trials that will result from our current clinical programs  and to scale up manufacturing processes for our product candidates 
the actual amount of funds that we will need will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  without limitation the scope of our clinical trials  which is significantly influenced by the quality of clinical data achieved as trials are completed and the requirements established by regulatory authorities  the speed with which we complete our clinical trials  which depends on our ability to attract and enroll qualifying patients and the quality of the work performed by our clinical investigators  the time required to prosecute  enforce and defend our intellectual property rights  which depends on evolving legal regimes and infringement claims that may arise between us and third parties  the ability to manufacture at scales sufficient to supply commercial quantities of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval  which may require levels of effort not currently anticipated  and the successful commercialization of our product candidates  which will depend on our ability to either create or partner with an effective commercialization organization and which could be delayed or prevented by the emergence of equal or more effective therapies 
potential sources of outside capital include entering into strategic business relationships  public or private sales of shares of our capital stock  or the issuance of debt  or other similar financial instruments 
we do not have any committed sources of outside capital at this time beyond a commitment from affiliates of sigma tau group to purchase  in shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in the near term 
even with this additional  in funding  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain further capital in sufficient amounts  or on acceptable terms  or in the timeframe needed to ensure the uninterrupted execution of our business strategy 

table of contents emerging biotechnology companies like us may raise capital by licensing intellectual property rights to other biotechnology or pharmaceutical enterprises 
we intend to pursue this strategy  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to license our intellectual property or product development programs on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are successful in raising additional capital through such a license  we may have to give up valuable short and or long term rights to our intellectual property 
in addition  the business priorities of the strategic partner may change over time  which creates the possibility that the interests of the strategic partner in developing our technology may diminish  which could have a potentially material negative impact on the value of our interest in the licensed intellectual property or product candidates 
in addition  if we raise funds by selling shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be significantly diluted 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of preferred stock or debt securities  these securities are likely to have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock and may involve significant fees  interest expense  restrictive covenants or the granting of security interests in our assets 
our failure to successfully address ongoing liquidity requirements would have a material negative impact on our business  including the possibility of surrendering our rights to some technologies or product opportunities  delaying our clinical trials  or ceasing our operations 
risks related to our business and operations our business prospects are difficult to evaluate because we are developing complex and novel medical product candidates 
since our product candidates rely on complex technologies  it may be difficult for you to assess our growth  licensing and earnings potential 
it is likely we will face many of the difficulties that companies developing new biological or pharmaceutical technologies often face 
these include  among others limited financial resources  developing novel  commercial grade drug substances  testing and evaluating a new chemical entity and its effects in highly complex biological systems  marketing new products for which a market is not yet established and may never become established  challenges related to the approval and acceptance of drug candidates by united states federal and international regulatory authorities  delays inherent in the execution of clinical trials  high product development costs that result from all of these factors  competition from other therapies and drug candidates promoted by entities with significantly more capital resources and marketing expertise than us  and difficulty recruiting qualified employees for management and other positions 
we will likely face these and other difficulties in the future  some of which may be beyond our control 
if we are unable to successfully address these difficulties as they arise  our future results of operations and business prospects will be negatively affected 
we cannot be certain that our product candidates will prove safe and efficacious  that our business strategies will be successful or that we will successfully address any and all problems that may arise 

table of contents we may not successfully establish and maintain development and testing relationships with third party service providers and collaborators  which could adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates 
we have only limited resources  experience with and capacity to conduct requisite testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates 
as a result  we rely and expect to continue to rely on third party service providers and collaborators  including corporate partners  licensors and contract research organizations  or cros  to perform a number of activities relating to the development of our drug candidates  including the design and conduct of clinical trials  and potentially the obtaining of regulatory approvals 
for example  we currently rely on several third party contractors to manufacture and formulate tb into the product candidates used in our clinical trials  develop assays to assess tb s effectiveness in complex biological systems  recruit clinical investigators and sites to participate in our trials  manage the clinical trial process and collect  evaluate and report clinical results 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our current arrangements with these third parties or maintain such relationships on favorable terms 
our agreements with these third parties may also contain provisions that restrict our ability to develop and test our product candidates or that give third parties rights to control aspects of our product development and clinical programs 
in addition  conflicts may arise with our collaborators  such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of clinical data  the achievement of milestones  the interpretation of financial provisions or the ownership of intellectual property developed during the collaboration 
if any conflicts arise with our existing or future collaborators  they may act in their self interest  which may be adverse to our best interests 
any failure to maintain our collaborative agreements and any conflicts with our collaborators could delay or prevent us from developing our product candidates 
we and our collaborators may fail to develop products covered by our present and future collaborations if  among other things we do not achieve our objectives under our collaboration agreements  we or our collaborators are unable to obtain patent protection for the products or proprietary technologies we develop in our collaborations  we are unable to manage multiple simultaneous product development collaborations  our collaborators become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors  we or our collaborators encounter regulatory hurdles that prevent commercialization of our product candidates  or we develop products and processes or enter into additional collaborations that conflict with the business objectives of our other collaborators 
we also have less control over the timing and other aspects of our clinical trials than if we conducted the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own 
third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol or applicable regulations 
we also rely on clinical research organizations to perform much of our data management and analysis 
they may not provide these services as required or in a timely manner 
if any of these parties do not meet deadlines or follow proper procedures  including procedures required by law  the pre clinical studies and clinical trials may take longer than expected  may be delayed or may be terminated  which would have a materially negative impact on our product development efforts 
if we were forced to find a replacement entity to perform any of our pre clinical studies or clinical trials  we may not be able to find a suitable entity on favorable terms or at all 
even if we were able to find a replacement  resulting delays in the tests or trials may result in significant additional expenditures and delays in obtaining regulatory approval for drug candidates  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business prospects 

table of contents we are subject to intense government regulation and we may not receive regulatory approvals for our new drug candidates 
our product candidates will require regulatory approvals prior to sale 
in particular  therapeutic agents are subject to stringent approval processes  prior to commercial marketing  by the fda and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries 
the process of obtaining fda and corresponding foreign approvals is costly and time consuming  and we cannot assure you that such approvals will be granted 
also  the regulations we are subject to change frequently and such changes could cause delays in the development of our product candidates 
in addition  the timing of clinical trials necessary for fda approval is dependent on  among other things  fda and investigational review board  or irb reviews  clinical site approvals  successful manufacturing of clinical materials  sufficient funding  eligible patient enrollment and other factors outside of our control 
there can be no assurance that our clinical trials will in fact demonstrate  to the satisfaction of the fda and others  that our product candidates are sufficiently safe or effective 
the fda or we may also restrict or suspend our clinical trials at any time if either believes that we are exposing the subjects participating in the trials to unacceptable health risks 
as a consequence  we may need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned  for reasons such as the fda or other health regulatory authorities  or irbs  do not approve a clinical trial protocol or place a clinical trial on hold  suitable patients do not enroll in a clinical trial in sufficient numbers or at the expected rate  or data is adversely affected by trial conduct or patient drop out  patients experience serious adverse events  including adverse side effects of our drug candidates  for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates  including the advanced stage of their disease and other medical problems  patients in the placebo or untreated control group exhibit greater than expected improvements or fewer than expected adverse events  third party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical trials on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices  or other third party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner  service providers  collaborators or co sponsors do not adequately perform their obligations in relation to the clinical trial or cause the trial to be delayed or terminated  regulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities  which may  among other things  require us or a co sponsor to undertake corrective action or suspend the clinical trials  the interim results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or negative  the clinical trial  although approved and completed  generates data that is not considered by the fda or others to be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy  and changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions affect the conduct of the clinical trial or the interpretation of its results 
any failure to obtain or any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals would have a material adverse impact on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates

mauro bove  a member of our board of directors  is also a director and officer of sigma tau finanziaria spa  who with its affiliated entities are collectively our largest stockholder group 
sigma tau pharmaceuticals is also our strategic partner in europe with respect to the development of certain of our drug candidates 
during  we issued shares of common stock and common stock warrants to affiliates of sigma tau in two private placement financing transactions  but we retained the right to repurchase some of these shares under certain circumstances 
in april  we signed a securities purchase agreement with affiliates of sigma tau under which these investors have agreed to purchase  of our common stock and warrants 
we have licensed certain rights to our product candidates generally for the treatment of dermal and internal wounds  to defiante farmaceutica spa  a wholly owned subsidiary of sigma tau  in europe 
under the license agreement  upon the completion of a phase ii clinical trial of either of these product candidates that yields positive results in terms of clinical efficacy and safety  defiante is obligated to either make a million milestone payment to us or to initiate and fund a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of the product candidate 
as described elsewhere in this report  we have recently completed two phase ii clinical trials of rgn in the treatment of pressure ulcers and venous stasis ulcers 
however  due to the lack of statistical significance of the reported efficacy results  we cannot assure you that the results of these trials will be sufficient to trigger the milestone obligation described above  and there can be no assurance that we will ever receive this payment or be able to initiate a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of rgn under this provision 
as a result of mr 
bove s relationship with sigma tau  there could be a conflict of interest between mr

any decision in the best interests of sigma tau may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders 
we are heavily reliant on our license from the national institutes of health for the rights to t  and any loss of these rights would adversely affect our business 
we have received an exclusive worldwide license to intellectual property discovered at the national institutes of health  or nih  pertaining to the use of t in wound healing and tissue repair 
the intellectual property rights from this license form the basis for our current commercial development focus with t this license terminates upon the last to expire of the patent applications that are filed in connection with the license 
this license requires us to pay a minimum annual royalty to the nih  regardless of the success of our product development efforts  plus certain other royalties upon the sale of products created by the intellectual property granted under the license 
we rely on this license for a significant portion of our business 
this license may be terminated for a number of reasons  including non payment of the royalty or lack of continued product development  among others 
while to date we believe that we have complied with all requirements to maintain the license  the loss of this license would have a material adverse effect on our business and business prospects and may require us to cease development of our current line of t based product candidates 
all of our drug candidates are based on a single compound that has yet to be proven effective in human subjects 
our current primary business focus is the development of tb  and its analogues  derivatives and fragments  for the treatment of non healing wounds and other conditions 
while we have in the past explored and may in the future explore the use of other compounds for the treatment of other medical conditions  we presently have no immediate plans to develop products for such purposes 
unlike many pharmaceutical companies that have a number of unique chemical entities in development  we are dependent on a single molecule  formulated for different administrations  for our potential commercial success 
as a result  any common safety or efficacy concerns for tb based products that cross formulations would have a much greater impact on our business prospects than if our product pipeline were more diversified 

table of contents our drug candidates are still in research and development  and we do not expect them to be commercially available for the foreseeable future  if at all 
only a small number of research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs 
potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
these include the possibility that the potential products may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during pre clinical studies or clinical trials  fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  or be uneconomical or otherwise fail to achieve market acceptance 
if any of these potential problems occurs  we may never successfully market tb based products 
we have no manufacturing or formulation capabilities and are dependent upon third party suppliers to provide us with our product candidates 
if these suppliers do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities  at acceptable quality levels and at acceptable cost  or if we are unable to identify suitable replacement suppliers if needed  our clinical development efforts could be delayed  prevented or impaired 
we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and have little experience in manufacturing pharmaceutical products 
we currently rely  and expect to continue to rely  primarily on one of the leading peptide manufacturers to supply us with tb for further formulation into our product candidates 
we have engaged three separate smaller drug formulation contractors for the formulation of clinical grade product candidates  one each for rgn  rgn and rgn we currently do not have an alternative source of supply for either tb or the individual drug candidates 
if these suppliers  together or individually  are not able to supply us with either tb or individual product candidates on a timely basis  in sufficient quantities  at acceptable levels of quality and at a competitive price  or if we are unable to identify a replacement manufacturer to perform these functions on acceptable terms as needed  our development programs could be seriously jeopardized 
the risks of relying solely on single suppliers for our product candidates include their respective abilities to ensure quality and compliance with regulations relating to the manufacture of pharmaceuticals  their manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient or available to produce the required quantities of our product candidates based on our planned clinical development schedule  if at all  they may not have access to the capital necessary to expand their manufacturing facilities in response to our needs  commissioning replacement suppliers would be difficult and time consuming  individual suppliers may have used substantial proprietary know how relating to the manufacture of our product candidates and  in the event we must find a replacement or supplemental supplier  our ability to transfer this know how to the new supplier could be an expensive and or time consuming process  an individual supplier may experience events  such as a fire or natural disaster  that force it to stop or curtail production for an extended period  an individual supplier could encounter significant increases in labor  capital or other costs that would make it difficult for them to produce our products cost effectively  or an individual supplier may not be able to obtain the raw materials or validated drug containers in sufficient quantities  at acceptable costs or in sufficient time to complete the manufacture  formulation and delivery of our product candidates 

table of contents if any of our key employees discontinue their services with us  our efforts to develop our business may be delayed 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management team 
the loss of our chairman and chief scientific advisor  allan goldstein  or our chief executive officer  jj finkelstein  could prevent or significantly delay the achievement of our goals 
we have employment agreements with dr 
goldstein and mr 
finkelstein 
as described elsewhere in this report  we have recently initiated salary reductions for our employees  including dr 
goldstein and mr 
finkelstein 
however  we cannot assure you that such agreements would prevent them from terminating their employment with or without good reason  and they  or other key employees  may elect to terminate their employment as a result of recent salary reductions or for other reasons 
in addition  we do not maintain a key man life insurance policy with respect to dr 
goldstein or mr 
finkelstein 
in the future  we anticipate that we may need to add additional management and other personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense  and our success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to attract or retain such personnel will be successful 
we are subject to intense competition from companies with greater resources and more mature products  which may result in our competitors developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do 
we are engaged in a business that is highly competitive 
research and development activities for the development of drugs to treat indications within our focus are being sponsored or conducted by private and public research institutions and by major pharmaceutical companies located in the united states and a number of foreign countries 
most of these companies and institutions have financial and human resources that are substantially greater than our own  and they have extensive experience in conducting research and development activities and clinical trials and in obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market pharmaceutical products that we do not have 
as a result  they may develop competing products more rapidly that are safer  more effective  or have fewer side effects  or are less expensive  or they may develop and commercialize products that render our product candidates non competitive or obsolete 
with respect to wound healing  johnson johnson is marketing regranex for this purpose in patients with diabetic foot ulcers 
other companies  such as novartis  are developing and marketing artificial skins  which could compete with our product candidates in certain wound healing areas 
moreover  wound healing is a large and highly fragmented marketplace attracting many companies  large and small  to develop products for treating acute and chronic wounds  including  for example  honey based ointments and low frequency cavitational ultrasound 
additionally  most large pharmaceutical companies and many smaller biomedical companies are vigorously pursuing therapeutics to treat patients after heart attacks and other cardiovascular indications 

table of contents we face the risk of product liability claims  which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we may be subject to product liability claims as a result of our testing  manufacturing  and marketing of drugs 
in addition  the use of our product candidates  when and if developed and sold  will expose us to the risk of product liability claims 
product liability may result from harm to patients using our product candidates  such as a complication that was either not communicated as a potential side effect or was more extreme than anticipated 
we require all patients enrolled in our clinical trials to sign consents  which explain various risks involved with participating in the trial 
however  patient consents provide only a limited level of protection  and it may be alleged that the consent did not address or did not adequately address a risk that the patient suffered 
additionally  we will generally be required to indemnify our clinical product manufacturers  clinical trial centers  medical professionals and other parties conducting related activities in connection with losses they may incur through their involvement in the clinical trials 
our ability to reduce our liability exposure for human clinical trials and commercial sales  if any  of tb is dependent in part on our ability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance or to collaborate with third parties that have adequate insurance 
although we intend to obtain and maintain product liability insurance coverage  we cannot guarantee that product liability insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  or that its coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims against us 
a product liability claim  even one without merit or for which we have substantial coverage  could result in significant legal defense costs  thereby potentially exposing us to expenses significantly in excess of our revenues 
governmental and third party payers may subject any product candidates we develop to sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls that could limit our product revenues and delay profitability 
the successful commercialization of our product candidates will likely depend on our ability to obtain reimbursement for the cost of the product and treatment 
government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  are increasingly seeking to lower the prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states  the growth of healthcare maintenance organizations  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could have a significant influence on the purchase of healthcare services and products  resulting in lower prices and reducing demand for our product candidates 
the cost containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could reduce our ability to sell our product candidates and may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we cannot assure you that reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries will be available for any of our product candidates  that any reimbursement granted will be maintained  or that limits on reimbursement available from third party payors will not reduce the demand for  or the price of  our product candidates 
the lack or inadequacy of third party reimbursements for our product candidates would decrease the potential profitability of our operations 
we cannot forecast what additional legislation or regulation relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect the legislation or regulation would have on our business 
clinical trials could be delayed or fail to show efficacy  resulting in additional cost or failure to commercialize our technology platform 
all of our drug candidates are currently in the clinical stage and we cannot be certain that a collaborator or we will successfully complete the clinical trials necessary to receive regulatory product approvals 
this process is lengthy  unpredictable and expensive 
to obtain regulatory approvals  a collaborator or we must ultimately demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda and others that our product candidates are sufficiently safe and effective for their proposed use 
many factors  known and unknown  can adversely impact clinical trials and the ability to evaluate a product candidate s safety and efficacy  including unexpected delays in the initiation of clinical sites  slower than projected enrollment  competition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians  regulatory requirements  limits on manufacturing capacity and failure of a product candidate to meet required standards for administration to humans 
such factors may have a negative impact on our business by making it difficult to advance product candidates or by reducing or eliminating their potential or perceived value 
further  if we are forced to contribute greater financial and clinical resources to a study  valuable resources will be diverted from other areas of our business 

table of contents clinical trials for product candidates such as ours are often conducted with patients who have more advanced forms of a particular condition and or other unrelated conditions 
for example  in clinical trials for our lead product candidate rgn  we have studied patients who are not only suffering from chronic epidermal wounds but are also older and much more likely to have other serious adverse conditions 
during the course of treatment with our product candidates  patients could die or suffer other adverse events for reasons that may or may not be related to the drug candidate being tested 
furthermore  and as a consequence of all of our drug candidates being based on tb  cross over risk exists such that a patient in one trial may be adversely impacted by one drug candidate  and that adverse event may have implications for our other trials and other drug candidates 
however  even if unrelated to our product candidates  such adverse events can nevertheless negatively impact our clinical trials  and our business prospects would suffer 
our ability to complete clinical trials depends on many factors  including obtaining adequate clinical supplies and having a sufficient rate of patient recruitment 
for example  patient recruitment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the perceptions of investigators and patients regarding safety  and the availability of other treatment options 
even if patients are successfully recruited  we cannot be sure they will complete the treatment process 
delays in patient enrollment or treatment in clinical trials may result in increased costs  program delays  or failure  any of which can substantially affect our business or perceived value 
if we fail to complete or if we experience material delays in completing our clinical trials as currently planned  or we otherwise fail to commence or complete  or experience delays in  any of our other present or planned clinical trials  including as a result of the actions of third parties upon which we rely for these functions  our ability to conduct our business as currently planned could materially suffer 
development costs will increase if we experience any future delays in our clinical trials or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than we currently plan 
if the delays or costs are significant  our financial results and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will be adversely affected 
we have no marketing experience  sales force or distribution capabilities 
if our product candidates are approved  and we are unable to recruit key personnel to perform these functions  we may not be able to commercialize them successfully 
although we do not currently have any marketable products  our ability to produce revenues ultimately depends on our ability to sell our product candidates if and when they are approved by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
we currently have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and we do not have a marketing and sales staff or distribution capabilities 
developing a marketing and sales force is also time consuming and could delay the launch of new products or expansion of existing product sales 
in addition  we will compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
if we fail to establish successful marketing and sales capabilities or fail to enter into successful marketing arrangements with third parties  our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

table of contents even if approved for marketing  our technologies and product candidates are unproven and they may fail to gain market acceptance 
our drug candidates  which are all based on the molecule tb  are new and rapidly evolving and have not been shown to be effective on a widespread basis 
our product candidates  and the technology underlying them  are new and unproven and there is no guarantee that health care providers or patients will be interested in our product candidates even if they are approved for use 
our success will depend in part on our ability to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefits  reliability  safety  and cost effectiveness of our product candidates and technology relative to other approaches  as well as on our ability to continue to develop our product candidates to respond to competitive and technological changes 
if the market does not accept our product candidates  when and if we are able to commercialize them  then we may never become profitable 
factors that could delay  inhibit or prevent market acceptance of our product candidates may include the timing and receipt of marketing approvals  the safety and efficacy of the products  the emergence of equivalent or superior products  the cost effectiveness of the products  and ineffective marketing 
it is difficult to predict the future growth of our business  if any  and the size of the market for our product candidates because the markets and technologies are continually evolving 
there can be no assurance that our technologies and product candidates will prove superior to technologies and products that may currently be available or may become available in the future or that our technologies or research and development activities will result in any commercially profitable products 
our technologies and product candidates may have unacceptable side effects that could delay or prevent product approval 
possible side effects of therapeutic technologies may be serious and life threatening 
the occurrence of any unacceptable side effects with our product candidates  during or after pre clinical studies and clinical trials  or the perception or possibility that our product candidates cause or could cause such side effects  could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates and negatively impact our business 
our suppliers may use hazardous and biological materials in their businesses 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly to us  and we are not insured against such claims 
our product candidates and processes involve the controlled storage  use and disposal by our suppliers of certain hazardous and biological materials and waste products 
we and our suppliers and other collaborators are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of materials and waste products 
even if we and these suppliers and collaborators comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and we do not carry insurance for this type of claim 
we may also incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations 

table of contents if we enter markets outside the united states our business will be subject to political  economic  legal and social risks in those markets  which could adversely affect our business 
there are significant regulatory and legal barriers to entering markets outside the united states that we must overcome if we seek regulatory approval to market our product candidates in countries other than the united states 
we would be subject to the burden of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws  including multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting laws 
we also may experience difficulties adapting to new cultures  business customs and legal systems 
any sales and operations outside the united states would be subject to political  economic and social uncertainties including  among others changes and limits in import and export controls  increases in custom duties and tariffs  changes in currency exchange rates  economic and political instability  changes in government regulations and laws  absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights  and currency transfer and other restrictions and regulations that may limit our ability to sell certain product candidates or repatriate profits to the united states 
any changes related to these and other factors could adversely affect our business if and to the extent we enter markets outside the united states 

table of contents risks related to our intellectual property if we are not able to maintain adequate patent protection for our product candidates  we may be unable to prevent our competitors from using our technology or technology that we license 
our success will depend in substantial part on our ability to obtain  defend and enforce patents  maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and abroad 
pursuant to an exclusive worldwide license from the nih  we have exclusive rights under a patent application filed by the nih for the use of tb in the treatment of non healing wounds 
while this patent has issued in certain countries  we cannot guarantee whether or when the patent will be issued or the scope of the patent issued in other countries 
we have attempted to create a substantial intellectual property portfolio  submitting patent applications for various compositions of matter  methods of use and fragments and derivatives of tb we have also in licensed other intellectual property rights from third parties that could be subject to the same risks as our own patents 
if any of these patent applications do not issue  or do not issue in certain countries  or are not enforceable  the ability to commercialize tb in various medical indications could be substantially limited or eliminated 
in addition  the patent positions of the technologies being developed by us and our collaborators involve complex legal and factual uncertainties 
as a result  we cannot assure you that any patent applications filed by us  or by others under which we have rights  will result in patents being issued in the united states or foreign countries 
in addition  there can be no assurance that i any patents will be issued from any pending or future patent applications of ours or our collaborators  ii the scope of any patent protection will be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages  iii any patents obtained by us or our collaborators will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or iv others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights we or our collaborators may hold 
unauthorized parties may try to copy aspects of our product candidates and technologies or obtain and use information we consider proprietary 
policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult 
we cannot guarantee that no harm or threat will be made to our or our collaborators intellectual property 
in addition  changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the united states and other countries may also adversely affect the scope of our patent protection and our competitive situation 
due to the significant time lag between the filing of patent applications and the publication of such patents  we cannot be certain that our licensors were the first to file the patent applications we license or  even if they were the first to file  also were the first to invent  particularly with regards to patent rights in the united states 
in addition  a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents on various technologies that may be related to our operations 
some of these technologies  applications or patents may conflict with our or our licensors technologies or patent applications 
a conflict could limit the scope of the patents  if any  that we or our licensors may be able to obtain or result in denial of our or our licensors patent applications 
if patents that cover our activities are issued to other companies  we may not be able to develop or obtain alternative technology 

table of contents additionally  there is certain subject matter that is patentable in the united states but not generally patentable outside of the united states 
differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in various countries may limit the protection we can obtain outside of the united states 
for example  methods of treating humans are not patentable in many countries outside of the united states 
these and other issues may prevent us from obtaining patent protection outside of the united states  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes to us patent laws could materially reduce any value our patent portfolio may have 
the value of our patents depends in part on their duration 
a shorter period of patent protection could lessen the value of our rights under any patents that may be obtained and may decrease revenues derived from its patents 
for example  the united states patent laws were previously amended to change the term of patent protection from years following patent issuance to years from the earliest effective filing date of the application 
because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications may be more than three years depending on the subject matter  a year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection 
future changes to patent laws could shorten our period of patent exclusivity and may decrease the revenues that we might derive from the patents and the value of our patent portfolio 
we may not have adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition to our patents  we also rely on trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
however  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology 
to protect our trade secrets  we may enter into confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and potential collaborators 
however  we may not have such agreements in place with all such parties and  where we do  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
also  our trade secrets or know how may become known through other means or be independently discovered by our competitors 
any of these events could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates 
we may be subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of former employers 
as is commonplace in the biotechnology industry  we employ now  and may hire in the future  individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies  including competitors or potential competitors 
although there are no claims currently pending against us  we may be subject to claims that we or certain employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
even if we are successful in defending against these claims  litigation could result in substantial costs and would be a significant distraction to management 

table of contents risks related to our common stock our common stock price is volatile  our stock is highly illiquid  and any investment in our stock could decline substantially in value 
for the period from january  through march   our closing stock price has ranged from to with an average daily trading volume of approximately  shares 
in light of our small size and limited resources  as well as the uncertainties and risks that can affect our business and industry  our stock price is expected to continue to be highly volatile and can be subject to substantial drops  with or even in the absence of news affecting our business 
the following factors  in addition to the other risk factors described in this report  and the potentially low volume of trades in our common stock  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  some of which are beyond our control results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials  commercial success of approved products  corporate partnerships  technological innovations by us or competitors  changes in laws and government regulations both in the us and overseas  changes in key personnel at our company  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  public perception relating to the commercial value or safety of any of our product candidates  future sales of our common stock  future issuance of our common stock causing dilution  anticipated or unanticipated changes in our financial performance  general trends related to the biopharmaceutical and biotechnological industries  and general conditions in the stock market 
the stock market in general has recently experienced relatively large price and volume fluctuations 
in particular  the market prices of securities of smaller biotechnology companies have experienced dramatic fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies 
continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock  which could cause a decline in its value 
you should also be aware that price volatility may be worse if the trading volume of the common stock remains limited or declines 
we have never paid dividends on our common stock 
we have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date  and we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to fund the development and growth of our business 
in addition  the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude or limit our ability to pay any dividends 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be your sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future 

table of contents our principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders together control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
included in this group is sigma tau and its affiliates  which together hold outstanding shares representing approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as described elsewhere in this report  in april we entered into an agreement to issue an additional  shares of common stock to affiliates of sigma tau group at per share  and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock  for total proceeds of approximately  we expect that this transaction will  if it closes  increase the ownership of sigma tau to approximately of our outstanding common stock and approximately of our common stock assuming the exercise of their warrants 
a portion of the shares of common stock currently held by sigma tau and its affiliates  representing of our outstanding common stock  are subject to voting agreements under which our board controls the voting power of such stock 
we cannot assure you that such voting agreements would prevent sigma tau and its affiliates from taking actions not in your best interests and effectively exercising control over us 
these voting agreements expire between june and december after such time  we will have no control over the voting of these shares controlled by sigma tau  including with respect to the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock  and therefore may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders 
our rights to repurchase certain shares of stock held by sigma tau expire over time  and we may never be able or elect to exercise these rights 
until june  we have the right to repurchase at a price of per share a number of shares of common stock issued to sigma tau equal to the lesser of the shares sold to sigma tau in connection with our private placement of securities in june  or the number of shares necessary to reduce sigma tau s ownership of our outstanding capital stock to an aggregate of approximately at the time of such repurchase 
in addition  we have the right to repurchase at any time until december   for per share or  at any time between january  and december   for per share  up to  shares of common stock issued to sigma tau in connection with a private placement of securities in february after december   our rights to repurchase common stock held by sigma tau will expire 
these provisions could  under certain circumstances  allow us to reduce dilution by repurchasing these shares at prices lower than the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
however  we cannot assure you that our share price will increase sufficiently to make such repurchases economically feasible or that we would avail ourselves of the opportunity to make such repurchases even if our share price had risen to such a level 
a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that such sales will occur  may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
currently  we are authorized to issue up to  shares of our common stock  and as of march   there were issued and outstanding  shares of our common stock 
the authorized but unissued shares may be issued by us in such transactions and at such times as our board considers appropriate  whether in public or private offerings  as stock splits or dividends or in connection with mergers and acquisitions or otherwise 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the exercise of options and warrants and other issuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock will dilute your interest 
as of march   there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from per share to per share  of which options to purchase  shares were exercisable as of such date 
as of march   there were exercisable warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  at a weighted average exercise price of 
the exercise of options and warrants at prices below the market price of our common stock could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock 
additional dilution may result from the issuance of shares of our capital stock in connection with collaborations or manufacturing arrangements or in connection with other financing efforts 

table of contents any issuance of our common stock that is not made solely to then existing stockholders proportionate to their interests  such as in the case of a stock dividend or stock split  will result in dilution to each stockholder by reducing his  her or its percentage ownership of the total outstanding shares 
moreover  if we issue options or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or we issue restricted stock  stockholders may experience further dilution 
holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle them to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series 
in addition  certain warrants to purchase shares of our common stock currently contain an exercise price above the current market price for the common stock  or above market warrants 
as a result  these warrants may not be exercised prior to their expiration and we may not realize any proceeds from their exercise 
our certificate of incorporation  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a takeover or other change in control  even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
our certificate of incorporation provides our board with the power to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition  under our stockholder rights plan  our board has the discretion to issue certain rights to purchase our capital stock when a person acquires in excess of of our outstanding common shares 
these provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take corporate actions and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control  even if such actions or change in control would be in your best interests 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
subject to specified exceptions  this section provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder  as defined in that statute  during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
this provision could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company 
the foregoing factors could reduce the price that investors or an acquirer might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management s attention and harm our business and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation often is expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could hurt our business  operating results and financial condition

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our operations consist primarily of pre clinical studies and clinical trials related to the development of product candidates based on thymosin beta tb  a amino acid peptide 
currently  we have three tb based drug formulations in clinical development rgn  a topically applied gel product candidate for chronic dermal wounds  rgn  a sterile eye drop for ophthalmic injuries  and rgn  a parenteral injectable formulation for systemic delivery anticipated to be used in a phase ii acute myocardial infarction ami  or heart attack trial 
we are also seeking a partner for development of an inhaled formulation of tb known as rgn that is in preclinical development targeting cystic fibrosis 
in the first quarter of  we completed and reported results from two phase ii dermal wound healing clinical trials using rgn and terminated a proof of concept phase ii ophthalmic wound healing trial using rgn  due to slow enrollment of patients in the trial and the receipt of encouraging data following treatment of four patients with rgn under a separate compassionate use investigational new drug application ind that indicated potential healing effects in patients with non healing corneal ulcers 
subject to our ability to obtain additional financing  we intend to initiate in late or early a new phase ii iii trial to evaluate rgn in a different ophthalmic indication 
we have also finished treating healthy subjects  consisting of subjects in each of two phases  in a phase i clinical trial utilizing rgn to support our cardiovascular clinical program  and to date there have been no reported drug related adverse events 
these healthy subjects will be followed for six months after treatment  at which time we will report final results from this trial 
we are currently enrolling patients in one ongoing phase ii dermal wound healing clinical trial evaluating rgn in the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa  or eb  which we expect to complete no earlier than in an affiliate of sigma tau group  who together with its affiliates are our largest stockholder group  funded all costs associated with one of the phase ii dermal wound healing clinical trials for rgn in the european union 
we have been primarily responsible for the costs associated with the other completed trials as well as the ongoing phase ii trial for eb 
we have incurred net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since inception  and through december   we have an accumulated deficit of million and we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  a significant portion of our operating expenses are variable  as opposed to fixed costs 
accordingly  we believe that we have the ability to reduce costs to offset the results of a prolonged or severe economic downturn 
management has been closely monitoring expenditures and intends to restrict such expenditures to those expenses that are necessary to complete activities related to existing clinical trials  identifying additional sources of working capital and general administrative costs in support of these activities 
we have recently begun a number of efforts to reduce our monthly cash outflows  including salary reductions and reductions in non employee director fees in exchange for stock options to our non employee directors and certain of our employees  and we recently entered into an agreement with affiliates of sigma tau group  our largest stockholder group  to obtain an additional  in equity financing 
based on our operating plan  with our reduced monthly cash outflows and additional funds to be raised from this financing  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will fund our operations into the first quarter of we will need substantial additional funds in order to initiate any further preclinical studies or clinical trials  and to fund our operations beyond early accordingly  we will have a need for financing and are in the process of exploring various alternatives  including  without limitation  a public or private placement of our securities  debt financing  corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements or the sale of our company or certain of our intellectual property rights 

table of contents although we intend to continue to seek additional financing or a strategic partner  we may not be able to complete a financing or corporate transaction  either on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to complete a financing or strategic transaction  we may not be able to continue as a going concern after our funds have been exhausted  and we could be required to significantly curtail or cease operations  file for bankruptcy or liquidate and dissolve 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any sources of funding 
historically  we received only immaterial amounts of revenue from non refundable government grants and do not anticipate future grant revenue 
we have never generated product revenues  and we do not expect to generate product revenues until the fda approves one of our product candidates  if ever  and we begin marketing it 
subject to the availability of financing  we expect to invest increasingly significant amounts in the furtherance of our current clinical programs and may add additional pre clinical studies and new clinical trials as we explore the potential of our current product candidates in other indications and or explore new formulations of tb based product candidates 
consequently  we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
also  we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional outside capital in order to meet product development requirements 
we cannot assure investors that such capital will be available when needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
most of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities r d and general and administrative g a activities 
r d costs include all of the wholly allocable costs associated with our various clinical programs passed through to us by our outsourced vendors 
those costs include manufacturing tb and peptide fragments  formulation of tb into our various product candidates  stability studies for both tb and the various formulations  pre clinical toxicology  safety and pharmacokinetic studies  clinical trial management  medical oversight  laboratory evaluations  statistical data analysis  regulatory compliance  quality assurance  and other related activities 
r d includes cash and non cash compensation  employee benefits  travel and other miscellaneous costs of our internal r d personnel  seven persons in total  who are wholly dedicated to r d efforts 
r d also includes a proration of our common infrastructure costs for office space and communications 
we expense our r d costs as they are incurred 
r d expenditures are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with clinical trials and the fda review and approval process 
as a result  these expenses could exceed our expectations  possibly materially 
we are uncertain as to what we will incur in future research and development costs for our clinical studies  as these amounts are subject to the outcome of current studies  management s continuing assessment of the economics of each individual research and development project and the internal competition for project funding 
g a costs include outside professional fees for legal  audit and accounting services  including the costs to maintain our intellectual property portfolio 
g a also includes cash and non cash compensation  employee benefits  travel and other miscellaneous costs of our internal g a personnel  three in total  who are wholly dedicated to g a efforts 
g a also includes a proration of our common infrastructure costs for office space  and communications 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements that have required us to make significant estimates and judgments are as follows share based payment 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r fas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted to employees after january  and prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to adopting fas r  we accounted for share based payments to employees under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and accordingly  we generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
since our historical data is limited  the expected life was determined in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
guidance for plain vanilla options 
since our historical trading volume is relatively low  we estimated the expected volatility based on monthly closing prices for a period consistent with the expected life of the option 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation and the relative ranges of our historical  underlying assumptions 
costs of pre clinical studies and clinical trials 
we accrue estimated costs for pre clinical studies and clinical trials conducted by contract research organizations and participating hospitals 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we accrue costs for pre clinical studies and clinical trials performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
costs of setting up hospital sites for participation in trials are accrued immediately 
hospital costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
recent accounting pronouncements in september and february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas  and sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas  respectively 
both standards prescribe changes to fair value measurements of certain assets and liabilities and became effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf concludes that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
if and when an entity no longer expects to receive the goods or services contracted  any remaining capitalized  nonrefundable  advance payments should then be charged to expense 
this consensus was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  historically we expensed nonrefundable advance payments when paid 
we determined that approximately  in qualifying transactions required capitalization in accordance with eitf as of january   and we accordingly recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of that date 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
for the year ended december   our revenue decreased by approximately  or  to approximately  from approximately  in our revenue in these years consisted entirely of costs recoverable as revenue through our grant from the nih for trials of rgn to treat the orphan indication eb 
the reduced level of revenue was directly related to the fact that there were less amounts of funding available under this grant during expenses research and development 
for the year ended december   our r d expenditures decreased by approximately million  or  to approximately million  from approximately million in this net decrease is explained by four factors 
first  we incurred approximately million to manufacture tb and dermal clinical drug product in that did not need to be repeated in also in  we initiated our phase ii ophthalmic trial of rgn which required one time  start up costs of approximately million 
these decreases were offset by approximately million in one time costs to initiate our phase ia and phase ib clinical trials evaluating rgn in and approximately million in fees for consultants needed to complete and evaluate our phase ii pressure ulcer trial for rgn  the data from which was reported in early january as described above  we concluded or terminated three phase ii clinical trials during the first quarter of  and we have also incurred the majority of costs to be incurred under phase i trial evaluating rgn our clinical program is actively enrolling patients in only one trial  the phase ii eb trial 
consequently  we expect that our research and development expenditures will decrease for the remainder of and will remain at lower levels unless and until we initiate follow on trials 
expenses general and administrative 
for the year ended december   our g a expenses increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million  from approximately million in the majority of this increase was attributable to increased outside professional fees associated with various business development matters 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have not commercialized any of our product candidates to date and have incurred significant losses since inception 
we have primarily financed our operations through the issuance of common stock and common stock warrants in private and public financings 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the million decrease during results from the use of million in cash for operating activities  offset by million in cash raised through the private placement of common stock and warrants as more fully described in note to our financial statements 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
while our reported net loss for the year ended december  was also approximately million  it included approximately million in non cash expenses  primarily non cash share based compensation  which was offset by a similar amount of cash used to retire current liabilities as compared to the liabilities reported as of december  our net loss in was approximately million higher than our net cash used in operating activities in the same period also due in part to non cash share based compensation expenses that were slightly more than million and an increase in current liabilities over those reported as of december  of approximately million 
the remaining million difference between the net loss and the cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was due to the collection of accounts receivable recorded in net cash provided by used in investing activities 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in both years these amounts relate to the net investments in or sales of short term  highly liquid  investment grade financial instruments 
depending on whether these financial instruments have a maturity date  at time of purchase  of more than days from the date of purchase  the financial instrument is either classified as a short term investment on our balance sheet which is reflected in investing activities  or it is classified as a cash equivalent which is not so reflected 
we had more net qualifying short term investments in than in as a result of our cash management activity 
net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we completed two issuances of common stock that netted approximately million in proceeds after deducting the costs of the transactions 
the amounts provided in relate solely to the exercise of warrants 
future funding requirements the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   we had three product candidates in clinical trials  the development of each of which is primarily accomplished through cancellable third party contracts 
however  as described elsewhere in this report  during we completed two phase ii clinical trials  closed one additional phase ii clinical trial and completed the treatment phase of another phase i clinical trial 
as a result  we are actively enrolling patients in only one trial as of the date of this report 
in order to continue the development of our product candidates  we intend to conduct additional clinical trials  the timing of which is uncertain 

table of contents in addition  the length of time required for clinical trials varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
some of the factors that could impact our liquidity and capital needs include  but are not limited to the progress of our clinical trials  the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our pre clinical development activities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property claims  the costs related to development and manufacture of pre clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory purposes and commercialization of drug supply associated with our product candidates  our ability to enter into corporate collaborations and the terms and success of these collaborations  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the costs of establishing manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities 
in addition  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
also  we test our potential product candidates in numerous pre clinical studies to identify indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
also  our proprietary product candidates also have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
historically  the results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition to our obligations under clinical trials  we are committed under an office space lease that expires on december  that requires monthly rental payments of approximately  in the first quarter of  we also began a number of cash preservation initiatives  including salary reductions and reductions in director fees in exchange for stock options to our non employee directors and certain of our executives and other key employees 
we expect these efforts to preserve approximately  through the end of 
table of contents as described elsewhere in this report  we recently entered into an agreement with affiliates of sigma tau group  our largest stockholder group  to obtain an additional  in equity financing 
based on this financing  our current cash position and our current operating plan  we believe that we will have adequate resources to fund our operations into early  without considering the benefits of any potential future milestone payments that we may receive under our license agreement described below 
sources of liquidity during and  we were dependent on our largest stockholder group  sigma tau group and its affiliates  to provide the necessary funding in order to continue our operations 
in  we raised approximately million from sigma tau and its affiliates through the sale of common stock and warrants 
as described in item of this report under material agreements  we are party to a license agreement with an affiliate of sigma tau pharmaceuticals that provides the opportunity for us to receive milestone payments upon specified events and royalty payments upon commercial sales of tb in europe 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to attain such milestones and generate any such payments under the agreement 
potential sources of outside capital include entering into strategic business relationships  public or private sales of shares of our capital stock  or debt  or other similar financial instruments 
while we closed a private placement of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock involving sigma tau and its affiliates in the fourth quarter of  and these investors have committed to purchase an additional  in common stock and warrants in another private placement  we do not have any other committed sources of outside capital at this time 
consequently  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital in sufficient amounts  on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital through such a strategic business relationship  we may have to give up valuable short and or long term rights to intellectual property 
if we raise funds by selling additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be significantly diluted 
in addition  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of preferred stock or debt securities  these securities are likely to have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock and may involve significant fees  interest expense  restrictive covenants and the granting of security interests in our assets 
our failure to successfully address ongoing liquidity requirements would have a materially negative impact on our business  including the possibility of surrendering our rights to some technologies or product opportunities  delaying our clinical trials  or ceasing operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash equivalents  which are generally comprised of short term us government debt securities  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   these cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
due to the short term nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in fair value would not be material
