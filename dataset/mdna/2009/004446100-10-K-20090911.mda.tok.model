item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide the readers of our financial statements with a narrative discussion about our business 
the md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
our fiscal results were impacted by the economic environment that we operate in  which continues to be quite turbulent 
according to a june  federal reserve statistical release  domestic manufacturing output was more than below its year earlier level and decreased in the month of may 
we are reporting a  decrease in operating income to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year 
net sales for fiscal were  a decrease of  from fiscal this decrease in net sales also impacted our gross profit  which decreased  to  for fiscal our net income decreased to  or per diluted share  a decrease of  or compared to fiscal year our financial position as of june   remains strong  as we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  working capital of  no long term debt and shareholders equity of our business is separated into three principal segments health sciences  chemicals colorants and crop protection 
the health sciences segment is our largest segment in terms of both sales and gross profits 
products that fall within this segment include apis  pharmaceutical intermediates  nutraceuticals and biopharmaceuticals 
we typically partner with both customers and suppliers years in advance of a drug coming off patent to provide the generic equivalent 
we believe we have a pipeline of new apis poised to reach commercial levels over the coming years as the patents on existing drugs expire  both in the united states and europe 
in addition  we continue to explore opportunities to provide a second source option for existing generic drugs with andas 
the opportunities that we are looking for are to supply the apis for the more mature generic drugs where pricing has stabilized following the dramatic decreases in price that these drugs experienced after coming off patent 
as is the case in the generic industry  the entrance into the market of other generic competition generally has a negative impact on the pricing of the affected products 
by leveraging our worldwide sourcing  quality assurance and regulatory capabilities  we believe we can be an alternative lower cost  second source provider of existing apis to generic drug companies 
the chemicals colorants segment is a major supplier to the many different industries that require outstanding performance from chemical raw materials and additives 
products that fall within this segment include intermediates for dyes  pigments and agrochemicals 
we provide chemicals used to make plastics  surface coatings  textiles  lubricants  flavors and fragrances 
many of our raw materials are also used in high tech products like high end electronic parts circuit boards and computer chips and binders for specialized rocket fuels 
we are currently responding to the changing needs of our customers in the color producing industry by taking our resources and knowledge downstream as a supplier of select organic pigments 
the crop protection segment sells herbicides  fungicides  insecticides  and other agricultural chemicals to customers  primarily located in the united states and western europe 
in fiscal  we continued to add products to our crop protection portfolio when we received epa registrations for halosulfuron and glyphosate 
glyphosate is the largest selling herbicide for both crop and non crop use sold in the united states 
we plan to begin marketing glyphosate for the growing season 
in addition  we have two other products that we have already filed with the epa for registrations and several other products that we plan to file for registrations with the epa in fiscal our plan is to continue to develop this pipeline and bring to market additional products in a similar manner 
in may  we sold an insecticide product to its patent owner in conjunction with litigation settlement involving an expired license 
our main business strengths are sourcing  quality assurance  regulatory support  marketing and distribution 
in fiscal  we developed an industrial brand for aceto called enabling quality worldwide and are marketing this brand globally 
with a physical presence in ten countries  we distribute over pharmaceuticals and chemicals used principally as raw materials in the pharmaceutical  agricultural  color  surface coating ink and general chemical consuming industries 
we believe that we are currently the largest buyer of pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals for export from china  purchasing from over different manufacturers 
in this md a  we explain our general financial condition and results of operations  including the following factors that affect our business our earnings and costs in the periods presented changes in earnings and costs between periods sources of earnings the impact of these factors on our overall financial condition as you read this md a  refer to the accompanying consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for the three years ended june  we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of income 
critical accounting estimates and policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we were required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for bad debts  inventories  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  long lived assets  environmental and other contingencies  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on various factors  including historical experience  advice from outside subject matter experts  and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which together form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affected our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of any product when it is shipped and title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we have no acceptance or other post shipment obligations and we do not offer product warranties or services to our customers 
sales are recorded net of returns of damaged goods from customers  which historically have been immaterial  and sales incentives offered to customers 
sales incentives consist primarily of volume incentive rebates 
we record volume incentive rebates as the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer in earning the rebate are recorded  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts relating to estimated losses resulting from customers being unable to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and the industries in which those customers operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their ability to make payments being impaired  additional allowances would be required 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
we write down our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete goods by an amount equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a significant sudden increase in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  we may overestimate or underestimate the demand for our products which would result in our understating or overstating  respectively  the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other indefinite lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  we use many assumptions and estimates that directly impact the results of the testing 
in making these assumptions and estimates  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
if our estimates or our related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
identifiable intangible assets principally consist of customer relationships  product rights and related intangibles  epa registrations and related data  patent license and covenants not to compete 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
environmental and other contingencies we establish accrued liabilities for environmental matters and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably be estimated 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than the accrual  or our share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  we would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period that the determination was made 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we had current net deferred tax assets of and non current net deferred tax assets of  these net deferred tax assets have been recorded based on our projecting that we will have sufficient future earnings to realize these assets  and the net deferred tax assets have been provided for at currently enacted income tax rates 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize a deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net income at that time 
deferred taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since substantially all of these earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in our foreign operations 
a deferred tax liability is recognized when we expect that we will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
in june  we repatriated  of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries resulting in a tax charge of approximately at this time  we do not expect any further repatriation of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
determination of the amount of the unrecognized us income tax liability on undistributed earnings is not practical because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation 
in addition  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards would be available to reduce a portion of such us tax liability 
stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r on july   we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model  including an estimate of forfeitures 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical daily price changes of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
we use historical data to estimate expected dividend yield  expected life and forfeiture rates 
in fiscal  we utilized the simplified method prescribed in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
to estimate the expected life 
for stock option grants issued during fiscal  we used an expected stock price volatility of and an expected life of years 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales by segment year ended june  comparison over under of of segment net sales total net sales total change change health sciences chemicals colorants crop protection net sales gross profit by segment year ended june  comparison over under gross of gross of segment profit sales profit sales change change health sciences chemicals colorants crop protection gross profit net sales net sales decreased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared with  for the prior year 
we reported sales decreases in each of our three segments  as explained below 
health sciences net sales for the health sciences segment decreased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents an decrease over net sales of  for the prior year 
this decrease is due to various factors including decreased sales from our foreign operations of  specifically our german and singapore operations  due primarily to certain customers controlling inventory spending due to the economic recession 
sales of domestic pharmaceutical intermediates  which represent key components used in the manufacture of certain drug products declined by  sales in our domestic generics product group decreased by  as previously mentioned  the forecast for global pharmaceutical sales has declined from the prior prediction 
in addition  we saw a decrease in reorders of existing products 
we expect this difficult market to continue into the upcoming months 
the overall decrease in sales for the health sciences segment is offset  in part  by an increase in sales of  of our domestic nutraceutical products  which represent raw materials used in the production of nutritional supplements 
chemicals colorants net sales for the chemicals colorants segment were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year 
our chemical business is diverse in terms of products  customers and consuming markets and is directly impacted by the overall difficult market conditions we are facing which resulted in our sales in the chemicals and colorants segment to decline from the prior year 
the decrease in sales from this segment is attributable to decreased sales of  in chemicals used in aroma products  a decline of  in sales of color pigments  a  drop in chemicals used to produce surface coatings  a  decrease in miscellaneous organic chemicals and reduced sales of agricultural  dye  pigment and other intermediates which together decreased  sales of chemicals and colorants from our foreign operations also declined by due to reduced demand 
these decreases are partially offset by an increase of  in sales of chemicals utilized in the food  beverage and cosmetic industries and a  increase in sales of polymer additives 
crop protection net sales for the crop protection segment decreased to  for the year ended june   a slight decrease of  or  over net sales of  for the prior year 
the decrease over the prior year is due to a decline in sales of a herbicide which is primarily used on peanuts as the peanut acreage has decreased from sales in the crop protection segment also declined due to decreased sales of our sprout inhibitor products  which are utilized on potato crops  as well as an insecticide in which we were involved in an antitrust case related to certain licensed technology 
in may  we sold this insecticide product to its patent owner in conjunction with litigation settlement involving an expired license 
the decrease in crop protection sales is offset in part  by the launch of halosulfuron  a herbicide used to control sedge on rice  vegetables and turf and ornamental grasses and an increase in sales of asulam  a herbicide used on sugar cane 
gross profit gross profit by segment decreased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
health sciences health sciences gross profit of  for the year ended june  decreased by  or  over the prior year 
the gross margin declined to for the year ended june  compared to for the prior period 
the decrease in gross profit was attributable to the overall decline in sales volume and the decrease in gross margin primarily related to unfavorable product mix on both our domestic pharmaceutical intermediates and domestic nutraceutical products  as well as on our health sciences products sold by our foreign operations  specifically germany and singapore 
gross profit for the domestic pharmaceutical intermediates declined by  and gross profit for our domestic nutraceutical products declined by our foreign operations experienced a drop in gross profit of  over the prior year 
chemicals colorants gross profit for the year ended june   decreased by  or  over the prior year 
the decrease in the gross profit is due to primarily sales volume decline in our domestic operations 
gross margin was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior period 
crop protection gross profit for the crop protection segment increased to  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year  an increase of or 
gross margin for the year ended june  was compared to the prior year gross margin of 
this increase primarily relates to halosulfuron  in which the company first commenced sales on this product in the third quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to for the year ended june  versus for the prior year 
the decrease in sg a is partially attributed to a decrease of  in legal expenses from the prior year for which there is no comparable amount in the current year 
these legal costs in the prior year related to an antitrust case that we previously commenced against the owner of certain licensed technology used with one of our crop protection products  which was settled in may sg a experienced a drop in sales and marketing expenses  which is directly related to the decline in sales 
in addition  in connection with the environmental remediation obligation for arsynco  in july  the company entered into a settlement agreement with the former owners of the arsynco property 
accordingly  the company recorded a gain of  which is included in sg a  related to past environmental costs 
these decreases in sg a are partially offset by higher bad debt expense of as a result of additional reserves 
research and development expenses research and development expenses r d decreased over the prior period to for the year ended june  due to the abandonment of r d related to two finished dosage form generic pharmaceutical products that were to be distributed in europe 
operating income fiscal operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was due to the overall decrease in gross profit of  offset by a  decline in r d expenses and sg a 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net was for the year ended june   which was relatively consistent to the amount of that was in the prior year 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to german tax reform  which was enacted in august  that reduced the german corporate headline tax rate for businesses from to  as well as implementing a cap on interest deductions and tightening the tax basis for trade tax income 
this tax rate reduction became effective for tax years ending after january  due to the future reduction in the overall german tax rate  the deferred income tax asset was revalued during the month of enactment of the tax reform  which was in the first quarter of fiscal  and therefore was reduced by approximately  the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior period is partially offset by charges  including an approximate tax charge related to the repatriation of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries 
at this time  we do not expect any further repatriation of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales by segment year ended june  comparison over under of of segment net sales total net sales total change change health sciences chemicals colorants crop protection net sales gross profit by segment year ended june  comparison over under gross of gross of segment profit sales profit sales change change health sciences chemicals colorants crop protection gross profit net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared with  for the prior year 
we reported sales increases in our health sciences and chemicals colorants segments  which were partially offset by a slight sales decrease in our crop protection segment 
health sciences net sales for the health sciences segment increased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a increase over net sales of  for the prior year 
this increase is due to various factors including increased sales from our foreign operations of  specifically our european operations and a  rise in sales of our pharmaceutical intermediates 
in addition  our domestic generics product group experienced an increase in sales of  the domestic sales increase for the year ended june  was due to the volume of re orders for existing products as well as realization of new products from our pipeline 
we expect the volume of re orders for existing products to continue at a similar rate through the next fiscal year 
chemicals colorants net sales for the chemicals colorants segment were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year 
our chemical business is diverse in terms of products  customers and consuming markets 
the increase in sales from this segment is partially attributable to an increase of  in sales for chemicals used in aroma products   in sales of pigment and dye intermediates  and a  rise in sales of chemicals used to make surface coatings 
in addition  the increase in sales is due to a rise in prices in the chemical industry due to increased demand for chemical products in china 
this increase is offset in part by a  decline in sales of our products sold to the food  beverage and cosmetics industries as a result of the slowdown in the economy 
crop protection net sales for the crop protection segment decreased to  for the year ended june   a decrease of  or  over net sales of  for the prior year 
the overall decrease in net sales was mainly attributable to decreased sales of an herbicide used for sugar cane as well as decreased sales related to an insecticide in which we were involved in an antitrust case related to certain licensed technology 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of an herbicide which is primarily used on peanuts as the peanut acreage has increased from gross profit gross profit by segment increased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
health sciences health sciences gross profit of  for the year ended june   was  or higher than the prior year 
this increase in gross profit was attributable to an  increase in gross profit primarily from our european operations as well as the overall increase in sales volume 
gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to a gross margin of for the prior fiscal year due primarily to favorable product mix in our domestic nutraceutical products  as well as products sold by our european operations  which were more profitable than other products 
chemicals colorants gross profit for the year ended june   increased by  or  over the prior year 
gross margin was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior period 
the increase in the gross profit and gross margin percentage primarily relates to the increase in sales volume and positive product mix on aroma chemicals 
in addition  there was a settlement of an anti dumping claim included in the prior year cost of sales 
crop protection gross profit for the crop protection segment decreased to  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year  a decrease of  or 
gross margin for the year ended june  was compared to the prior period gross margin of 
the primary reason for the decrease in the gross profit and gross margin percentage primarily relates to a decline in sales volume of a particular herbicide and insecticide as described above in the crop protection net sales section 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a remained consistent at for fiscal the increase in sg a is partially attributed to an increase of  in legal expenses  the majority of which was incurred relating to an antitrust case that the company previously commenced against the owner of certain licensed technology used with one of our crop protection products  which was settled in may sg a also increased due to a  rise in personnel related costs  of which  relates to our foreign operations and  relates to various factors including annual salary increases  stock based compensation and increased bonus expense as a result of increased profitability 
in addition  commission expense increased by due to increased sales 
additionally  the prior year amount was reduced by of proceeds received from credit insurance  of which there was no comparable amount received during the year ended june  research and development expenses research and development expenses r d increased over the prior year to for the year ended june  r d relates to the development of two finished dosage form generic pharmaceutical products to be distributed in europe 
operating income fiscal operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to the overall increase in gross profit of  offset in part by the  increase in sg a and r d expenses 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net was for fiscal versus for fiscal the primary reason for this fluctuation is due to changing the functional currency of our chinese subsidiaries from the chinese renminbi to the us dollar  since these subsidiaries primarily generate and expend cash in the us dollar 
as a result  we recorded a correction of an error in the third quarter of  which resulted in additional interest and other income  net of approximately  which represented approximately after tax profit 
we did not deem this adjustment to be material to any prior quarters in fiscal based upon both quantitative and qualitative factors 
in addition  this adjustment does not impact the year to date reported results 
this matter was not corrected for periods prior to june  due to the immateriality of the effects of this in earlier years 
beginning in  the chinese government began to revalue the chinese renminbi against other currencies  including the us dollar 
the decision by the chinese government to no longer peg the renminbi to the us dollar has caused a reduction in value of dollar denominated assets held in china  which was particularly experienced in fiscal the increase in interest and other income  net was partially offset by a decrease in other income related to a government subsidy paid annually for doing business in a free trade zone in shanghai  china and a increase in unrealized loss on trading securities 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to german tax reform  which was enacted in august  that reduced the corporate headline tax rate for businesses from to  as well as implementing a cap on interest deductions and tightening the tax basis for trade tax income 
this tax rate reduction became effective for tax years ending after january  due to the future reduction in the overall german tax rate  the deferred income tax asset was revalued during the month of enactment of the tax reform  which was in the first quarter of fiscal  and therefore was reduced by approximately  which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  without this adjustment  the fiscal effective tax rate would have been 
additionally  tax reform has taken place in china and effective january   the corporate headline tax rate was increased to from 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows at june   we had  in cash  of which  was outside the united states  in short term investments and no outstanding bank loans 
the  of cash held outside of the united states is fully accessible to meet any liquidity needs of the countries in which aceto operates 
the majority of the cash located outside of the united states is held by our european operations and can be transferred into the united states 
although these amounts are fully accessible  transferring these amounts into the united states or any other countries could have certain tax consequences 
a deferred tax liability will be recognized when we expect that we will recover undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
a portion of our cash is held in operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
our cash position at june  increased  from the amount at june  operating activities for the year ended june  provided cash of  as compared to cash provided by operations of  for the comparable period 
the  was comprised of  in net income   derived from adjustments for non cash items and a net  increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the non cash items included  in depreciation and amortization expense   in stock compensation  for the provision for doubtful accounts and for the deferred income taxes provision 
trade accounts receivable decreased  during the year ended june   due to decreased sales during the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  as well as a significant improvement in days sales outstanding 
inventories and accounts payable decreased by approximately  and  respectively  due primarily to a reduction of inventories in both our domestic health sciences and chemicals and colorants segments as a result of the company carrying less inventory due to the current market conditions of the economy 
in addition  the company carried more stock as of june  for certain products of both the chemicals and colorants and health sciences segments that were purchased from china  due to a supplier interruption related to the olympics that were held in china in august of some of this additional stock did not ship until the first and second quarters of our european operations also experienced a decline in inventory from june  due to a ramp up in orders during the fourth quarter of that did not ship until the first and second quarters of accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased  during the year ended june   due primarily to a decrease in accrued compensation and a decline in accrued income tax payable  due to the timing of income tax payments partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses related to an increase in value added tax vat for our foreign subsidiaries 
other receivables increased  due to an increase in vat taxes receivables in our european subsidiaries and increased receivables related to certain crop protection products 
our cash position at june  increased  from the amount at june  operating activities for the year ended june  provided cash of  as compared to cash provided by operations of  for the comparable period 
the  was comprised of  in net income and  derived from adjustments for non cash items  offset by a net  decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the primary reason for the increase in cash provided by operations from to relates to the increase in net income  as well as the inventories increased more during the year compared to  as a result of a ramp up in orders for products to be shipped in the first quarter of and an increase in products in which we have decided  at that time  to carry stock 
our cash position at june  decreased  from the amount at june  operating activities for the year ended june  provided cash of  as compared to cash provided by operations of  for the comparable period 
the  was comprised of  in net income and  derived from adjustments for non cash items  offset by a net  decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities  the majority of which related to inventory 
investing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily related to the purchase of investments of  the acquisition of  of product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency and payments to various task force groups related to certain crop protection products   of the issuance of a notes receivable related to a supplier agreement and related to purchases of property and equipment 
we expect capital expenditures will be between  and  during fiscal in addition  the lease for our general headquarters and sales office expires in april the company is contemplating a buy versus lease decision with regards to a new building 
if we were to purchase a new facility  the amount expended in the next fiscal year could approximate  for this new facility 
cash used in investing activities is offset in part by  of maturities of investments  from payments of notes receivable and proceeds from sale of intangible assets of investing activities for the year ended june  provided cash of  primarily related to maturities and sale of investments of  and proceeds from sale of intangible assets of cash provided by investing activities is offset in part by the purchases of property and equipment of  investing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily related to purchases of investments of  and purchases of property and equipment and intangibles of and  respectively  including  for the asulam product registration and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency and state regulatory agencies to support such registrations and other supporting data 
the amount of cash used for investing activities is offset in part by  of maturities of investments 
financing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily from the payment of  of dividends and a payment of a note payable partly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  financing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily from the payments of dividends of  financing activities for the year ended june  used cash of  primarily from the payments of dividends of credit facilities we have available credit facilities with certain foreign financial institutions 
these facilities provide us with a line of credit of  as of june  we are not subject to any financial covenants under these arrangements 
in june  we amended our revolving credit agreement with a financial institution that expires june   and provides for available credit of  at june   we had utilized in letters of credit  leaving  of this facility unused 
under the credit agreement  we may obtain credit through direct borrowings and letters of credit 
our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and are secured by of the capital of certain of our non domestic subsidiaries 
there is no borrowing base on the credit agreement 
interest under the credit agreement is at libor plus 
the credit agreement contains several covenants requiring  among other things  minimum levels of debt service and tangible net worth 
we are also subject to certain restrictive debt covenants  including covenants governing liens  limitations on indebtedness  guarantees  sale of assets  sales of receivables  and loans and investments 
we were in compliance with all covenants at june  working capital outlook working capital was  at june   versus  at june  the decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to the acquisition of product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency and payments to various task force groups related to certain crop protection products 
we continually evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses that are complementary to our own  and such transactions may require the use of cash 
in connection with our crop protection business  we plan to continue to acquire product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency as well as payments to various task force groups  which could approximate  over the next fiscal year 
in addition  the lease for our general headquarters and sales office expires in april the company is contemplating a buy versus lease decision with regards to a new building 
if we were to purchase a new facility  the amount expended in the next fiscal year could approximate  we believe that our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  borrowing capacity and access to the equity capital markets  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating expenditures and the anticipated continuation of semi annual cash dividends for the next twelve months 
we are currently looking into obtaining additional credit facilities to enhance our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments and contingencies we have no material financial commitments other than those under operating lease agreements  letters of credit and unconditional purchase obligations 
we have certain contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments that will affect our short and long term liquidity 
at june   we had no significant obligations for capital expenditures 
at june   contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments were as follows payments due and or amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years operating leases commercial letters of credit standby letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations total other significant commitments and contingencies include the following a subsidiary of the company markets certain agricultural chemicals which are subject to the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 
fifra requires that test data be provided to the epa to register  obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products 
the epa requires that follow on registrants of these products compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the fifra regulations 
follow on registrants do not themselves generate or contract for the data 
however  when fifra requirements mandate that new test data be generated to enable all registrants to continue marketing a pesticide product  often both the initial and follow on registrants establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort 
the company is presently a member of several such task force groups  which requires payments for such memberships 
in addition  in connection with our crop protection business  the company plans to acquire product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency to support such registrations and other supporting data for three products 
the acquisition of these product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency as well as payments to various task force groups could approximate  over the next fiscal year 
we  together with our subsidiaries  are subject to pending and threatened legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of business 
we do not know how the final resolution of these matters will affect our results of operations in a particular reporting period 
our management is of the opinion  however  that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or liquidity 
the company has environmental remediation obligations in connection with arsynco  inc arsynco  a subsidiary formerly involved in manufacturing chemicals located in carlstadt  new jersey  which was closed in and is currently held for sale 
during fiscal  based on continued monitoring of the contamination at the site and the approved plan of remediation  the company received an estimate from an environmental consultant stating that the costs of remediation could be between  and  as of june  and  a liability of  and  respectively  is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for this matter 
in accordance with eitf issue  capitalization of costs to treat environmental contamination  management believes that the majority of costs incurred to remediate the site will be capitalized in preparing the property which is currently classified as held for sale 
an appraisal of the fair value of the property by a third party appraiser supports the assumption that the expected fair value after the remediation is in excess of the amount required to be capitalized 
however  these matters  if resolved in a manner different from those assumed in current estimates  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period 
in connection with the environmental remediation obligation for arsynco  in july  the company entered into a settlement agreement with basf corporation basf  the former owners of the arsynco property 
according to the settlement agreement  basf will pay for a portion of the prior remediation costs and going forward  will co remediate the property with the company 
the contract states that basf  within twenty days of establishing a trust account  will pay the company related to past response costs and pay a proportionate share of the future remediation costs 
accordingly  the company has recorded a gain of  which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  this gain relates to the partial reimbursement of costs of approximately  that the company had previously expensed 
the company also recorded an additional receivable from basf  with an offset against property held for sale  for  representing its estimated portion of the future remediation costs  which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of june  in march  arsynco received notice from the epa of its status as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla for a site described as the berry s creek study area 
arsynco is one of over prps which have potential liability for the required investigation and remediation of the site 
the estimate of the potential liability is not quantifiable for a number of reasons  including the difficulty in determining the extent of contamination and the length of time remediation may require 
in addition  any estimate of liability must also consider the number of other prps and their financial strength 
based on prior practice in similar situations  it is possible that the state may assert a claim for natural resource damages with respect to the arsynco site itself  and either the federal government or the state or both may assert claims against arsynco for natural resource damages in connection with berry s creek  any such claim with respect to berry s creek could also be asserted against the approximately prps which the epa has identified in connection with that site 
any claim for natural resource damages with respect to the arsynco site itself may also be asserted against basf  the former owners of the arsynco property 
since an amount of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated at this time  no accrual is recorded for these potential future costs 
the impact of the resolution of this matter on the company s results of operations in a particular reporting period is not known 
however  management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
in fiscal years  and  the company received letters from the pulvair site group  a group of potentially responsible parties prp group who are working with the state of tennessee the state to remediate a contaminated property in tennessee called the pulvair site 
the prp group has alleged that aceto shipped hazardous substances to the site which were released into the environment 
the state had begun administrative proceedings against the members of the prp group and aceto with respect to the cleanup of the pulvair site and the group has begun to undertake cleanup 
the prp group is seeking a settlement of approximately  from the company for its share to remediate the site contamination 
although the company acknowledges that it shipped materials to the site for formulation over twenty years ago  the company believes that the evidence does not show that the hazardous materials sent by aceto to the site have significantly contributed to the contamination of the environment and thus believes that  at most  it is a de minimus contributor to the site contamination 
accordingly  the company believes that the settlement offer is unreasonable 
the impact of the resolution of this matter on the company s results of operations in a particular reporting period is not known 
however  management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in investment market prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
investment market price risk we had short term investments of at june  those short term investments consisted of time deposits and corporate equity securities 
time deposits are short term in nature and are accordingly valued at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
corporate equity securities are recorded at fair value and have exposure to price risk 
if this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges  the effect of that risk would be as of june  actual results may differ 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we hedge some of our transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various entities 
the instruments used for hedging are short term foreign currency contracts futures 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the currency of the related hedged transactions 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding that had a notional amount of  the difference between the fair market value of the foreign currency contracts and the related commitments at inception and the fair market value of the contracts and the related commitments at june   was not material 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on june   we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies  with the most significant being the euro 
the potential loss as of june   resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounted to  actual results may differ 
interest rate risk due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly affect our results of operations
