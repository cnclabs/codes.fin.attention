item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general we are a leading manufacturer of metal and plastic consumer goods packaging products 
we currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products  and custom designed plastic containers  tubes and closures for personal care  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  food  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical products 
we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit volume market share for the year ended december  of approximately half of the market in the united states  a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products and a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for a variety of markets  including the personal care  health care  household and industrial chemical and food markets 
our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business  reduce operating costs  build sustainable competitive positions  or franchises  and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns 
we have grown our net sales and income from operations largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth  and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market 
acquisitions in february  we acquired vem  the metal vacuum closures operations of grup vemsa  sl  for an aggregate purchase price of million  strengthening our position in the growing southern european and asian markets 
in june  we acquired the white cap operations in europe from amcor 
additionally  we acquired the white cap operations in the philippines and china in december  in venezuela in january and in brazil in april white cap is a leading supplier of an extensive range of vacuum closures to consumer goods packaging companies in the food and beverage industries 
the white cap operations that we acquired in europe  asia and south america have been recombined with our previously acquired white cap closures operations in the united states to create a global leader in vacuum closures for hot filled and retortable food and beverage products 
at the respective closings  we paid an aggregate of million for white cap  including acquisition fees  net of cash actually acquired of million  financed primarily through euro borrowings under our credit agreement 
as part of the acquisitions  we assumed million of indebtedness 
in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of cousins currie  a leading manufacturer in canada of larger size custom designed plastic containers 
the purchase price of million was financed primarily with canadian dollar borrowings under our credit agreement 

table of contents sales growth we have increased net sales and market share in our metal food container  closures and plastic container businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result  we have expanded and diversified our customer base  geographic presence and product lines 
during the past twenty years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self manufacture their metal food containers 
our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestl  dial  del monte  birds eye  campbell and pacific coast reflect this trend 
we estimate that approximately percent of the market for metal food containers is still served by self manufacturers 
the metal food container market in north america was relatively flat during this period  despite losing market share as a result of more dining out  fresh produce and competing materials 
however  we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the united states primarily through acquisitions  and we have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and value added features such as our quick top easy open ends  shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers 
we anticipate that the market will be relatively flat in the future  but will continue to increase in areas of consumer convenience products such as single serve sizes and easy open ends 
in  percent of our metal food containers sold had a quick top easy open end  representing an increase in unit sales of this value added feature of percent since with our acquisition in march of silgan white cap llc  our former closures joint venture with amcor in which we held a minority position  we became a leading manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
prior to our acquisition in march  this business was the north american operations of the worldwide white cap business 
with our acquisition of the white cap operations in europe  asia and south america  we reunited these businesses and reestablished it as a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products  with leadership positions in the north american and european markets 
we have improved the market position of our plastic container business since  with net sales increasing more than sevenfold to million in we achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth 
the plastic container market of the consumer goods packaging industry is highly fragmented  with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials 
we have focused on the segment of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care 
we intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value added operating expertise and strategy 
operating performance we operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
we have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
our acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling 
from  we have closed three metal food container manufacturing facilities  one closures manufacturing facility and two plastic container manufacturing facilities in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations  reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand 
we have also invested substantial capital in the past few years for new market opportunities and value added products such as new quick top easy open ends for metal food containers  shaped metal 
table of contents food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers 
over the past five years  we have invested million in capital to invest in new market opportunities  maintain our market position  improve our productivity and reduce our manufacturing costs 
historically  we have been successful in renewing our multi year supply arrangements with our customers such as our metal food container supply agreements with our two largest customers  nestl through for approximately percent of our sales to nestl and through for our remaining sales to nestl and campbell through 
we estimate that in approximately percent of our projected metal food container sales  a majority of our projected closures sales in the united states and a majority of our projected plastic container sales will be under multi year arrangements 
many of our multi year customer supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material  labor and other manufacturing costs  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
in recent years  the steel industry in the united states announced significant price increases for steel 
under our supply arrangements  we were able to increase prices to pass through higher steel costs 
for our non contract customers  we also increased prices to pass through higher steel costs 
resin prices have also fluctuated significantly in the past few years  and we have been able to pass through changes in resin costs in accordance with our supply arrangements 
our metal food container business sales and income from operations are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
our closures business is also dependent  in part  upon vegetable and fruit harvests 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter 
additionally  as is common in the packaging industry  we provide extended payment terms to some of our customers in our metal food container business due to the seasonality of the vegetable and fruit packing process 
use of capital historically  we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns 
our stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of our long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports our financial strategy 
we intend to continue using reasonable leverage  supported by our stable cash flows  to make value enhancing acquisitions 
in determining reasonable leverage  we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions 
if acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time  we may use our cash flow to repay debt  repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted uses 
in light of the ongoing general credit market issues  we have maintained a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents since to ensure our access to liquidity in this tumultuous credit environment 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
in at least the short term  we will continue to maintain elevated levels of cash and cash equivalents based on our assessment of the condition of the credit markets 
to the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  our interest expense may increase 
further  since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  our interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  we had million of indebtedness  or percent of our total outstanding indebtedness  which bore interest at floating rates 
you should read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report for information regarding our interest rate swap agreements

year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to principally due to higher average selling prices across all businesses primarily as a result of the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs  favorable foreign currency translation and increased volumes in the metal food container and closure businesses  partially offset by a decline in volumes in the plastic container business 
income from operations in increased by million  or percent  as compared to due to stronger earnings across all businesses  partially offset by a million increase in rationalization charges 
our results for and included rationalization charges of million and million  respectively 
net income in increased million to million as compared to net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was the result of higher net sales across all businesses 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs as well as slightly higher unit volumes 
net sales for the closures business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was primarily the result of slightly higher unit volumes which included sales from operations acquired in in brazil  spain and china  favorable foreign currency translation of million and higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material costs  partially offset by the impact from weaker demand for single serve beverage products later in 
table of contents net sales for the plastic container business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was principally attributable to higher average selling prices as a result of the pass through of higher raw material costs  partially offset by slightly lower unit volumes due to general market declines 
gross profit 
gross profit margin decreased to percent in as compared to percent in for the reasons discussed below in income from operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales remained unchanged at percent in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses in increased million as compared to due primarily to the impact of foreign currency and the inclusion of the closures operations acquired in income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to  while operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations for and included rationalization charges of million and million  respectively 
income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods despite the mathematical consequence of passing through significant manufacturing cost inflation to our customers in the form of price increases during the year 
the increases in income from operations and operating margin were the result of benefits derived from continued cost control and manufacturing efficiencies  a million reduction in rationalization charges in as compared to and slightly higher unit volumes  partially offset by the negative effects of a substantial reduction in inventories during the fourth quarter of and the impact of higher depreciation expense 
income from operations of the closures business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these decreases were attributable to rationalization charges of million in related to the shut down of the manufacturing facility in turkey and the consolidation of various administrative positions in europe as well as significant inflation in manufacturing and other costs 
these decreases were partially offset by rationalization benefits  ongoing cost controls  improved manufacturing efficiencies and slightly higher unit volumes 
income from operations of the plastic container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations and operating margin increased primarily as a result of the benefit from the lag effect of passing through to our customers significant resin price declines which occurred in the fourth quarter of  as well as ongoing cost controls  rationalization benefits and improved manufacturing performance 
these increases were partially offset by manufacturing cost inflation and a slight decline in unit volumes 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense for decreased million to million as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower market interest rates and higher interest income attributable to more cash and cash equivalents held during  partially offset by the effects of higher average borrowings as we maintained higher revolving loan borrowings to ensure access to liquidity in the current general credit crisis 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in the effective tax rate benefited from tax credits relating to certain non recurring state tax incentives and research and development credits  partially offset by a valuation allowance established to offset deferred tax benefits related to net operating losses in turkey as a result of our decision to close the manufacturing facility in turkey 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to principally due to the full year impact from the acquisitions of the international closures operations and cousins currie  higher average selling prices across all businesses primarily as a result of the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs  improved volumes in each business and favorable foreign currency translation 
income from operations in increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase in income from operations was due to stronger results across all three businesses and the impact of million lower rationalization charges versus our results for and included rationalization charges of million and million  respectively 
our results for also included a tax benefit  net of fees  of million  on an after tax basis 
net income in increased million to million as compared to net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was the result of higher net sales across all businesses 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs as well as slightly higher unit volumes 
net sales for the closures business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was primarily the result of the full year impact from the acquisition of the international closures operations  favorable foreign currency translation of million  strong unit volume increases and higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material costs 
net sales for the plastic container business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was principally a result of the cousins currie acquisition  improved unit volumes and higher average selling prices as a result of the pass through of higher raw material costs  partially offset by a less favorable mix of products sold 
gross profit 
gross profit margin increased to percent in as compared to percent in for the reasons discussed below in income from operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased percentage points to percent in as compared to percent in  due primarily to the inclusion for the full year of the international closures operations which incur such expenses at a higher percentage of its sales than our other operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included the incurrence of million of tax professional fees for research and development and repatriation tax initiatives 
income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations for and included rationalization charges of million and million  respectively 
income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these increases were the result of million lower rationalization charges in  benefits derived from ongoing cost reduction initiatives including from plant closings completed during the year  slightly higher unit volumes and improved manufacturing performance 
these benefits were partially offset by the negative cost impact in attributable to the reduction of provisional inventory as compared to the benefits of building this inventory in in anticipation of certain union negotiations which were completed in 
table of contents income from operations of the closures business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  while operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
the increase in income from operations was primarily attributable to the full year effect of the international closures acquisition  improved volumes and continued cost reductions across the closures business 
the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the inclusion for the full year of the international operations which generally incur selling  general and administrative expenses at a higher percentage of sales as compared to the domestic operations 
income from operations of the plastic container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations and operating margin increased primarily as a result of the impact of the cousins currie acquisition  a million reduction in rationalization charges in  improved volumes and the benefits of productivity improvements and cost reductions 
these benefits were partially offset by the negative effect of resin cost increases and the timing of the corresponding customer price pass through and a less favorable mix of products sold 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense for increased million to million as compared to this increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the term loan borrowings of million and cdn million to finance our acquisitions of white cap and cousins currie  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the cumulative prior year benefits of tax initiatives related to research and development tax credits recorded in  partly offset by lower statutory rates associated with the acquired international operations 
capital resources and liquidity our principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments  including our credit agreement 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of our seasonal working capital needs 
in  we used cash from operations of million  net borrowings of revolving loans of million  other debt borrowings of million for the acquisition of vem and net proceeds from stock based compensation issuances of million to fund net capital expenditures of million  the repayment of debt of million  our acquisitions of vem and the white cap operations in brazil for million net of cash acquired  decreases in outstanding checks of million and dividends paid on our common stock of million and to increase cash and cash equivalents by million 
in  changes in working capital generated cash of million as compared to million in this increase was due primarily to the timing of payments at the end of at the end of and during  in light of the ongoing general credit crisis  we maintained a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents to ensure access to liquidity in this tumultuous credit environment 
our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million 
cash equivalents are primarily invested in us treasury instruments and us government backed securities 
we will continue to evaluate our level of cash and cash equivalents based on our assessment of the condition of the credit markets 
in  we used cash from operations of million and net proceeds from stock based compensation issuances of million to fund our acquisition of the white cap operations in venezuela 
table of contents for million net of cash acquired  net capital expenditures of million  decreases in outstanding checks of million  net payments of debt of million and dividends paid on our common stock of million and to increase cash and cash equivalents by million 
in  changes in working capital generated cash of million as compared to using cash of million in  due primarily to the use of provisional inventory built in in anticipation of certain union negotiations which were completed in and the timing of payments and cash receipts at the end of in  we used cash from operations of million  net borrowings of revolving loans of million  net borrowings of long term debt of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and net proceeds from stock based compensation issuances of million to fund our acquisitions for million net of cash acquired  net capital expenditures of million  decreases in outstanding checks of million  debt issuance costs of million incurred in connection with our additional borrowings under our credit agreement and dividends paid on our common stock of million 
in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  payable on march  to the holders of record of our common stock on march  the cash payment for this quarterly dividend is expected to be approximately million 
at december   we had million of total consolidated indebtedness 
in addition  at december   after taking into account letters of credit of million  we had million and cdn million of revolving loans available to be borrowed under our credit agreement 
under our credit agreement  we also have available to us an uncommitted incremental loan facility in an amount of up to an additional million  and we may incur additional indebtedness as permitted by our credit agreement and our other instruments governing our indebtedness 
revolving loans under our credit agreement may be used for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
revolving loans may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed over the life of our credit agreement until their final maturity on june  at december  and  there were no revolving loans outstanding under our credit agreement 
because we sell metal containers used in the fruit and vegetable packing process  we have seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the packing season 
due to our seasonal requirements  we incur short term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements 
for  and  the average amount of revolving loans outstanding under our credit agreement  including seasonal borrowings  was million  million and million  respectively  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the highest amount of such borrowings  was million  million and million  respectively 
in  the average amount of revolving loans outstanding attributable to our seasonal working capital needs was million 
revolving loans borrowed in included million borrowed in the third quarter to ensure liquidity in light of the ongoing general credit crisis 
this revolving loan borrowing was repaid in the fourth quarter of during  we may borrow revolving loans  increasing our cash and cash equivalents balance  to ensure access to liquidity based on our evaluation of the credit markets 
for  we estimate that we will utilize approximately million of revolving loans under our credit agreement for our peak seasonal working capital requirements  which amount could be lower to the extent we utilize cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we may use the available portion of our revolving loan facilities  after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit  for acquisitions and other permitted purposes 

table of contents in addition to our operating cash needs  we believe our cash requirements over the next few years will consist primarily of annual capital expenditures of to million  principal amortization payments of bank term loans under our credit agreement and other outstanding debt agreements of million in  million in  million in and million in  cash payments for quarterly dividends on our common stock of approximately million assuming our board of directors continues to approve dividends at the same level  annual payments to satisfy employee withholding tax requirements resulting from certain restricted stock units becoming vested  which payments are dependent upon the price of our common stock at the time of vesting and the number of restricted stock units that vest  none of which is estimable at this time payments in were not significant  our interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and bank term loans under our credit agreement  which bear fluctuating rates of interest  and the notes  payments of approximately to million for federal  state and foreign tax liabilities in as a result of recent tax laws  which may increase annually thereafter  and payments of approximately million for pension benefit plan contributions in which were made in february  which may change annually thereafter based on the funded status of our pension benefit plans 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service  tax obligations  pension benefit plan contributions  share repurchases required under our stock incentive plan and common stock dividends for the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under our credit agreement  to finance any such acquisition 
our credit agreement and the indenture with respect to the notes contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  sell assets  pay dividends and engage in certain transactions 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during with all of these covenants 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations at december  are provided below payment due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions long term debt obligations interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other postretirement benefit obligations total these amounts represent expected cash payments of our long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our fixed rate long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our variable rate long term debt  after taking into consideration our interest rate swap agreements  at prevailing interest rates at december  purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures 
obligations that are cancelable without penalty are excluded 
other postretirement benefit obligations have been actuarially determined through the year based on current legislation  there are no significant minimum required contributions to our pension benefit plans in however  this is subject to change based on a number of factors  including further governmental interpretations of certain provisions of the pension protection act of in order to reduce our unfunded pension liability  we have historically made contributions in excess of the erisa minimum requirements that are tax deductible 
based on our current funded status  we made voluntary contributions to our pension benefit plans of approximately million in february at december   we also had outstanding letters of credit of million that were issued under our credit agreement 
you should also read notes   and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on us  other than to increase our cost of borrowing 
in general  we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials subject to contractual lag periods for resin costs and to significantly reduce the exposure of our results of operations to increases in other costs  such as labor and other manufacturing costs 
because we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  after taking into 
table of contents account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  we pay fixed rates of interest ranging from percent to percent and receive floating rates of interest based on three month libor or euribor  as appropriate 
these agreements mature as follows million and cdn million in  million in and million in depending upon market conditions  we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in our judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility 
rationalization charges in  as part of our ongoing effort to streamline operations and reduce costs  we approved plans to close our metal food container manufacturing facility in tarrant  alabama  our plastic container manufacturing facility in richmond  virginia and our closures manufacturing facility in turkey and to consolidate various administrative positions within our european closures operations 
in february  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our tarrant  alabama metal food container manufacturing facility 
our plan included the termination of approximately employees and other related plant exit costs 
total costs of million for the rationalization of this facility were recognized in and consisted of million for employee severance and benefits  million for plant exit costs and million for the acceleration of depreciation to write down equipment for abandonment upon the exit of the facility  offset by million for a non cash curtailment gain for other postretirement benefits 
we have ceased operations at this facility and expect to sell the building for estimated proceeds at or in excess of its net book value 
remaining cash payments of million are expected in in march  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our richmond  virginia plastic container manufacturing facility 
our plan included the termination of approximately employees and other related plant exit costs 
we estimate that the total costs for the rationalization of this facility will be million 
these costs include million for employee severance and benefits  million for plant exit costs and million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
we recognized substantially all of these costs in and have ceased operations at this facility 
additional charges of million for plant exit costs are expected in remaining cash payments of million are expected in during  we approved and announced to employees in our closures business plans to consolidate various administrative positions and streamline operations in europe and exit our closures manufacturing facility in turkey 
our plans included the termination of approximately employees  the relocation of certain operations into existing facilities and other related plant exit costs 
we estimate that the total costs for this rationalization will be million 
these costs include million for employee severance and benefits  million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets and million for plant exit costs 
we have recognized substantially all of these costs in and have ceased operations at the turkey facility 
additional charges of million for employee severance and benefits are expected in remaining cash payments of million are expected in in  we approved and announced plans to exit three facilities  our metal food container manufacturing facilities in st 
paul  minnesota and stockton  california and our plastic container manufacturing facility in valencia  california 
under these plans  we terminated a total of employees and estimate that total charges will be million  of which million  million and million were recognized in  and  respectively 
we have ceased operations at these three facilities and expect to sell the owned facilities for proceeds at or in excess of their respective net book values 

table of contents under our rationalization plans  we made cash payments of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additional cash spending of approximately million is expected for our plans  including million in and million thereafter 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
we continually evaluate cost reduction opportunities in our business  including rationalizations of our existing facilities through plant closings and downsizings 
we use a disciplined approach to identify opportunities that generate attractive cash returns 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our accounting policies for pension expense and obligations  rationalization charges and acquisition reserves and testing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
you should also read our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate represents the market rate for non callable high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension benefit plans 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense  while an increase in the discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases pension expense 
a basis point change in the discount rate would impact our annual pension expense by approximately million 
for  we decreased our domestic discount rate from percent to percent to reflect market interest rate conditions 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension benefit plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets will remain at percent in the funded status of our pension benefit plans decreased million in due primarily to a significant decrease in our actual return on plan assets as compared to our expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the resulting actuarial losses are amortized to pension benefit cost over the remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the pension benefit plans 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
historically  we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plans for the acquired entities  which includes eliminating operating redundancies  facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed 
we also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements 
table of contents and  when deemed appropriate  we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities 
establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
our tests for impairment require us to make assumptions regarding the expected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units 
these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts 
developing these assumptions requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from these forecasts

r requires that any changes in an acquired deferred tax account or related valuation allowance that occur after the effective date of adoption will be recognized as adjustments to income tax expense 
we do not expect that the initial adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  our unrecognized tax benefit positions will impact our effective tax rate if recognition of such positions is required subsequent to the adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and  with respect to our international closures operations and our canadian plastic container operations  from foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we also have risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks 
interest rate  foreign currency and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our net income and cash flow 
to achieve our objective  we regularly evaluate the amount of our variable rate debt as a percentage of our aggregate debt 
during and  our average outstanding variable rate debt  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements  was percent and percent of our average outstanding total debt  respectively 
we manage a significant portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in our variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest 
we have entered into these agreements with banks under our credit agreement  and our obligations under these agreements are guaranteed and secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under our credit agreement 
you should also read notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the principal and notional amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
based on the average outstanding amount of our variable rate indebtedness in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness would have impacted interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements during 
table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  we conduct a portion of our manufacturing and sales activity outside the united states  primarily in europe and canada 
in an effort to minimize foreign currency exchange risk  we have financed our acquisitions of white cap and cousins currie primarily with term loans borrowed under our credit agreement denominated in euros and canadian dollars  respectively 
our european operations include non euro denominated entities in turkey  poland and the united kingdom 
we also have operations in asia and south america that are not considered significant to our consolidated financial statements 
where available  we have borrowed funds in local currency or implemented certain internal hedging strategies to minimize our foreign currency risk related to foreign operations 
in addition  we are exposed to gains and losses from limited transactions of our operations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of such operations 
we have not utilized external derivative financial instruments to manage our foreign currency risk 
commodity pricing risk we purchase raw materials for our products such as metal and resins 
these raw materials are generally purchased pursuant to contracts or at market prices established with the vendor 
in general  we do not engage in hedging activities for these raw materials due to our ability to pass on price changes to our customers 
we also purchase commodities  such as natural gas and electricity  and are subject to risks on the pricing of these commodities 
in general  we purchase these commodities pursuant to contracts or at market prices 
we manage a portion of our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through natural gas swap agreements 
the natural gas swap agreements that we entered into for were not significant 
during  we entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
as of december   we had entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our expected exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
these agreements effectively convert pricing exposure for natural gas from market pricing to a fixed price 
you should also read notes and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the terms necessary to evaluate these transactions 
based on our natural gas usage in  a ten percent change in natural gas costs would have impacted our cost of goods sold by approximately million  after taking into account our natural gas swap agreements
