item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and risk factors contained in our sec filings 
overview we are a lodging focused real estate company that owns  as of february   twenty premium hotels and resorts that contain approximately  guestrooms 
we are committed to maximizing stockholder value through investing in premium full service hotels and  to a lesser extent  premium urban limited service hotels located throughout the united states 
our hotels are concentrated in key gateway cities and in destination resort locations and are all operated under a brand owned by one of the top three national brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton 
we are owners  as opposed to operators  of hotels 
as an owner  we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels  after we pay the hotel managers a fee based on the revenues and profitability of the hotels and reimburse all of their direct and indirect operating costs 
as an owner  we create value by acquiring the right hotels with the right brands in the right markets  prudently financing our hotels  thoughtfully re investing capital in our hotels  implementing profitable operating strategies  approving the annual operating and capital budgets for our hotels  closely monitoring the performance of our hotels  and deciding if and when to sell our hotels 
in addition  we are committed to enhancing the value of our operating platform by being open and transparent in our communications with investors  monitoring our corporate overhead and following corporate governance best practice 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors because of our adherence to three basic principles high quality urban and resort focused branded real estate  conservative capital structure  and thoughtful asset management 
high quality and resort focused branded real estate we own twenty premium hotels and resorts in north america 
these hotels and resorts are all categorized as upper upscale as defined by smith travel research and are generally located in high barrier to entry markets with multiple demand generators 
our properties are concentrated in five key gateway cities new york city  los angeles  chicago  boston and atlanta and in destination resorts such as the us virgin islands and vail  colorado 
we believe that gateway cities and destination resorts will achieve higher long term growth because they are attractive business and leisure destinations 
we also believe that these locations are better insulated from new supply due to relatively high barriers to entry and expensive construction costs 
we believe that the higher quality lodging assets create more dynamic cash flow growth and superior long term capital appreciation 
a core tenet of our strategy is to leverage national hotel brands 
we strongly believe in the value of powerful national brands because we believe that they are able to produce incremental revenue and profits compared to similar unbranded hotels 
in particular  we believe that branded hotels outperform unbranded hotels in an economic downturn 
dominant national hotel brands typically have very strong reservation and reward systems and sales organizations  and all of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the top three national brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton and all but two of the hotels are managed by the brand company directly 
generally  we are interested in owning only those hotels that are operated under a nationally recognized brand or acquiring hotels that can be converted into a nationally branded hotel 
conservative capital structure since our formation in  we have been consistently committed to a conservative and flexible capital structure with prudent leverage levels 
during though early  we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by fixing our interest rates for an extended period of time 
moreover  during the recent peak in commercial real estate market  we maintained low financial leverage by funding the majority of our acquisitions through the issuance of equity 
this strategy allowed us to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a moderate amount of debt 
during the peak years  we believed  and present events have confirmed  that it would be inappropriate to increase the inherent risk of a highly cyclical business through a highly levered capital structure 
the current economic environment has confirmed the merits of our conservative financing strategy 
we maintain a reasonable amount of inexpensive fixed interest rate mortgage debt with limited near term maturities 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  which consists of million outstanding on our senior unsecured credit facility and million of mortgage debt 
we currently have eight hotels  with an aggregate historic cost of billion  which are unencumbered by mortgage debt 
as of december   our debt has a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average maturity date of years 
in addition  of our debt is fixed rate and over of it matures in or later 
we expect that we will be able to either refinance or repay the million of debt coming due in and with a combination of cash on hand  proceeds from refinancing the mortgage debt on the existing mortgaged hotels or incurring new mortgage debt on one or more of our unencumbered hotels 
if efficient mortgage debt is unavailable  we have the ability to repay such debt with drawings under our million senior unsecured credit facility  which had over million available as of december  we may also consider raising equity capital to repay such debt 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
during the current recession  our corporate goals and objectives are focused on preserving and enhancing our liquidity 
while there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish all or any of these steps  we have taken  or are evaluating  a number of steps to achieve these goals  as follows we chose to not pay a fourth quarter dividend and we intend to pay our next dividend to our stockholders of record as of december  we expect the dividend will be in an amount equal to of our taxable income 
we are assessing whether to utilize the internal revenue service s revenue procedure in order to pay a portion of our dividend in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash 
we also have significantly curtailed capital spending for and expect to fund less than million in capital expenditures in  compared to an average of million per year of owner funded capital expenditures during  and we are considering the sale of one or more of our hotels 
we may issue common stock 
we have amended our senior unsecured credit facility to reduce the risk of default under one of our financial covenants 
we may seek further amendments to our credit facility to make additional changes to the financial covenants 
we have engaged mortgage brokers to determine potential options for additional property specific mortgage debt or the refinancing of our two mortgages that mature prior to january our current liquidity strategy is to take reasonable steps to further delever the company in the near term  focusing on reducing amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
if we achieve this goal  we believe that we will be uniquely positioned among lodging reits as we will have limited outstanding corporate debt and no preferred equity 
once we repay or refinance the million of mortgage debt coming due at the end of  we will have no property level debt maturing prior to in the longer term  we may use any accumulated cash to acquire hotels that fit our long term strategic goals or to repurchase shares of our common stock 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve any elements of our current liquidity strategy 
as of december   of our outstanding debt consisted of property specific mortgage debt 
all of such mortgage debt was borrowed by unique special purpose entities owned by us 
moreover  all of our property specific mortgage debt consists of single property mortgages that do not contain any cross default  financial covenants or general recourse provisions to any assets outside of the special purpose entities  including the company or our operating partnership 
only our credit facility includes a corporate guarantee or financial covenants  but the amount outstanding under our credit facility as of december  comprised less than of our outstanding debt 
as a result  in the event that the current recession becomes a more severe financial crisis  we generally expect to have the flexibility to isolate debt issues at any property without placing other assets in jeopardy 
thoughtful asset management we believe that we are able to create significant value in our portfolio by utilizing our management s extensive experience and our innovative asset management strategies 
our senior management team has an established broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships  including relationships with hotel owners  financiers  operators  project managers and contractors and other key industry participants 
in the current economic environment  we believe that our deep lodging experience  our network of industry relationships and our asset management strategies uniquely position us to minimize the impact of declining revenues on our hotels 
in particular  we are focused on controlling our property level and corporate expenses  as well as working closely with our managers to optimize the mix of business at our hotels to maximize potential revenue 
our property level cost containment includes the implementation of aggressive contingency plans at each of our hotels 
the contingency plans include controlling labor expenses eliminating of hotel staff positions  adjusting food and beverage outlet hours of operation and not filling open positions 
in addition  our strategy to significantly renovate nearly all of the hotels in our portfolio from to resulted in the flexibility to significantly curtail our planned capital expenditures for and even into we use our broad network to maximize the value of our hotels 
under the regulations governing reits  we are required to engage a hotel manager that is an eligible independent contractor through one of our subsidiaries to manage each of our hotels pursuant to a management agreement 
our philosophy is to negotiate management agreements that give us the right to exert significant influence over the management of our properties  annual budgets and all capital expenditures  and then to use those rights to continually monitor and improve the performance of our properties 
we cooperatively partner with the managers of our hotels in an attempt to increase operating results and long term asset values at our hotels 
in addition to working directly with the personnel at our hotels  our senior management team also has long standing professional relationships with our hotel managers senior executives  and we work directly with these senior executives to improve the performance of our portfolio 
we believe we can create significant value in our portfolio through innovative asset management strategies such as rebranding  renovating and repositioning 
we are committed to regularly evaluating our portfolio to determine if we can employ these value added strategies at our hotels 
during to we completed a significant amount of capital reinvestment in our hotels completing projects that ranged from room renovations  to a total renovation and repositioning of the hotel  to the addition of new meeting space  spa or restaurant repositioning 
in connection with our renovations and repositionings  our senior management team and our asset managers are individually committed to completing these renovations on time  on budget and with minimum disruption to our hotels 
as we have significantly renovated nearly all of the hotels in our portfolio  we have chosen to minimize capital expenditures beginning in key indicators of financial condition and operating performance we use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business 
these key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with gaap  as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  we use other information that may not be financial in nature  including statistical information and comparative data 
we use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels  groups of hotels and or our business as a whole 
we periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry wide information 
these key indicators include occupancy percentage  average daily rate or adr  revenue per available room or revpar  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or ebitda  and funds from operations or ffo 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance 
revpar  which is calculated as the product of adr and occupancy percentage  is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole 
we evaluate individual hotel revpar performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods  as well as on a company wide and regional basis 
adr and revpar include only room revenue 
room revenue comprised approximately of our total revenues for each of the years ended december  and and is dictated by demand  as measured by occupancy percentage  pricing  as measured by adr  and our available supply of hotel rooms 
our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth  personal income and corporate earnings  office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions  airport and other business and leisure travel  new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors 
in addition  our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotel managers and the brands we have licensed 
we also use ebitda and ffo as measures of the financial performance of our business

overview of results and outlook for after several years of above average growth in the lodging industry  the united states is now in a recession and the operating environment has become very challenging 
historically  economic indicators such as gdp growth  corporate earnings  consumer confidence and employment are highly correlated with lodging demand and each of these indicators dramatically deteriorated during the deterioration accelerated sharply in the fourth quarter of and we expect that such economic indicators will further weaken during as a result  our revenue declined in compared to and we currently expect that our hotel revenues will contract further during compared to  the peak year in the most recent lodging cycle  transient demand has noticeably declined  particularly among customers in the corporate and leisure segments that comprise approximately of our room sales 
the recession has resulted in reduced travel as well as a heightened focus on reducing the cost of travel 
during  the impact was primarily reflected in lower occupancy at our hotels  as the adr was flat compared to we expect a significant decline in both our adr and occupancy percentages in moreover  in an uncertain economy where consumers and corporations have a negative outlook  it is very difficult to accurately forecast the behavior of these individual travelers  beyond the obvious conclusion that lodging demand will decline in compared to we believe that a number of these individual travelers will continue to postpone or eliminate travel  or travel on a reduced budget  until consumer and business sentiment improves 
we are working closely with our hotel managers at our hotels to control our operating costs 
however  certain of our cost categories are increasing at a rate greater than the current rate of inflation  including wages  benefits  utilities and real estate taxes 
the combination of declining revenues and increasing operating costs will impact our operating results throughout in addition  certain of our markets will experience new hotel supply in  the most significant of which is in fort worth  texas  where we have one hotel 
we are also concerned with pressures from potential unionization at our hotels in light of the proposed employee free choice act 
as a result  we are increasing wages and benefits at certain of our hotels to decrease the likelihood of unionization 
although negative operating trends are likely to extend for some period of time  we expect operating results to improve when general economic conditions improve 
however  given the current financial markets crisis and general economic conditions  there can be no assurances that our operating results will not continue to decrease for the foreseeable future 
however  we believe that we are generally well positioned for the recession with a strong balance sheet

liquidity and capital resources the current recession and related financial crisis has resulted in deleveraging attempts throughout the global financial system 
as banks and other financial intermediaries reduce their leverage and incur losses on their existing portfolio of loans  the amount of capital that they are able to lend has materially decreased 
as a result  it is a very difficult borrowing environment for all borrowers  even those that have strong balance sheets 
while we have low leverage and a significant number of high quality unencumbered assets  we are uncertain if we could currently obtain new debt  or refinance existing debt  on reasonable terms in the current market 
owning full service urban and resort hotels is a capital intensive enterprise 
full service urban and resort hotels are expensive to acquire or build and require regular significant capital expenditures to satisfy guest expectations 
however  even with the current depressed cash flows  we project that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to pay for almost all of our liquidity and other capital needs over the medium term 
at present  we only project the need for additional capital to refinance or repay the million of debt that is maturing in december and january and for the acquisition of additional hotels or repurchase of additional shares of our common stock  should we decide to make either of those investments 
we currently expect that we will either be able to refinance the debt coming due at the end of or repay such debt with a draw on our existing credit facility or by incurring new mortgage debt on one or more of our unencumbered hotels 
we may also consider raising equity capital to repay such debt 
our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to fund future distributions to our stockholders to maintain our reit status as well as to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our hotels  including capital expenditures as well as payments of interest and principal 
we currently expect that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  short term borrowings under our credit facility 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotels  renovations  expansions and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotels  scheduled debt payments and making distributions to our stockholders 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  cash provided by operations and borrowings  as well as through the issuances of additional equity or debt securities 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current state of the overall credit markets  our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities is dependent upon  among other things  general market conditions for reits and market perceptions about us 
our financing strategy since our formation in  we have consistently committed to maintaining a conservative and flexible capital structure with prudent leverage levels 
during though early  we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by fixing our debt rates for an extended period of time 
moreover  during the recent peak in the commercial real estate market  we maintained low financial leverage by funding the majority of our acquisitions through the issuance of equity 
this strategy allowed us to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a moderate amount of debt 
during the peak years  we believed  and present events have confirmed  that it would be inappropriate to increase the inherent risk of a highly cyclical business through a highly levered capital structure 
we remain committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure with a low level of leverage that is predominately comprised of long term fixed rate debt 
however  we maintain the flexibility to modify these strategies if we believe fundamental changes have occurred in the capital or lodging markets 
as of december   our debt has a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average maturity date of years 
in addition  of our debt is fixed rate 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding 
two of our mortgages representing of our total outstanding debt will mature  one in december and the other in january we currently expect that we will either be able to refinance the debt coming due at the end of or repay such debt with a combination of cash on hand  a draw on our credit facility  and by incurring new mortgage debt on one or more of our unencumbered hotels or possibly the issuance of equity 
after these two mortgages mature  we do not have any significant mortgages that mature prior to our credit facility will expire in february  including a one year extension subject to our compliance with certain conditions 
we have a strong preference toward fixed rate long term limited recourse single property specific debt 
when possible and desirable  we will seek to replace short term sources of capital with long term financing 
in addition to property specific debt and our credit facility  we intend to use other financing methods as necessary  including obtaining from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  bridge loans  letters of credit  and other arrangements  any of which may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our investments 
in addition  we may issue publicly or privately placed debt instruments 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions and financings so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
during the current recession  our corporate goals and objectives are focused on preserving and enhancing our liquidity 
while there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish all or any of these steps  we have taken  or are evaluating  a number of steps to achieve these goals  as follows we chose to not pay a fourth quarter dividend and we intend to pay our next dividend to our stockholders of record as of december  the dividend will be in an amount equal to of our taxable income 
we are assessing whether to utilize the internal revenue service s revenue procedure in order to pay a portion of our dividend in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash 
we also have significantly curtailed all capital spending for and expect to fund less than million in capital expenditures in  compared to an average of million per year of owner funded capital expenditures during  and we are considering the sale of one or more of our hotels 
we may issue common stock 
we have amended our senior unsecured credit facility to reduce the risk of default under one of our financial covenants 
we may seek further amendments to our credit facility to make additional changes to the financial covenants 
we have engaged mortgage brokers to determine potential options for additional property specific mortgage debt or the refinancing of our two mortgages that mature prior to january our current liquidity strategy is to take reasonable steps to further delever the company in the near term  focusing on reducing amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
if we achieve this goal  we believe that we will be uniquely positioned among lodging reits as we will have limited outstanding corporate debt and no preferred equity 
once we repay or refinance the million of mortgage debt coming due at the end of  we will have no property level debt maturing prior to in the longer term  we may use any accumulated cash to acquire hotels that fit our long term strategic goals or to repurchase shares of our common stock 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve any elements of our current liquidity strategy 
share repurchase program on february   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had purchased the full million shares under the program at an average price of per share 
we retired all repurchased shares on their respective settlement dates 
credit facility we are party to a four year  million unsecured credit facility the facility expiring in february we may extend the maturity date of the facility for an additional year upon the payment of applicable fees and the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions 
interest is paid on the periodic advances under the facility at varying rates  based upon either libor or the alternate base rate  plus an agreed upon additional margin amount 
the interest rate depends upon our level of outstanding indebtedness in relation to the value of our assets from time to time  as follows leverage ratio or greater to to less than alternate base rate margin libor margin our facility contains various corporate financial covenants 
a summary of the most restrictive covenants is as follows actual at december  covenant maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio x x minimum tangible net worth million billion unhedged floating rate debt as a percentage of total indebtedness maximum leverage ratio is determined by dividing the total debt outstanding by the net asset value of our corporate assets and hotels 
hotel level net asset values are calculated based on the application of a contractual capitalization rate which range from to to the trailing twelve month hotel net operating income 
on december   we amended the facility to modify the fixed charge ratio covenant so that it is a trailing four consecutive quarter test  rather than a single quarter test 
tangible net worth is defined as the gross book value of our real estate assets and other corporate assets less our total debt and all other corporate liabilities 
our facility requires that we maintain a specific pool of unencumbered borrowing base properties 
the unencumbered borrowing base assets are subject to the following limitations and covenants actual at december  covenant minimum implied debt service ratio x x maximum unencumbered leverage ratio minimum number of unencumbered borrowing base properties minimum unencumbered borrowing base value million million percentage of total asset value owned by borrowers or guarantors if we were to default under any of the above covenants  we would be obligated to repay all amounts outstanding under our facility and our facility would terminate 
our ability to comply with two most restrictive financial covenants  the maximum leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio  depend primarily on our ebitda 
the following table shows the impact of various hypothetical scenarios on those two covenants

dividend policy we intend to distribute to our stockholders dividends equal to our reit taxable income so as to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on our earnings other than the earnings of our trs and trs lessees  which are all subject to tax at regular corporate rates and to qualify for the tax benefits afforded to reits under the code 
in order to qualify as a reit under the code  we generally must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction  plus of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the code  minus any excess non cash income 
we have paid quarterly cash dividends to common stockholders at the discretion of our board of directors 
we announced in december that we would not pay any further dividends in  and we intend to issue our next dividend to our stockholders of record as of december  the dividend will be an amount equal to of our taxable income 
also  we are assessing whether to utilize the internal revenue service s revenue procedure that permits us to pay a portion of that dividend in shares of common stock and the remainder in cash 
the following table sets forth the dividends on common shares for the years ended december   and dividend per payment date record date share april  march  june  june  september  september  january  december  april  march  june  june  september  september  january  december  april  march  june  june  september  september  capital expenditures the management and franchise agreements for each of our hotels provide for the establishment of separate property improvement funds to cover  among other things  the cost of replacing and repairing furniture and fixtures at our hotels 
contributions to the property improvement fund are calculated as a percentage of hotel revenues 
in addition  we may be required to pay for the cost of certain additional improvements that are not permitted to be funded from the property improvement fund under the applicable management or franchise agreement 
as of december   we have set aside million for capital projects in property improvement funds 
funds held in property improvement funds for one hotel are typically not permitted to be applied to any other property 
we believe that that ensuring that our hotels are fully renovated provides our hotels with competitive advantages over their direct competitors and helps us maximize cash flows from our hotels 
we have made significant capital investments in our hotels and now nearly all of our hotels are fully renovated 
as a result  we expect to significantly curtail our capital expenditures in and for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of capital improvements at our hotels  of which approximately was paid from corporate funds and the remainder from property improvement escrows 
the most significant projects are as follows chicago marriott downtown we completed a million renovation of the hotel 
approximately million was paid from corporate funds  with the balance coming from the hotel s property improvement escrow and a contribution from marriott international 
the project included a complete renovation of all the meeting and ballrooms  adding  square feet of new meeting space  reconcepting and relocating the restaurant  expanding the lobby bar and creating a marriott great room in the lobby 
the project began in the third quarter of and was substantially completed in april westin boston waterfront we completed the construction of additional meeting rooms in the building attached to the hotel in march the million project included the creation of over  square feet of meeting exhibit space 
the project began in the third quarter of and was substantially completed in the first quarter of conrad chicago we completed a renovation of the guestrooms and corridors during the first quarter and the front entrance repositioning in the third quarter of salt lake city in the fourth quarter of  we began a significant guestroom renovation at the hotel which was completed in january  almost all of which was funded by the hotel s property improvement escrow 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
non gaap financial measures we use the following two non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance ebitda and ffo 
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents net income loss excluding interest expense  provision for income taxes  including income taxes applicable to sale of assets  and depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
in addition  covenants included in our indebtedness use ebitda as a measure of financial compliance 
we also use ebitda as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions 
year ended december  in thousands net income interest expense income tax benefit expense real estate related depreciation and amortization ebitda amounts for the years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of income tax benefit included in discontinued operations 
amounts for the years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of depreciation expense included in discontinued operations 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which defines ffo as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that the presentation of ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non cash items  such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets 
we also use ffo as one measure in determining our results after taking into account the impact of our capital structure 
year ended december  in thousands net income real estate related depreciation and amortization gain on property transaction  net of taxes ffo amounts for the years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of depreciation expense included in discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the diamondrock hospitality company and all consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates investment in hotels 
acquired hotels  land improvements  building and furniture  fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
additions to property and equipment  including current buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings and land improvements and one to ten years for furniture and equipment 
identifiable intangible assets are typically related to contracts  including ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts 
contracts acquired that are at market do not have significant value 
we typically enter into a new hotel management agreement based on market terms at the time of acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data 
management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review our investments in hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments in hotels may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
revenue recognition 
hotel revenues  including room  golf  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation using the fair value based method of accounting described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
we record the cost of awards with service conditions based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
no awards with performance based or market based conditions have been issued 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted 
we have elected to be treated as a reit under the provisions of the internal revenue code and  as such  are not subject to federal income tax  provided we distribute all of our taxable income annually to our stockholders and comply with certain other requirements 
in addition to paying federal and state income tax on any retained income  we are subject to taxes on built in gains on sales of certain assets 
additionally  our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and foreign income tax 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality the operations of hotels historically have been seasonal depending on location  and accordingly  we expect some seasonality in our business 
historically  we have experienced approximately two thirds of our annual income in the second and fourth quarters 
new accounting pronouncements there are no new unimplemented accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
contractual obligations the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to the consolidated mortgage debt and other commitments of our operating partnership as of december  payments due by period less than to to total year years years after years in thousands long term debt obligations including interest operating lease obligations ground leases and office space total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business strategies  the primary market risk to which we are currently exposed  and  which we expect to be exposed in the future  is interest rate risk 
the face amount of our outstanding debt at december  was approximately million  of which million or was variable rate debt 
as of december   the fair value of the million of fixed rate debt was approximately million 
if market rates of interest were to increase by  or approximately basis points  the decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt would be million 
on the other hand  if market rates of interest were to decrease by one percentage point  or approximately basis points  the increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt would be million
