item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
reputation risk reputation risk arises from the possibility that negative publicity regarding the company s business practices  whether true or not  will cause a decline in its customer base or result in costly litigation 
in a service industry  such as the financial services industry  where product choices between companies are not always clearly distinguishable and which in many cases are interchangeable  a company s reputation for honesty  fair dealing and good corporate governance may be one of its most important assets 
loss of or damage to that reputation can have severe consequences 
additional risk factors there can be no assurance that the recently enacted legislation will help stabilize the us financial system 
on october   president bush signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of the esa 
the legislation was the result of a proposal by treasury secretary henry paulson to the us congress on september  in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions 
the us treasury and banking regulators are implementing a number of programs under this legislation to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual impact that the esa will have on the company  or on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of the esa to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of its common stock 
changes to the plan are presently under consideration by the new administration that may add to or change these provisions 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than months 
in recent weeks  the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  
table of contents there can be no assurance that amcore will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on the company s ability to access capital and on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
current market developments may adversely affect amcore s industry  business  financial condition and results of operations 
dramatic declines in the housing market during the prior year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers including other financial institutions 
the resulting lack of available credit  lack of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example market developments may affect borrower confidence levels  behaviors and financial condition  which could impact their borrowing and payment activities  and the company s ability to assess creditworthiness  which could impact lending activities  charge offs and provision for loan losses 
estimates of inherent losses in the loan portfolio rely on complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and may no longer be capable of accurate estimation 
the ability to borrow from other financial institutions or other funding transactions could be adversely affected 
amcore may be required to pay significantly higher federal deposit insurance corp 
fdic premiums due to depletion of the insurance fund  and a reduction of the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
increased regulation in the financial services industry  including as a result of the esa  could increase compliance costs and challenges  and limit the company s ability to pursue business opportunities 
industry competition could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect amcore 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose amcore to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty or client 
in addition  amcore s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan  investment or derivative exposure 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect amcore s financial condition and results of operations

item legal proceedings management believes that no litigation is threatened or pending in which the company faces a reasonable possibility of loss or exposure which will materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
since the company s subsidiaries act as depositories of funds  trustee and escrow agents  they occasionally are named as defendants in lawsuits involving claims to the ownership of funds in particular accounts 
the bank is also subject to counterclaims from defendants in connection with collection actions brought by the bank 
this and other litigation is incidental to the company s business 
during fourth quarter  as a member of the visa  inc organization visa  the company accrued a  liability for its proportionate share of various claims against visa 
this amount consisted of  of claims settled by visa but not yet paid  a  estimate of claims considered probable by visa pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
during first quarter  the company received a partial redemption distribution in connection with the initial public offering ipo of visa for which a million net security gain was recorded 
the gain included a partial reversal of litigation and guaranty losses described above to the extent they related to the company s share of ipo proceeds retained in escrow by visa to fund the losses 
the remaining contingent liability is  during fourth quarter  visa  inc reached a settlement in certain litigation with discover financial services discover 
the amount of the settlement with discover exceeded the amount retained in escrow by visa  inc from the proceeds of its ipo 
visa  inc 
issued sufficient escrowed stock to cover the additional reserve requirement  so no additional liability for this settlement was required to be accrued by the company 
the company has determined that its share of the additional reserve requirements to settle the litigation with discover is not material with respect to its consolidated financial statements as december  item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the significant factors affecting amcore financial  inc and subsidiaries amcore or the company consolidated financial condition as of december  compared to december   and the consolidated results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report 
factors influencing forward looking statements this report on form k contains  and periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission and written or oral statements made by the company s officers and directors to the press  potential investors  securities analysts and others will contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby with respect to  among other things  the financial condition  results of operations  plans  objectives  future performance and business of amcore 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based upon beliefs and assumptions of amcore s management and on information currently available to such management 
the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  should  may  will  or similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and amcore undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements in light of new information or future events 
contemplated  projected  forecasted or estimated results in such forward looking statements involve certain inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors many of which are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict could cause actual results to differ materially from those in its forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  the following possibilities i heightened competition  including specifically the intensification of price competition  the entry of new competitors and the formation of new products by new or existing competitors  ii adverse state  local and federal legislation and regulation or adverse findings or rulings made by local  state or federal regulators or agencies regarding amcore and its operations  iii failure to obtain new customers and retain existing customers  iv inability to carry out marketing and or expansion plans  v ability to attract and retain key executives or personnel  vi changes in interest rates including the effect of prepayments  vii general economic and business conditions which are less favorable than expected  viii equity and fixed income market fluctuations  ix unanticipated changes in industry trends  x unanticipated changes in credit quality and risk factors  xi success in gaining regulatory approvals when required  xii changes in federal reserve board monetary policies  xiii unexpected outcomes on existing or new litigation in which amcore  its subsidiaries  officers  directors or employees are named defendants  xiv technological changes  xv changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  xvi changes in assumptions or conditions affecting the application of critical accounting estimates  xvii inability of third party vendors to perform critical services for the company or its customers  xviii disruption of operations caused by the conversion and installation of data processing systems  xix adverse economic or business conditions affecting specific loan portfolio types in which the company has a concentration  such as construction  land development and other land loans  xx zoning restrictions or other limitations at the local level  which could prevent limited branch offices from transitioning to full service facilities  xxi possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and value of collateral and the possible impairment of collectibility of loans  xxii changes in lending terms to the company and the bank by the federal reserve  federal home loan bank  or any other regulatory agency or third party  and  xxiii the recently enacted emergency economic stabilization act of  and the various programs the us treasury and the banking regulators are implementing to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system  all of which may have significant effects on the company and the financial services industry  the exact nature and extent of which cannot be determined at this time 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and accounting changes critical accounting estimates the financial condition and results of operations for amcore presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below are discussions of those accounting policies that management believes require its most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain critical accounting estimates and are most important to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different portrayal of financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses loans  the company s largest income earning asset category  are periodically evaluated by management in order to establish an adequate allowance for loan losses allowance to absorb estimated losses that are probable as of the respective reporting date 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans where it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due principal or interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement impaired loans and statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience 
also included are other loss estimates that reflect the current credit environment and that are not otherwise captured in the historical loss rates 
these include the quality and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and economic and industry conditions  among other things 
the allowance is also subject to periodic examination by regulators  whose review may include their own assessment as to its adequacy to absorb probable losses 
additions to the allowance are charged against earnings for the period as a provision for loan losses provision 
conversely  this evaluation could result in a decrease in the allowance and provision 
actual loan losses are charged against and reduce the allowance when management believes that the collection of principal will not occur and the loss has been confirmed 
unpaid interest attributable to prior years for loans that are placed on non accrual status is also charged against and reduces the allowance 
unpaid interest for the current year for loans that are placed on non accrual status is charged against and reduces the interest income previously recognized 
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged to the allowance  if any  are credited to and increase the allowance 
those judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the initial and on going creditworthiness of the borrower  the amount and timing of future cash flows of the borrower that are available for repayment of the loan  the value and sufficiency of underlying collateral  the enforceability of third party guarantees  the frequency and subjectivity of loan reviews and risk grade changes  emerging or changing trends that might not be fully captured in the historical loss experience  and charges against the allowance for actual losses that are greater or less than previously estimated 
these judgments and assumptions are dependent upon or can be influenced by a variety of factors including the breadth and depth of experience of lending officers  credit administration and the corporate loan review staff that periodically review the status of the loan  changing economic and industry conditions  changes in the financial condition of the borrower and changes in the value and availability of the underlying collateral and guarantees 
while the company strives to timely reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the amount and timing of interest income and loan losses could be materially different 
these factors are most pronounced during economic downturns and may continue into an economic recovery  as specific credit performance may not be immediately affected by the stress of the 
table of contents downturn or the benefit of the recovery 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the amount and timing of losses on loans  it is difficult to predict with a high degree of certainty the effect to income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected the adequacy of the allowance by ten percent during  an additional provision of million may have been necessary

income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states and the states in which is conducts business 
these laws are complex and are subject to different interpretations by the company and the various taxing authorities that may result in certain uncertainties as to the final tax liability that is ultimately owed or refund that is due 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
that clarified the accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold that the company must evaluate before it can record the benefit of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
when making these evaluations  management must make judgments and estimates about the interpretation and application of these inherently complex and constantly changing tax statutes  related regulations and case law 
these judgments and interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 
as a result  the tax provision that is determined for a given period may subsequently be adjusted by amounts that may be material 
the company has no uncertain tax positions requiring an increase in its tax provision 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income and non deductible expenses 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
in addition to uncertainties that surround positions taken when preparing its tax return  the company must also evaluate the probability that it will ultimately realize the full value of its deferred tax asset 
the realization of the company s deferred tax asset over time is dependent upon the existence of taxable income in carryback periods or the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods 
when evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax asset  the company takes into account a number of factors including its taxable income during carryback periods  its recent earnings history  its expectations for earnings in the future  and the carryforward periods permitted by the various taxing jurisdiction 
to the extent full realizability is not probable a valuation allowance is required 
at december  the company had a valuation allowance of million due to the uncertain realization of certain state loss carryforwards

 which expresses the views of he sec regarding the use of a simplified method  as discussed in sab no 
 in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the sec concluded that a company could  under certain circumstances  continue to use the simplified method for share option grants after december  due to the significant differences in terms and types of option grants received by employees  and recent significant structural changes  historical exercise data did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term 
the company  therefore  continued its use of the simplified method for determining an estimate of expected term for its share options granted during

these were two office buildings  one small older branch in a historical market  one leased chicago suburban location with minimal retail activity that housed mainly commercial lenders  and a leased branch with excess capacity  minimal access to customers  and high maintenance costs 
a million non cash impairment charge was recorded in connection with the facilities consolidation 
one property was sold during at an amount equal to its book value  as recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
going forward  the company will continue its efforts to right size its cost structure to its revenue stream 
for example  the company will only hire for essential positions critical to operations 
capital and liquidity the company is actively pursuing opportunities to raise additional capital and otherwise enhance its capital position through a variety of means 
during fourth quarter  the company merged its investment management and trust group  into the main bank charter

reducing its non relationship accounts  while reaffirming and building upon its core customer relationships  is expected to build consistency across the company footprint 
developing deep and enduring customer relationships across all our lines of the business is a key objective 
the one bank initiative for serving customers across all lines of business continues to be a focus for it will allow the company to leverage the combined expertise of the organization and its people across the lines of business to better meet the customers financial needs  while enhancing the profitability of the company 
the company also focused on measuring line of business performance and closely aligning profitability with incentive compensation in order to drive strong core customer based growth

as part of this arrangement  the company sold the majority of its other mortgage servicing rights omsr portfolio the omsr sale in which it recorded a million gain the omsr gain 
the arrangement offers amcore a greater breadth of products  more competitive pricing and greater processing efficiencies and is expected to better position the company for future loan origination growth 
as a result of this arrangement  amcore expects to better control the risks associated with its mortgage banking business 

table of contents additionally  the cost structure in the mortgage banking business has become almost entirely variable in nature  allowing the company to better absorb fluctuations in mortgage volumes 
these include the costs of originating loans that are netted against mortgage banking income or interest income  as well as processing and servicing costs of loans retained in the bank s portfolio and that are a component of operating expenses

recent market and legislative developments the global and us economies continue to experience significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system during the past year and a half 
dramatic declines in the housing market  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
the availability of credit  confidence in the financial sector  and level of volatility in the financial markets have been significantly adversely affected as a result 
volatility and disruption 
table of contents in the capital and credit markets has reached unprecedented levels 
in many cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  subsequent to the end of third quarter  congress enacted and the president signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of esa 
shortly thereafter  the federal banking agencies announced the troubled asset relief program tarp and capital purchase program cpp 
collectively  these actions provided a variety of programs that financial institutions could participate in  including the potential sale of certain troubled loans to the united states government  sale of preferred stock to the united states treasury and temporary expansion of fdic insured deposit levels some voluntary and some automatic 
these programs continue to evolve as the administration strives to keep pace with rapidly changing economic conditions 
amcore continues to review these programs for their potential to add value to its customers and business and the potential impact of the esa or related programs on its future financial position  results of operation  cash flows or liquidity 
it is not yet clear what impact the esa  tarp  including the cpp  the temporary fdic guarantee expansion and other liquidity and funding initiatives of the federal reserve board fed and other agencies  and any additional programs that may be initiated in the future  will ultimately have on the financial markets and the other difficulties described above  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced  or on the us banking and financial industries and the broader us and global economies 
impact of inflation apart from operating expenses  the financial services industry is not directly affected by inflation  however  as the fed monitors economic trends and developments  it may change monetary policy in response to economic changes which would have an influence on interest rates

conversely  items that are not deductible for tax purposes  such as goodwill  while generally resulting in an effective tax rate that is higher than the statutory tax rate  have the opposite effect in a period where there is a loss before income taxes 
the combined effect of these factors was an effective tax rate that was lower than the statutory tax rate in  but higher than the statutory tax rate in earnings review of consolidated statements of operations the following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years 
net interest income net interest income is the company s largest source of revenue and represents the difference between income earned on loans and investments interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and 
table of contents borrowed funds interest bearing liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially affect the level of net interest income 
because the interest that is earned on certain loans and investment securities is not subject to federal income tax  and in order to facilitate comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt interest earning assets  the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent  or fte basis 
the fte adjustment was calculated using amcore s statutory federal income tax rate of 
net interest spread is the difference between the average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
since a portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits  other liabilities and stockholders equity  the effective interest rate incurred for all funding sources is lower than the interest rate incurred on interest bearing liabilities alone 
overview net interest income  on an fte basis  declined million or in and declined million or in the decline in was primarily due to a basis point decline in net interest spread and a decrease in average loan volumes 
the decline in was primarily the result of a decrease in average investment security balances and a seven basis point decline in net interest spread 
years ended december  dollars in thousands interest income book basis fte adjustment interest income fte basis interest expense net interest income fte basis net interest spread net interest margin net interest spread and margin see table net interest spread declined basis points to in from in  and decreased six basis points in from the level of 
the net interest margin was in  a decline of basis points from in the level was a decrease of three basis points from in the declines in net interest spread and net interest margin were driven by increased levels of non accrual loans  the reversal of accrued interest on loans placed on non accrual status  declines in average bank issued deposit funding replaced with higher cost wholesale funding sources  and continued divergence in recent financial markets with higher declines in prime rates compared to libor based rates 
the decline in loan yields were not matched by a corresponding decline in funding rates  as deposits and wholesale funding sources did not reprice as rapidly as loans  while some transactional deposit products have already reached a rate floor  where further reductions in rates paid are not possible 
in addition  continued offers by competitors to pay well above the wholesale cost of funds  and the bank s need to attract deposits in the current liquidity stressed environment  continue to place pressure on deposit rates 
other factors contributing to the decline in margin and spread was lower average yields on loans  reflecting declining interest rates  and the substitution of debt for capital in the repurchase program 
since the company has a higher proportion of prime based loans and a higher proportion of libor based liabilities  the aforementioned divergence in interest rates resulted in some reduction in net interest spread and net interest margin 
while the repurchase program initially improved the efficiency of the company s capital structure  it has also contributed to the compression in net interest spread and net interest margin 
changes due to volume see table  continued in  net interest income fte declined due to average volume by million when compared to this decline was comprised of a million decline in interest 
table of contents income that was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the decline in interest income was attributable to a million decrease in average loans  which included the loan sale 
the decrease in average loans came from a combined decrease of million in commercial real estate and commercial loans 
average residential real estate loans decreased million  while average consumer loan balances increased million 
average interest bearing liabilities declined million 
this was comprised of a million decrease in average interest bearing bank issued deposits and a million increase in average wholesale funding 
average interest bearing liabilities did not decrease as much as average interest earning assets due to losses and declines in non interest bearing liabilities of million 
in  net interest income fte declined due to average volume by million when compared to this decline was comprised of a million decline in interest income that was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the decline in interest income was attributable to a million decrease in interest earning assets 
the decrease was primarily driven by a million or reduction in average investment securities that was partially offset by a million or increase in average loans 
the growth in average loans came from a combined increase of million in commercial real estate and commercial loans 
average residential real estate loans increased million  while average consumer loan balances declined million 
average interest bearing liabilities declined million 
this was comprised of a million decrease in average bank issued deposits and million decrease in average wholesale funding 
average interest bearing liabilities did not decrease as much as average interest earning assets due to the repurchase program  which substituted debt for capital 
changes due to rate see table  continued in  net interest income fte declined due to average rates by million when compared with this was comprised of a million decrease in interest income that was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
both interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability costs were affected by seven separate decreases in the federal funds fed funds rate totaling a combined basis points that occurred during in addition  non performing loans increased from million at december  to million as of december  the bank must continue to fund these non earning loans until they are resolved 
the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to during  compared to in during this same period of time  the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points  to from 
in  net interest income fte declined due to average rates by million when compared with this was comprised of a million increase in interest income that was more than offset by a million increase in interest expense 
both interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability costs were affected by four basis point increases in the fed funds rate that occurred during the first two quarters of  which were followed by a basis point and two basis point decreases in late the yield on average earning assets increased basis points to during  compared to in during this same period of time  the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points  to from 
interest rate risk like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
among those factors that could further affect net interest margin and net interest spread include greater and more frequent changes in interest rates  including the impact of basis risk between various interest rate indices such as prime and libor as is the case with a significant divergence in current market rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  mismatch in the duration of interest earning assets and the interest bearing liabilities that fund them  the effect of prepayments or renegotiated rates  increased price competition on both deposits and loans  promotional pricing on deposits  short term liquidity needs that could drive up the cost of attracting new funding  changes in the mix of earning assets and the mix of liabilities  including greater or less use of wholesale sources  changes in the level of non accrual loans  and in an environment where there are rapid and substantial declines in interest rates  the limited ability to reduce certain low cost deposit product rates such as now accounts to the same extent that interest earning assets reprice 
as the increased level of non accrual loans will take time to work out  and there are no immediate signs of funding pressures waning  the company does not expect a recovery in the margin or spread statistics for several quarters 

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision see critical accounting estimates discussion was million  an increase of million from million in the increase was driven by million in net charge offs and by a million increase in non performing loans during net charge offs were million or basis points of average loans in  compared to million or basis points of average loans in non performing loans were million at december  compared to million at december  non performing loans is the sum of non accrual loans and loans that are ninety days past due but are still accruing interest 
delinquencies  loans that are thirty to ninety days past due  have also increased from million at december  to million as of december  the level of net charge offs  non performing loans and delinquent loans is largely due to the rapid deterioration in real estate markets that has occurred across the country 
in the midwest  where the company has its footprint  the result has been declines in real estate sales activity that negatively affects the liquidity and capital resources of borrowers  which in turn negatively affects the borrower s ability to make principal and interest payments when due 
the decline in sales activity also leads to eroding property values  which serve as collateral for the repayment of loans 
these circumstances are particularly evident for developers of residential real estate properties  where the company has a large concentration in loans outstanding of million 
developers use loan proceeds to fund the acquisition of land  development of the raw land  and construction of homes 
the vacant land component of this concentration was million 
these projects are heavily dependent upon the successful sale of units completed early in the project s life to fund units scheduled later in the project and then have the sales proceeds from those later units repay the loans 
these market conditions are expected to persist into the provision was million  an increase of million or from million in the increase was primarily due to a increase in net charge offs and a increase in non performing loans in compared to that were driven by a general weakening of real estate conditions in the company s markets 
net charge offs were million or basis points of average loans in  compared to million or basis points of average loans in non performing loans were million at december  compared to million at december  non interest income total non interest income is comprised primarily of fee based revenues from bank related service charges on deposits and investment management and trust

at december  and  total assets under administration were billion and billion  respectively 
service charges on deposits service charges on deposits  the company s largest source of non interest income  totaled million in  a million or increase over million in this follows a increase of million or from million in service charges on commercial deposit accounts were the primary driver as declining interest rates reduced the deposit credit offset against commercial account activity fees 
service charges on consumer deposits also increased due to enhancements to the company s fee structure and waiver policies 
this pace of growth is not expected to continue  however  the current level of revenue is expected to be sustainable 
mortgage banking income mortgage banking income includes fees generated from the underwriting  originating and servicing of mortgage loans along with gains and fees realized from the sale of these loans  net of origination costs  omsr amortization and impairment 
for  mortgage banking income was million  a decline of million from million in and was due to lower overall closed loan volumes and a higher proportion or refinanced volumes relative to new purchase volumes 
total closings were million in compared to million in new purchase mortgage closings were million or of total closings in  compared to million or of total closings in for  mortgage banking income was million  a decline of million from million in total closings were million in compared to million in new purchase mortgage closings were million or of total closings in  compared to million or of total closings in the decline in mortgage banking income was primarily due to lower servicing fee income and reduced sales volume due to slowdown in the housing markets that affected new purchase closings and higher mortgage interest rates that affected refinancing volumes 
the decline in servicing fee income for was attributable to the omsr sale  after which the company no longer generates significant fee income in connection with the servicing of mortgage loans sold to the secondary market 
the cost of servicing those loans  a component of operating expense  was also eliminated after the transition 
the company recorded the million omsr gain during the omsr gain is included in other non interest income 
see significant transactions  discussed above  for additional information 
coli income coli income totaled million in  a million or decline from million in the decline was due to the decline in market interest rates and negative mark to market adjustments on underlying investments

other income declined due to the million omsr gain  lower customer service income and higher derivative mark to market losses 
the derivative losses relate to economic hedges of various loan  deposit and coli products that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
for  these categories of other non interest income totaled million  a million or decline from the decline was primarily due to million of net security losses in  compared to net security gains of million in the loss was mainly due to the sale of approximately million of bonds purchased in and in order to reduce longer term interest rate and liquidity risk 
the proceeds of the sales were reinvested in shorter term securities that enabled the company to improve the repricing match of its assets and liabilities 
the million omsr gain and an increase in brokerage commission income were offset by lower cra related fund income and increased derivative mark to market losses year over year 
operating expenses overview in  total operating expense was million  an increase of million or four percent increase from million in a million goodwill charge  a million increase in provision for unfunded commitment losses  a million increase in loan collection costs  a million increase in fdic insurance costs  a million increase in net occupancy expense  and the million facilities consolidation impairment charge see cost efficiencies  discussed above were partially offset by a million decline in personnel costs  million in various other expenses  a million extinguishment loss incurred in see significant transactions  discussed above and million decline in advertising and business development costs 
in  total operating expense was million  which was essentially flat with million in increased net occupancy expense  higher foreclosure related costs and increased fraud losses were offset by lower compensation expense  advertising business development costs and professional fees 
the million extinguishment loss incurred in  offset a million loss on the extinguishment of federal home loan bank fhlb debt that was incurred in the efficiency ratio was in  compared to in and in the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenues 
revenues are the sum of net interest income and non interest income 
personnel expense personnel expense includes compensation expense and employee benefits and is the largest component of operating expenses  totaling a combined million in  million in and million in for  personnel expenses declined million or six percent compared to and decreased million or three percent in compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower salary and benefits 
this included more than an reduction in full time equivalent positions since the beginning of the decline was attributable to lower incentives and stock based compensation costs 
facilities expense facilities expense  which includes net occupancy expense and equipment expense  was a combined million in  million in and million in this was a million or seven percent increase in compared to  and an increase of million or in compared to the increase was due to higher rent expense  leasehold amortization and property taxes associated with branches that were not open at all or not open for the full period in the increase was primarily due to higher rental expense  real estate taxes  utility costs and snow removal expenses 
the increase in rental expense was associated with new branches that were opened in and that were open for only part of professional fees professional fees include legal  consulting  auditing and external portfolio management fees and totaled million in  million in and million in the decline in from relates to lower external assistance on regulatory compliance matters see regulatory developments discussion above 

table of contents loan related costs loan related costs include loan processing and collection expense and provision for unfunded commitment losses and totaled a combined million in  million in and million in while expenses in and were relatively stable  expenses increased million 
this was due to increased collection costs on higher non performing loan balances and estimated losses on letter of credit commitments on defaulted residential development loans 
goodwill impairment in second quarter  a million non cash charge was recorded that completely eliminated all goodwill previously carried on the company s balance sheet the goodwill charge 
the write off was due to the considerable and protracted discount of the company s stock value compared to its book value  which affected all business segments  as well as due to the decline in the operations of the company 
other operating expenses other operating expenses includes data processing expense  communication expense  advertising and business development expenses  insurance expense and other costs  and were a combined million in  million in and million in for  reductions in bankcard fees  fraud losses and various discretionary expenses such as travel  training and consumable stationary and supplies declined million  communication and advertising business development costs declined million and data processing costs declined million 
many of these reductions were related to the cost efficiencies key initiative 
these were partially offset by a million increase in insurance expense due to higher fdic insurance rates 
the fdic recently proposed a special assessment for all financial institutions whose deposits are federally insured  that if finalized would be imposed in and could be material in amount 
for  a million increase in fraud losses  a million increase in foreclosure related costs  and a million charge for the company s proportionate membership interest share of various litigation claims against visa  inc were offset by a million reduction in advertising business development costs 
income taxes income tax benefit totaled million in  compared to income tax expense of million and million in and  respectively 
declines in and were mainly due to losses and lower income before taxes  respectively 
the income tax expense was net of a  tax benefit associated with an increase in effective state income tax rates that were enacted during the year  and which increased the value of the company s recorded deferred income tax asset 
a deferred tax asset primarily represents expenses reflected on the company s consolidated statement of operations whose tax deduction has been delayed or deferred to a later year s tax return  due to differences in the timing of their recognition under generally accepted accounting principles versus income tax regulations 
since these deductions will be claimed in a future period  after the increase in the income tax rates becomes effective  they will result in a larger reduction in taxes paid than was previously recorded 
the effective tax rate was in  compared to in and in items that are exempt from taxes  such as municipal bond income and coli income  while generally resulting in an effective tax rate that is lower than the statutory tax rate  have the opposite effect in a period where there is a loss before income taxes 
conversely  items that are not deductible for tax purposes  such as goodwill  while generally resulting in an effective tax rate that is higher than the statutory tax rate  have the opposite effect in a period where there is a loss before income taxes 
the combined effect of these factors was an effective tax rate that was lower than the statutory tax rate in  but higher than the statutory tax rate in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents business segment review amcore s internal reporting and planning process focuses on four primary lines of business segment s commercial banking  retail banking  investment management and trust  and mortgage banking 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents a condensed income statement and total assets for each segment 
the financial information presented was derived from the company s internal profitability reporting system that is used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the company 
this information is based on internal management accounting policies which have been developed to reflect the underlying economics of the segments and  to the extent practicable  to portray each segment as if it operated on a stand alone basis 
thus  each segment  in addition to its direct revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  includes an allocation of shared support function expenses 
the commercial  retail and mortgage banking segments also include funds transfer adjustments to appropriately reflect the cost of funds on loans made and funding credits on deposits generated 
apart from these adjustments  the accounting policies used are similar to those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since there are no comprehensive standards for management accounting that are equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the information presented is not necessarily comparable with similar information from other financial institutions 
in addition  methodologies used to measure  assign and allocate certain items may change from time to time to reflect  among other things  accounting estimate refinements  changes in risk profiles  changes in customers or product lines  and changes in management structure 
for example  during  the company refined its method for measuring fund transfer adjustments to include non earning assets  liabilities  and equity  in addition to funds transfer adjustments for loans made and deposits generated 
the effect of this change for was to increase net interest income of the commercial banking and retail banking segments by million and million  respectively 
total segment results differ from consolidated results primarily due to inter segment eliminations  certain corporate administration costs  items not otherwise allocated in the management accounting process and treasury and investment activities such as the offset to the funds transfer adjustments made to the segments  interest income on the securities investment portfolio  gains and losses on the sale of securities  coli  cra related fund income and derivative gains and losses 
the impact of these items is aggregated to reconcile the amounts presented for the segments to the consolidated results and is included in the other column of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the federated and west banc transactions  the results of img for the current and prior periods are reported as discontinued operations 
goodwill write off totaling million is included in the other non interest expense line of the segment financials  and is further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
commercial banking the commercial banking segment commercial provides commercial banking services to middle market and small business customers through the bank s branch locations

commercial total assets were billion at december  and represented of total consolidated assets 
this compares to billion and at december  comparison of to commercial net loss for was million  a decline of million from net income of million 
the decline was due to a million increase in provision and a million decrease in net interest income that were partially offset by a million decrease in income taxes 

table of contents the decrease in net interest income was driven by increased levels of non accrual loans  decreased loan and deposit volumes and the reversal of accrued interest on loans placed on non accrual status 
the increase in provision was primarily due to deterioration of credit quality and increased volumes of non performing loans  particularly in the residential construction and development loans  which were affected by declining real estate sales activity  softening collateral values and large concentrations 
income taxes were lower due to a change from income before tax to a loss before tax

the decline was due to a million increase in provision and a million increase in non interest expense that were partially offset by an million increase in net interest income and a million decrease in income taxes 
in addition to the million effect of the change in funds transfer pricing noted above  the increase in net interest income was due to higher average loan volumes net of lower spreads 
the increase in provision was primarily due to increased net charge offs  delinquencies and non performing loans 
the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to higher facilities expense and allocated corporate support costs 
income taxes were lower due to a decline in income before tax 
retail banking the retail banking segment retail provides banking services to individual customers through the bank s branch locations

these were partly offset by a million increase in non interest income and an million decrease in income taxes 
the increase in provision was mainly due to higher net charge offs  including million in charge offs on two large home equity credits that were managed by retail 
the increase in operating expenses was largely due to a million goodwill write off  higher rental expense associated with new branches that were not yet open or not open for the entire period in  the effects of the facilities consolidation  and higher allocated expenses 
the increase in non interest income was mainly due to higher service charges on deposits  brokerage commission referral income and bankcard fee income

in addition to the million affect of the change in funds transfer pricing noted above  the increase in net interest income was primarily due to increased funding credits on deposit balances 
these were partially offset by higher interest expense due to rising short term interest rates 
the increase in non interest income was due to higher service charges on deposits  bankcard fees and customer service fees 
the decrease in provision was due to one large credit loss that occurred in the increase in non interest expense was due to higher facilities expense

there is an inverse relationship to changes in the fair value of the security with changes in interest rates  meaning that when rates increase the value of the security will decrease 
conversely  when rates decline the value of the security will increase 
credit risk arises from the extension of credit to a counter party  for example a purchase of corporate debt in security form  and the possibility that the counter party may not meet its contractual obligations 
the company s policy is to invest in securities with low credit risk  such as us treasuries  us government agencies such as the government national mortgage association or gnma  gses such as fhlmc and the federal national 
table of contents mortgage association or fnma  state and political obligations  and highly rated private issue mortgage and asset backed securities 
unlike agency debt  gse debt is not secured by the full faith and credit of the united states 
the combined effect of the company s gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses  net of tax  is included as other comprehensive income oci in stockholders equity  as none of the securities with gross unrealized losses are considered other than temporarily impaired 
of the million of gross unrealized losses  million relate to securities that have had a fair value less than book value for over twelve months 
included in the million of unrealized losses is million related to three aaa rated private issue mortgage related collateral mortgage obligations and million related to seven investment grade  private issue asset backed obligations 
these bonds have sufficient credit enhancement and the company expects full recovery of principal 
as of december   the company has the ability to hold  and has no intent to dispose of  the related securities until maturity or upon fair value exceeding cost 
for comparative purposes  at december   gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million were included in the securities available for sale portfolio

loans held for sale at december   mortgage origination fundings awaiting sale were million  compared to million at december  all loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
residential mortgage loans are originated by the company s mortgage banking segment 
prior to the mortgage restructuring in  the majority of non conforming adjustable rate  fixed rate and balloon residential mortgages were retained by the bank  while conforming adjustable rate  fixed rate and balloon residential mortgage loans were sold in the secondary market in order to minimize interest rate risk  as well as to generate gains on the sale of these loans and servicing income 
since the mortgage restructuring  a majority of all mortgage loans are sold for a fee net of origination costs

goodwill the company s goodwill balance of million was written off during deposits total deposits at december  were billion  a decrease of million or two percent when compared to the decrease was due to a million decrease in bank issued deposits net of a million increase in wholesale deposits 
the decline in bank issued deposits included a million decline in non interest bearing deposits and a million decline in non time interest bearing deposits 
these declines were partly offset by a million increase in time deposits 
the declines in non time deposits were largely attributable to institutional and other high balance deposits that exceeded historical fdic insurance limits that elected to diversify their 
table of contents coverage by moving deposits to other financial institutions 
in some instances  the deposit balances were collateralized and the decline freed up the collateral for other uses 
some large corporate deposits are now included in short term borrowings  as the customers have elected to participate in a repo sweep product 
balances in this product increased million since december  the increase in time deposits is attributable to deposit attraction strategies employed by the bank in recent months as well as growth in a product offered by the bank that enables customers to increase their fdic insured balances 
bank issued deposits represented of total deposits at december  compared to at december  table shows the maturity distribution of time deposits  and over 
borrowings borrowings totaled million at year end and were comprised of million of short term and million of long term borrowings

the derivatives used most often are interest rate swaps  and on occasion caps  collars and floors collectively the interest rate derivatives  mortgage loan commitments and forward contracts 
as of december  and  there were no caps  collars or floors outstanding 
interest rate derivatives are contracts with a third party the counter party to exchange interest payment streams based upon an assumed principal amount the notional principal amount 
the notional principal amount is not advanced to from the counter party 
it is used only as a reference point to calculate the exchange of interest payment streams and is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
amcore does not have any derivatives that are held or issued for trading purposes but it does have some derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
amcore monitors credit risk exposure to the counter parties 
all counter parties  or their parent company  have investment grade credit ratings and are expected to meet any outstanding interest payment obligations

loan commitments and letters of credit the company  as a provider of financial services  routinely enters into commitments to extend credit to its bank customers  including a variety of letters of credit 
letters of credit are a conditional but generally irrevocable form of guarantee on the part of the bank to make payments to a third party obligee  upon the default of payment or performance by the bank customer or upon consummation of the underlying transaction as intended 
while these represent a potential outlay by the company  a significant amount of the commitments and letters of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
commitments and letters of credit are subject to the same credit policies  underwriting standards and approval process as loans made by the company 
at both december  and december   liabilities in the amount of million  representing the value of the guarantee obligations associated with certain of the letters of credit  had been recorded in accordance

these investments are recorded at amortized historical cost or fair value  as applicable  with income recorded when dividends are declared 
other investments  comprised of various affordable housing tax credit projects ahtcp and other cra related investments  totaled approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
losses are limited to the remaining investment and there are no additional funding commitments on the ahtcps by the company 
those investments without guaranteed yields were reported on the equity method  while those with guaranteed yields were reported using the effective yield method 
the maximum exposure to loss for all non marketable equity investments is the sum of the carrying amounts plus additional commitments  if any  and the potential for the recapture of tax credits on ahtcp should it fail to qualify for the entire period required by tax regulations 
other investments the company also holds million in a common security investment in amcore capital trust ii the capital trust  to which the company has million in long term debt outstanding

swap contract payments relate only to the pay side of the transaction 
any contracts with floating rates were calculated using the rate in effect at december  asset quality review and credit risk management amcore s credit risk is centered in its loan portfolio  which totaled billion  or of earning assets  including coli on december  the objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to quantify and manage credit risk on a portfolio basis as well as reduce the risk of a loss resulting from a customer s failure to perform according to the terms of a transaction 
to achieve this objective  amcore strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type  industry concentration and borrower concentration 
the company is also exposed to carrier credit risk with respect to its million investment in coli 
amcore has managed this risk by utilizing separate accounts in which its credit exposure is to a specific investment portfolio rather than the carrier 
the underlying investment portfolios which are managed by parties other than amcore consist of investment grade securities and the investment guidelines typically have a requirement to sell if the securities are downgraded 
separate accounts constitute the majority of amcore s coli portfolio 
in terms of coli accounts where amcore is directly exposed to carrier risk  this risk has been managed by diversifying its holdings among multiple carriers and by periodic internal credit reviews 
all carriers have investment grade ratings from the major rating agencies 
allowance for loan losses the allowance is a significant estimate that is regularly reviewed by management to determine whether or not the amount is considered adequate to absorb inherent losses that are probable as of the reporting date 
if not  an additional provision is made to increase the allowance 
conversely  this review 
table of contents could result in a decrease in the allowance 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed impaired loans and statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience 
also included are other loss estimates  which reflect the current credit environment that are not otherwise captured in the historical loss rates 
the determination by management of the appropriate level of the allowance amounted to million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million or 
specific loss estimates on individually reviewed impaired loans and loss estimates on loan pools increased million and million  respectively  at december  compared to december  the increase in the allowance was taken in light of sustained increases in non performing loans  increased delinquencies  higher net charge offs and the rapid deterioration in real estate sales activity in the midwest that negatively affects the liquidity and capital resources of borrowers and the borrower s ability to make principal and interest payment when due 
the decline in sales activity also leads to eroding property values  which serve as collateral for the repayment of loans 
at december   the allowance as a percent of total loans and of non performing loans was and  respectively 
these compare to the same ratios at december  of and 
net charge offs were million in  an increase of million from million in this was and of average loans  respectively 
increases included commercial real estate net charge offs of million  commercial and industrial net charge offs of million  and million in consumer installment net charge offs 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  loans ninety days past due and still accruing interest  foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets 
non performing assets totaled million as of december   an increase of million from million at december  the increase since december  consisted of a million increase in non performing loans driven by a rapid weakening of real estate conditions in the company s markets 
these market conditions are expected to persist into foreclosed assets increased by million  as newly foreclosed loans exceeded liquidations of existing foreclosed assets 
total non performing assets represented and of total assets at december  and december   respectively 
while the company strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluation  the ultimate loss could differ materially from the current estimate 
see critical accounting estimates for a discussion of the judgments and assumptions that are most critical in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
in addition to the amount of non accruing and delinquent loans over ninety days past due  management is aware that other possible credit problems of borrowers may exist 
these include loans that are migrating from grades with lower risk of loss probabilities into grades with higher risk of loss probabilities  as performance and potential repayment issues surface 
the company monitors these loans and adjusts its historical loss rates in its allowance evaluation accordingly 
the most severe of these are credits that are classified as substandard assets due to either less than satisfactory performance history  lack of borrower s sound worth or paying capacity  or inadequate collateral 
as of december  and december   there were million and million  respectively  in this risk category that were to days delinquent and million and million  respectively  that were to days past due 
at december   of these loans were current or less than thirty days past due 
concentration of credit risks as previously discussed  amcore strives to maintain a diverse loan portfolio in an effort to minimize the effect of credit risk 
summarized below are the characteristics of classifications that exceed of total loans 
commercial  financial  and agricultural loans were million at december   and comprised of gross loans  of which were non performing 
net charge offs of commercial loans in and were and  respectively  of the average balance of the category 

table of contents commercial real estate and construction loans were billion at december   comprising of gross loans  of which were classified as non performing

residential real estate loans  which include home equity and permanent residential financing  totaled million at december   and represented of gross loans  of which were non performing 
net charge offs of residential real estate during and were and  respectively  of the average balance in this category 
the increases in net charge offs reflect credit conditions in general and the chargedown of two larger credits 
the bank does not engage in sub prime lending 
installment and consumer loans were million at december   and comprised of gross loans  of which were non performing 
net charge offs of consumer loans during and were and  respectively  of the average balance of the category 
consumer loans are comprised primarily of in market indirect auto loans and direct installment loans 
indirect auto loans totaled million at december  both direct loans and indirect auto loans are approved and funded through a centralized department utilizing the same credit scoring system to provide a standard methodology for the extension of consumer credit 
contained within the concentrations described above  the company has billion of interest only loans  of which million are included in the construction and commercial real estate loan category  million are included in the commercial  financial  and agricultural loan category  and million are in home equity loans and lines of credit 
the company does not have any negative amortization loans  and does not have material concentrations in relation to its total portfolio of high loan to value loans  option adjustable rate mortgage loans or loans that initially have below market rates that significantly increase after the initial period 
liquidity and capital management liquidity management overview liquidity management is the process by which the company  through its asset and liability committee alco and capital markets and treasury function  ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
liquidity is derived primarily from bank issued deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations  and access to other funding sources 
other funding sources include brokered cds  fed funds purchased lines  federal reserve bank discount window advances  tt l  taf borrowings  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  the sale or securitization of loans  subordinated debentures  balances maintained at correspondent banks and access to other capital market instruments 
bank issued deposits  which exclude wholesale deposits  are considered by management to be the primary  most stable and most cost effective source of funding and liquidity 
the bank also has capacity  over time  to place additional brokered cd s as a source of mid to long term funds 
the esa and related government programs may also be a source of potential liquidity 
amcore continues to review these programs for their potential to add value to its customers and business and has not determined their potential impact on its future financial position  results of operation  cash flows or liquidity 
uses of liquidity include funding credit obligations to borrowers  funding of mortgage originations pending sale  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due or called  maintaining adequate collateral for public deposits  paying dividends to shareholders  payment of operating expenses  funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 

table of contents during  wholesale funding  which includes borrowings and brokered deposits  increased million 
of this increase  million were the bank s customer sourced repo sweep product  which is a secured form of borrowing 
wholesale funding represented of total assets at december   compared to as of the end of the company s liquidity was considered adequate to meet its foreseeable needs as of december  investment securities portfolio scheduled maturities of the company s investment securities portfolio and the prepayment of mortgage and asset backed securities represent a significant source of liquidity 
approximately million  or nine percent  of the securities portfolio will contractually mature in see table this does not include mortgage and asset backed securities since their payment streams may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations  typically without penalty 
for example  scheduled maturities for  excluding mortgage and asset backed securities  were million  whereas actual proceeds from the portfolio  which included scheduled payments and prepayments of mortgage and asset backed securities  were million 
this compares to proceeds of million and million in and  respectively 
at december   securities available for sale were million or of total assets compared to million or at december  loans funding of loans is the most significant liquidity need  representing of total assets as of december  since december   loans decreased million 
loans held for sale  which represents mortgage origination funding awaiting sale  declined million 
the scheduled repayments and maturities of loans represent a substantial source of liquidity 
table shows  for selected loan categories  that million in maturities are scheduled for bank issued deposits bank issued deposits are the most cost effective and reliable source of liquidity for the company 
during  bank issued deposits declined million 
scheduled maturities of time deposits of  or more  as reflected in table  are million in  of which million are bank issued 
branch expansion the bank is slowing the opening of new branches to only those already in the construction pipeline or under contract 
except for loan growth  branch expansion is not expected to require a significant amount of liquidity 
parent company in addition to the overall liquidity needs of the company  the parent company requires adequate liquidity to pay its expenses  repay debt when due and pay stockholder dividends 
liquidity is primarily provided to the parent company through the bank in the form of dividends 
the bank is limited by regulation in the amount of dividends that it can pay  without prior regulatory approval 
in recent years  the company took steps to transfer excess liquidity to the parent company from the bank  with dividend payments of million and million  in and  respectively 
for  current bank earnings are not expected to be paid as dividends without prior regulatory approval 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other sources of liquidity as of december   other sources of potentially available liquidity included borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
the company also has capacity  over time  to place sufficient amounts of brokered cds as a source of mid to long term liquidity 
unfunded fed funds lines also provide a source of overnight liquidity 
the bank s indirect auto portfolio  which at december  was million  is a potential source of liquidity through future loans sales or securitizations 
the sale of preferred stock to the united states treasury and temporary expansion of fdic insured deposit levels pursuant to the cpp is also a potential source of liquidity that is being evaluated 
these potential sources are not committed lines  in that the availability and terms including advance rates on collateral can vary 
the recent trends have been for lower advance or lending rates on assets 

table of contents other uses of liquidity at december   other potential uses of liquidity totaled million and included million in commitments to extend credit  million in residential mortgage commitments primarily held for sale  and million in letters of credit 
at december   these amounts totaled billion 
the company entered into a stock redemption agreement redemption agreement on october   as amended june   pursuant to section of the internal revenue code to pay death taxes and other related expenses of certain stockholders 
such redemptions may be subject to bank regulatory agency approvals or limited by debt covenant restrictions 
the company s million credit facility is due april  capital management total stockholders equity at december  was million  a decrease of million from december  the decrease in stockholders equity was due to a million decrease in retained earnings and a million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of other increases in capital of million 
the million decrease in retained earnings was due to the million net loss and cash dividends paid of million 
in addition to the cash dividends  the company paid stock dividends in june and september equivalent to per share each

the book value per share decreased per share to at december   down from at december  amcore has outstanding million of capital securities through the capital trust 
of the million  million qualifies as tier capital for the company s regulatory capital purposes  which is the million reduced by the million of common equity securities owned by the company 
during  the company issued fixed floating rate junior subordinated debentures in the amount of million 
the debt qualifies as tier capital for bank and company regulatory capital purposes 
the bank has the capacity to issue  under regulatory guidelines  additional subordinated debt that would qualify as tier capital 

table of contents as the following table indicates  amcore s total risk based capital  tier capital and leverage ratio all exceeded the regulatory minimums of capital adequacy  as of december  there are five levels of capital defined by the regulations well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
as of december  the bank is considered well capitalized under this regulatory framework  the highest designation 
amcore  like many financial institutions have historically maintained capital at or above the well capitalized minimum 
also  like many financial institutions this year  amcore has experienced steady declines in its capital levels as credit losses have risen 
as noted previously  the company expects the credit crisis that is affecting the economy in general to persist into  and will likely bring with it additional credit losses 
if these expectations are realized  amcore may temporarily or otherwise fall below the well capitalized level during first quarter falling below well capitalized may potentially affect  among other things  changes in the company s borrowing costs and terms from regulatory authorities and other third parties  the bank s fdic deposit insurance premiums  and amcore s ability to access the brokered cd markets 
even so  the company expects to have sufficient liquidity to operate with these limitations 
amcore has simulated its capital levels under various stress scenarios and does not expect its capital level to fall below adequately capitalized  as defined by the regulations 
as noted previously under key initiatives  amcore is actively pursuing opportunities to raise additional capital and otherwise enhance its capital position through a variety of means 
the company is also discussing with its regulators  the regulatory standards notwithstanding  what an appropriate level of capital should be given the current credit environment and the bank s level of non performing loans 
such minimum levels may be at a level greater than the level required to be considered well capitalized under applicable regulations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of its normal operations  amcore is subject to interest rate risk on the assets it invests in primarily loans and securities and the liabilities it funds with primarily customer deposits  brokered deposits and borrowed funds  as well as its ability to manage such risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market values of amcore s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
while amcore manages other risks in its normal course of operations  such as credit and liquidity risk  it considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of amcore s business activities and operations 
in addition  since as of december  amcore did not hold a trading portfolio  it was not exposed to significant market risk from trading activities 
during  there were no material changes in amcore s primary market risk exposures 
based upon current expectations  no material changes are anticipated in the future in the types of market risks facing amcore 
like most financial institutions  amcore s net income can be significantly influenced by a variety of external factors  including overall economic conditions  policies and actions of regulatory authorities  the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities reprice  variances in prepayment of loans and securities other than those that are assumed  early withdrawal of deposits  exercise of call options on borrowings or securities  competition  a general rise or decline in interest rates  changes in the slope of the yield curve  changes in historical relationships between indices such as libor and prime and balance sheet growth or contraction 
amcore s asset and liability committee alco seeks to manage interest rate risk under a variety of rate environments by structuring the company s balance sheet and off balance sheet positions 
the risk is monitored and managed within approved policy limits 
the company utilizes simulation analysis to quantify the impact on income before income taxes under various rate scenarios 
specific cash flows  repricing characteristics  and embedded options of the assets and liabilities held by the company are incorporated into the simulation model 
earnings at risk is calculated by comparing the income before income taxes of a stable interest rate environment to the income before income taxes of a different interest rate environment in order to determine the percentage change 
the following table summarizes the affect on annual income before income taxes based upon an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve change in interest rates as of december  as of december  the amounts and assumptions used in the simulation model should not be viewed as indicative of expected actual results 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the above results do not take into account any management action to mitigate potential risk
