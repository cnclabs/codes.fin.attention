table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we own and or operate radio stations in markets that reach approximately of the us hispanic population 
in addition  we own and operate two television stations and have various affiliation and or programming agreements  which reach approximately million households throughout the us  including puerto rico 
the success of each of our stations depends significantly upon its audience ratings and share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
the broadcasting industry is a highly competitive business  but some barriers to entry do exist 
each of our stations competes with both spanish language and english language stations in its market  as well as with other advertising media  such as newspapers  cable television  the internet  magazines  outdoor advertising  satellite radio and television  transit advertising and direct mail marketing 
factors which are material to our competitive position include management experience  our stations rank in their markets  signal strength and frequency  and audience demographics  including the nature of the spanish language market targeted by a particular station 
our primary source of revenue is the sale of advertising time on our stations to local and national advertisers 
our revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates that our stations are able to charge  as well as the overall demand for advertising time in each respective market 
seasonal net broadcasting revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to fluctuations in advertising demand from local and national advertisers 
typically for the broadcasting industry  the first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenue 
our most significant operating expenses are compensation expenses  programming expenses  professional fees  and advertising and promotional expenses 
our senior management strives to control these expenses  as well as other expenses  by working closely with local station management and others  including vendors 
our radio stations are located in six of the top ten hispanic markets of los angeles  new york  puerto rico  chicago  miami and san francisco 
los angeles and new york have the largest and second largest hispanic populations  and are also the largest and second largest radio markets in the united states in terms of advertising revenue  respectively 
we format the programming of each of our radio stations to capture a substantial share of the us hispanic audience in their respective markets 
the us hispanic population is diverse  consisting of numerous identifiable groups from many different countries of origin and each with its own musical and cultural heritage 
the music  culture  customs and spanish dialects vary from one radio market to another 
we strive to maintain familiarity with the musical tastes and preferences of each of the various hispanic ethnic groups and customize our programming to match the local preferences of our target demographic audience in each market we serve 
our radio revenue is generated primarily from the sale of local and national advertising 
our television stations and related affiliates operate under the megatv brand 
we have created a unique television format which focuses on entertainment  events and variety with high quality production 
our programming is formatted to capture shares of the us hispanic audience by focusing on our core strengths as an entertainment company  thus offering a new alternative compared to the traditional latino channels 
megatv s programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs  ranging from televised radio branded shows to general entertainment programs  such as music  celebrity  debate  interviews and personality based shows 
as part of our strategy  we have incorporated certain of our on air personalities into our programming  as well as including interactive elements to complement our internet websites 
we develop and produce more than of our programming and obtain other content from spanish language production partners 
our television revenue is generated primarily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming 
as part of our operating business  we also operate lamusica 
com  mega 
tv  and our radio station websites which are bilingual spanish english websites providing content related to latin music  entertainment  news and culture 
lamusica 
com and our network of station websites generate revenue primarily from advertising and sponsorship 
in addition  the majority of our station websites simultaneously stream our stations content  which has broadened the audience reach of our radio stations 
we also occasionally produce live concerts and events throughout the united states  including puerto rico

table of contents the following summary table presents a comparison of our operating results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and various fluctuations illustrated in the table are discussed below

table of contents net revenue the decrease in our consolidated net revenue of million or was due to the decrease in net revenue from our radio segment of million or  offset by an increase in our television segment net revenue of million or 
our radio segment had a decrease in net revenue primarily due to lower local and national sales caused mainly by the decline in economic conditions 
the decrease in local sales occurred in all of our markets  excluding an increase in our puerto rico market 
the decrease in national sales occurred in all of our markets 
our television segment continues to increase its advertising and content demand as our megatv content continues to increase its viewership 
our television segment net revenue growth was primarily due to the increases in local spot sales  subscriber revenue related to the directv affiliation agreements  national sales  barter sales  and sponsorship sales 
engineering and programming expenses the increase in our consolidated engineering and programming expenses of million or was due to increases in both our television and radio segments 
our television segment expenses increased million or  primarily due to increases in a original produced programming  b acquired programming licenses  and c fiber link and transmitter line charges related to the expansion of megatv outlets 
our radio segment expenses increased million or  primarily related to increases in a compensation and benefits for our radio programming personnel related to new morning shows in our puerto rico  chicago and miami markets  b costs related to the amigo broadcasting litigation settlement  c music license fees  and d transmitter lines  rent and electricity expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses of million or was due to a decrease in our radio segment 
our radio segment expenses decreased million or  primarily due to a decrease in advertising  promotional and marketing costs  sales commissions  taxes and licenses  and the allowance for doubtful account provision 
our television segment expenses increased million or  primarily due to an increase in advertising  promotional and marketing costs related to new shows  barter expense and professional fees 
corporate expenses the decrease in corporate expenses was primarily a result of a decrease in employee compensation 
depreciation and amortization the increase in our consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses is directly related to the increase in capital expenditures throughout our company  but mainly in our television segment 
impairment of fcc broadcasting licenses and restructuring costs as a result of our sfas no 
impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill  we recorded non cash impairment losses of approximately million related to the fcc broadcasting licenses for certain individual stations in all of our markets 
the impairment loss was due to changes in estimates and assumptions which were primarily a decreased advertising revenue growth projections in our respective markets  and b increased risk adjusted discount rates used in fair value determinations 
also  the current decline in cash flow multiples for recent station sales were considered in the estimates and assumptions used 
as a result of the decrease in the demand for advertising and the continued deterioration of the economy  we began to implement a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year to reduce expenses throughout the company and have incurred costs totaling million in related to the termination of various programming contracts and personnel 
in addition  we are reviewing other cost cutting measures  as we continue to evaluate the scope and duration of the current economic slowdown and its anticipated impact on our operations 

table of contents operating income the decrease in operating loss income was mainly due to the impairment of fcc broadcasting licenses and restructuring costs of million 
also contributing to the decrease in operating loss income was a decrease in our radio segment s net revenue and an increase in our television segment s operating expenses 
interest expense  net the increase in interest expense  net  mainly was due to a decrease in interest income  resulting from a general decline in interest rates on our lower cash balances 
change in fair value of derivative instrument in september and october  the counterparty to one of our interest rate swaps  lehman brothers special financing inc  and its parent and credit support provider  lehman brothers holdings inc  each filed for bankruptcy 
based on these bankruptcy filings  this cash flow hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting 
therefore  the change in fair value from september   the last time this hedge was determined to be effective  to december   was million  which was recorded in earnings as a change in fair value of derivative instrument 
income taxes the income tax benefit of million arose primarily from the impact of the reduction of our deferred tax liabilities related to the impairment of our fcc broadcasting licenses of approximately million  offset by income tax expense resulting from the tax amortization of our fcc broadcasting licenses 
net income the decrease in net loss income was primarily due to the decrease in operating loss income related primarily to the decrease in net revenue and the impairment of fcc broadcasting licenses and restructuring costs  partially offset by the related income tax benefit 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand million as of december   cash expected to be provided by operations and  if available and funded  any additional proceeds from our existing revolving credit facility 
our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as  overall advertising demand  shifts in population  station listenership and viewership  demographics  audience tastes and fluctuations in preferred advertising media 
our ability to raise funds by increasing our indebtedness is limited by the terms of the certificates of designation governing our series b preferred stock and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility 
additionally  our certificates of designations and credit agreement each place restrictions on us with respect to the sale of assets  liens  investments  dividends  debt repayments  capital expenditures  transactions with affiliates and consolidations and mergers  among other things 
management continually projects anticipated cash requirements and believes that cash from operating activities  together with cash on hand  should be sufficient to permit us to meet our operating obligations in the foreseeable future  including  among other things  required quarterly interest and principal payments pursuant to the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facility due  quarterly cash dividend payments pursuant to the certificates of designation governing our series b preferred stock  and capital expenditures  excluding the acquisitions of fcc licenses 
while not significant to us to date  the disruptions in the capital and credit markets may result in increased borrowing costs associated with our short term and long term debt 
assumptions none of which can be assured which underlie management s beliefs  include the following the demand for advertising within the broadcasting industry and economic conditions in general will not continue to deteriorate further in any material respect  we will continue to successfully implement our business strategy  and we will not incur any material unforeseen liabilities  including but not limited to taxes  environmental liabilities  regulatory matters and legal judgments 
as a result of the decrease in the demand for advertising and the continued deterioration of the economy  we began to implement a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year to reduce expenses throughout the company and have incurred costs totaling million in related to the termination of various programming contracts and personnel 
in addition  we are reviewing other cost cutting measures  as we continue to evaluate the scope and duration of the current economic slowdown and its continued impact on our operations 
our strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations 

table of contents we continuously evaluate opportunities to make strategic acquisitions and or dispositions  primarily in the largest hispanic markets in the united states 
we engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and or dispositions from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions would be financed through funds generated from permitted debt financing  equity financing  operations  asset sales or a combination of these or other available sources 
however  there can be no assurance that financing from any of these sources  if necessary and available  can be obtained on favorable terms for future acquisitions 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our capital resources for the fiscal years ended december  and  with respect to certain of our key measures affecting our liquidity 
the changes set forth in the table are discussed below 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
change in thousands capital expenditures radio television corporate consolidated net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents capital expenditures the increase in our capital expenditures is a result of various capital projects  including but not limited to the build out and furnishing of the sbs miami broadcast center that was completed in for the fiscal year  we are estimating a significant decrease in our capital expenditures  which are projected to be in the range of million to million 
net cash flows provided by operating activities changes in our net cash flows from operating activities were primarily a result of the decrease in cash sales and an increase in cash paid to vendors 
net cash flows used in investing activities changes in our net cash flows from investing activities were primarily a result of the following in a we completed the improvements to the sbs miami broadcast center which was purchased in  these building improvements totaled million and b other capital expenditures totaled million which were mainly for equipment and furniture for the sbs miami broadcast center 
net cash flows used in financing activities changes in our net cash flows from financing activities were primarily a result of the repayment of the non interest bearing promissory note totaling approximately million  which was offset by the proceeds of million related to the draw down of our senior credit facility revolver and a decrease of million of cash dividends paid on the series b preferred stock 

table of contents recent developments restructuring costs as a result of the decrease in the demand for advertising and the continued deterioration of the economy  we began to implement a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year to reduce expenses throughout the company and have incurred costs totaling million in related to the termination of various programming contracts and personnel 
in addition  we are reviewing other cost cutting measures  as we continue to evaluate the scope and duration of the current economic slowdown and its anticipated impact on our operations 
draw down of revolving credit facility on october   we requested to draw down million from our million revolver facility under the senior secured credit facility agreement  dated as of june   among us  merrill lynch  pierce fenner smith  incorporated  as syndication agent  wachovia bank  national association  as documentation agent  lehman commercial paper inc lehman  as administrative agent  and various lenders from time to time 
on october   we only received an aggregate of million of the million revolver as a result of lehman s failure to fund its million portion of the facility due to its bankruptcy filing 
the million drawn on october  currently bears interest at a rate equal to over the base prime rate unless converted to a libor based term rate 
as of october   the applicable margin of the revolving credit facility was i per annum for eurodollar loans or ii per annum for base rate loans 
on october   the draw down on the revolver was used  with other funds  to repay the non interest bearing secured promissory note of million 
please refer to the early extinguishment of the million non interest bearing promissory note section below for further details 

table of contents we are exploring options to replace lehman s commitment within the revolver  but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such replacement from others 
however  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to conduct our normal operations and do not believe that the potential reduction in available capacity under this revolver will have a material impact on our short term liquidity 
dividend payment on the series b preferred stock under the terms of our series b preferred stock  we are required to pay dividends at a rate of per year of the  liquidation preference per share of series b preferred stock 
from october  to october   we had the option to pay these dividends in either cash or additional shares of series b preferred stock 
on october   we paid our quarterly dividend in additional shares of our series b preferred stock 
after october   we are required to pay the quarterly dividends on our series b preferred stock in cash 
our ability to make the dividend payments described above will depend upon our future operating performance and on economic  financial  regulatory and other factors  many of which may be beyond our control 
nasdaq delisting letter and temporary postponement on october   we received a notification letter the letter from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq  notifying us that nasdaq has suspended  for a three month period  effective october   the enforcement of the rule requiring a minimum bid price and market value of publicly held shares the rule 
nasdaq has said that it will not take any action to delist any security for these concerns during the suspension period 
the letter stated that  given the current extraordinary market conditions  the suspension would remain in effect through friday  january  subsequently  nasdaq extended the suspension through july  we previously received a staff deficiency letter from nasdaq on august  indicating that the minimum bid price of our common stock had fallen below for consecutive trading days  and that it was therefore not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule b 
the staff deficiency letter further provided that in accordance with the nasdaq marketplace rules  we would be provided calendar days  or until february   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
we had calendar days remaining in our compliance period as of october   the effective date of nasdaq s suspension 
upon reinstatement of the rules on july   we will have the same number of days remaining  or until on or about november   to regain compliance 
we may regain compliance  either during the suspension or during the compliance period resuming after the suspension  by achieving a closing bid price for a minimum of consecutive trading days 
during this interim period  our common stock is expected to continue to trade on the nasdaq global market 
if compliance with marketplace rule b cannot be demonstrated on or about november   our common stock will be subject to delisting from the nasdaq global market 
we intend to use all reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market  but there can be no guarantee that we will regain compliance with the continued listing requirements  or will be able to demonstrate a plan to sustain compliance in order to avoid delisting from the nasdaq global market 
early extinguishment of the million non interest bearing promissory note on october   we entered into a letter agreement with bc media funding company ii  llc  as agent for media funding company  llc  successors in interest to the rights of wdlp broadcasting company  llc and robin broadcasting company  llc  for the early extinguishment of the  non interest bearing promissory note  due january  the note 
pursuant to the letter agreement  we received a discount of  and only paid  the payoff amount in full satisfaction due under the note 
we used cash on hand and million of proceeds drawn down from the revolving credit facility to satisfy the payoff amount 
in addition  on october   we were released from all obligations and liabilities  security interests  pledges  liens  mortgages  assignments or other interests granted by us and our subsidiaries pursuant to the security agreement  the pledge agreement  the note and any and all documentation related to the loan documents 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments  assumptions and estimates 
accounting for indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of fcc broadcast licenses 
fcc licenses are granted to stations for up to eight years under the telecommunications act of the act 
the act requires the fcc to renew a broadcast license if i it finds that the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  ii there have been no serious violations of either the communications act of or the fcc s rules and regulations by the licensee  and iii there have been no other serious violations  which taken together  constitute a pattern of abuse 
we intend to renew our licenses indefinitely and evidence supports our ability to do so 
historically  there has been no material challenge to our license renewals 
in addition  the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology any time in the foreseeable future 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
we do not amortize our fcc licenses 
we test these indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an event occurs that may indicate that impairment may have occurred 
our valuations principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which assumes the fcc licenses are acquired and operated by a third party 
this income approach incorporates variables such as types of signals  media competition  audience share  market advertising revenue  market revenue projections  anticipated operating profit margins and risk adjusted discount rates 
in the preparation of the fcc license appraisals  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the valuation of the intangible asset 
these estimates and assumptions could differ from actual results and could have a material impact on our financial statements in the future 
since the adoption of sfas no 
 we generally tested for impairment on our fcc license intangible assets at the individual license level 
also  we applied the guidance in eitf  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets eitf  to certain of our fcc license intangible assets if their signals were simulcasting and were operating as one revenue producing asset 
as of december   we modified the application of eitf from a simulcast station level to a market cluster level 
by not acquiring or disposing of any radio fcc licenses in the last two fiscal years  it has allowed our radio segment to mature and has permitted us to consolidate our operations in each market and streamline processes to ultimately reach increased economies of scale 
factors which influenced us to reach greater economies of scale were the current radio technologies available  the current economic conditions and the continued revenue declines in the radio broadcasting industry 
these factors  in addition to the factors described in the eitf discussion  caused us to review our application of eitf since we modified our application of eitf as of december  ie change of unit of accounting  we performed the impairment testing both at the individual license level and the market cluster level as required under eitf 
table of contents our goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations  when a business has been acquired under the applicable accounting literature 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level in lieu of being amortized 
we have determined that we have two reporting units under sfas no 
 radio and television 
we currently only have goodwill in our radio reporting unit 
we have aggregated our operating components radio stations into a single radio reporting unit based upon the similarity of their economic characteristics  including consideration of the requirements in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  as required by sfas no 
our evaluation included consideration of factors such as regulatory environment  business model  gross margins  nature of services and process for delivering these services 
in addition  we considered the guidance in d  clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph of fasb statement no 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit 
accordingly  the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
the estimated enterprise value of our radio reporting unit exceeded its carrying value during our impairment testing in in addition  as a result of the impairment of fcc licensees in our second fiscal quarter of  there is currently a net accumulated deficit in our radio reporting unit and we have a net overall accumulated deficit  therefore we have not performed a step two impairment test 
when evaluating our estimated enterprise value  we utilized an income approach which uses assumptions and estimates which among others include the aggregated expected revenues and operating margins generated by our fcc licenses ie our stations and use of a risk adjusted discount rate 
we did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization  including but not limited to our recent nasdaq delisting notice  limited trading volume  the impact of our television segment operating losses  and the significant voting control of our chairman and ceo 
accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 amortization of intangible assets and goodwill ceased for financial statement purposes 
as a result  we could not be assured that the reversals of the deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets and goodwill would occur within our net operating loss carry forward period 
therefore  on the date of adoption  we established a valuation allowance for the substantially all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we expect to continue to reserve for any increase in our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
interest and penalties on tax liabilities  if any  would be recorded in interest expense and other non interest expense  respectively 
valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which accounts are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our history of write offs  relationships with our customers  age of the invoices and the overall creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize broadcasting revenue as advertisements are aired on our stations  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  a fixed and determinable price  and reasonable assurance of collection 
agency commissions  where applicable  are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue 
advertisers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings  less their commission  to us when the advertisement is not placed directly by the advertiser 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as customer advances 
contingencies and litigations we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings

in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information that should enable financial statement users to understand how and why a company uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
 and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the required disclosures include the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format  information about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements  counterparty credit risk  and a company s strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments 
sfas no 
expands the current disclosure framework in sfas no 
and is effective prospectively for periods beginning on or after november  or fiscal year for us 
impact on inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition
