item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company 
we own and operate radio and publishing properties located primarily in the united states 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
arbitron inc generally measures radio station ratings weekly for markets measured by the portable people meter tm and four times a year for markets measured by diaries 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research  advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
these barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the product or service received 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for each of the past three years 
all revenues generated by our international radio properties are included in the local category 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities  political advertising and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national publication sales non traditional other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities  office expenses and salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 

table of contents known trends and uncertainties although the slowing global economy has negatively impacted advertising revenues for a wide variety of media businesses  domestic radio revenue growth has been challenged for several years 
management believes this is principally the result of four factors unrelated to the slowing economy the emergence of new media  such as various media content distributed via the internet and cable interconnects  which are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media  the perception of investors and advertisers that satellite radio and portable media players diminish the effectiveness of radio advertising  advertisers lack of confidence in the ratings of radio stations due to dated ratings gathering methods  and a lack of inventory and pricing discipline by radio operators 
the radio industry has begun several initiatives to address these issues  most notable of which is the rollout of hd radio 
hd radio offers listeners advantages over standard analog broadcasts  including improved sound quality and additional digital channels 
to make the rollout of hd radio more efficient  a consortium of broadcasters representing a majority of the radio stations in nearly all of our markets have agreed to work together to coordinate the programming on secondary channels in each radio market to ensure a more diverse consumer offering and to accelerate the rollout of hd radio receivers  particularly in automobiles 
in addition to offering secondary channels  the hd radio spectrum allows broadcasters to transmit other forms of data 
we are participating in a joint venture with other broadcasters to provide the bandwidth that a third party will use to transmit location based data to hand held and in car navigation devices 
we currently utilize hd radio digital technology on most of our fm stations 
it is unclear what impact hd radio will have on the markets in which we operate 
arbitron inc  the supplier of ratings data for united states radio markets  has developed technology to passively collect data for its ratings service 
the portable people meter tm is a small  pager sized device that does not require any active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm tm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
this service began in the new york  los angeles and chicago markets in october and is scheduled to begin for most of our other radio markets by september in each market  there has been a compression in the relative ratings of all stations in the market  enhancing the competitive pressure within the market for advertising dollars 
in addition  ratings for certain stations when measured by the ppm tm as opposed to the traditional diary methodology can be materially different 
the company continues to evaluate the impact ppm tm will have on our revenues in these markets 
as discussed below  our reformatted stations in los angeles and new york have negatively impacted their radio cluster s performance in their respective markets 
our los angeles and new york markets collectively account for approximately of our domestic radio revenues 
although our radio cluster in los angeles consisting of two stations exceeded the performance of the overall los angeles radio market during the year ended february   reformatted station kmvn fm tempered our results 
for the year ended february   our los angeles radio stations gross revenues were down versus the same period in the prior year  whereas the independent accounting firm miller  kaplan  arase co  llp miller kaplan reported that los angeles radio market total gross revenues were down 
kmvn fm lagged the market and its gross revenues were down for the year 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  we entered into a local programming and marketing agreement with a subsidiary of grupo radio centro  sab de cv grc  under which grc will pay emmis million dollars per year and reimburse certain expenses in exchange for the right to provide emmis with programming for kmvn fm for up to seven years 
at any time during the lma  grc has the right to purchase the station for million 
at the end of the lma  emmis has the right to require grc to purchase the station for the same amount 
our radio cluster in new york trailed the performance of the overall new york radio market during the year ended february  for the year ended february   our new york radio stations gross revenues were down  whereas the independent accounting firm miller kaplan reported that new york radio market total gross revenues were down versus the same period of the prior year 
the results of our new york radio stations were negatively impacted by our reformatted station  wrxp fm  whose gross revenues were down 
a radio station that was a primary competitor to wrxp fm recently changed its format and no longer competes directly with wrxp 
we are hopeful this development will help wrxp grow its audience and revenue share in fiscal collectively  our other two stations in the new york radio market exceeded the performance of the overall new york radio market during the year ended february  
table of contents as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of international radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 
we also regularly review our portfolio of assets and may opportunistically dispose of assets when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the annual impairment tests and when indicators of impairment are present  the interim impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macro economic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under sfas no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  or to the extent that market values decrease 
allocations for purchased assets we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to fcc licenses and goodwill assets 
as of february   we have recorded approximately million in fcc licenses and goodwill  which represents of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we conduct impairment testing required by sfas no 
at least annually and charge to operations an impairment expense if the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
in fiscal  we recorded a noncash impairment loss of million related to radio fcc licenses and million related to goodwill million related to domestic radio goodwill  million related to international radio goodwill and related to publishing division goodwill 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables include but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

these estimates are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize experts in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of our tax expense and related liabilities 
insurance claims and loss reserves the company is self insured for most healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
the company had million and million accrued for employee healthcare claims as of february  and february   respectively 
the company also maintains large deductible programs ranging from thousand to thousand per occurrence for workers compensation  employment liability  automotive liability and media liability claims 

table of contents valuation of stock options the company determines the fair value of its employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different than these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
the company relies heavily upon historical data for its stock price when determining expected volatility  but each year the company reassesses whether or not historical data is representative of expected results 
acquisitions  dispositions and investments during the three year period ended february   we acquired orange coast and two bulgarian radio networks for an aggregate cash purchase price of million
