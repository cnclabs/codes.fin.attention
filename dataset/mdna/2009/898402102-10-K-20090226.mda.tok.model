critical accounting policies trustmark s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the financial services industry 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  actual financial results could differ from those estimates 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
these critical accounting policies are described in detail below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for estimated loan losses charged against net income 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management  based on estimated probable losses within the existing loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timings of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 

table of contents trustmark s allowance for probable loan loss methodology is based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  as well as on other regulatory guidance 
the allowance for loan losses consists of three elements i specific valuation allowances determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  based on probable losses on specific loans  ii historical valuation allowances determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  based on historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends  and iii qualitative risk valuation allowances determined in accordance with sfas no 
based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors  both internal and external  to trustmark 
the allowances established for probable losses on specific commercial loans are based on an ongoing analysis and evaluation of classified loans 
loans are classified based on an internal credit risk grading process that evaluates  among other things i the obligor s ability to repay  ii the underlying collateral  if any  iii guarantor s ability to repay  if any  and iv the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates 
once a loan is classified  it is subject to review to determine whether or not the loan is impaired 
if determined to be impaired  the loan is evaluated using one of the valuation criteria permitted under sfas no 
the amount of impairment  if any  becomes a specific allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses and segregated from any pool of loans 
specific valuation allowances are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed  collateral deficiencies  the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry  among other things 
if  after review  a specific valuation allowance is not assigned to the loan and the loan is not considered to be impaired  the loan remains with a pool of similar risk rated loans that is assigned a valuation allowance calculated based on trustmark s internal loan grading system 
historical valuation allowances are calculated based on the historical loss experience of specific types of loans and trustmark s internal commercial risk graded loans 
trustmark calculates historical loss ratios for pools of similar loans with similar characteristics based on the proportion of actual charge offs experienced to the total population of loans in the pool 
the historical loss ratios are periodically updated based on actual charge off experience 
a historical valuation allowance is established for each pool of similar loans based upon the product of the historical loss ratio and the total dollar amount of the loans in the pool 
trustmark s pools of similar loans include consumer loans and family residential mortgages 
general valuation allowances are based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the bank 
in general  such valuation allowances are determined by evaluating  among other things i the experience  ability and effectiveness of the bank s lending management and staff  ii the effectiveness of trustmark s loan policies  procedures and internal controls  iii the changes in asset quality  iv the impact of rising interest rates on portfolio risk  v the accuracy of assigned risk ratings  vi national economic trends and conditions  vii consumer bankruptcy trends  viii the concentration of commercial and consumer credits  ix commercial real estate vacancy trends by region  x regional and local economic trends and conditions  xi collateral  financial and underwriting exception trends by region  xii the impact of recent acquisitions  and xiii the impact of significant natural disasters or catastrophes 
management evaluates the degree of risk that each one of these components has on the quality of the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis 
each component is determined to have either a high  moderate or low degree of risk 
for the period analyzed  management assesses whether the degree of risk for each component has increased  declined or remained neutral 
the results are then input into a qualitative factor allocation matrix to determine an appropriate qualitative risk allowance 
should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses change  trustmark s estimate of probable loan losses could also change  which could affect the level of future provisions for possible loan losses
