item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in part ii of this annual report 
this discussion also should be read in conjunction with the information in item ia of part i of this report  entitled risk factors  which contains information about certain risks and uncertainties that can affect our business and our financial performance in the future 
introduction and overview our business we provide grading and authentication services to dealers and collectors of high value coins  trading cards  event tickets  autographs  memorabilia and stamps collectibles 
we believe that our authentication and grading services add value to these collectibles by enhancing their marketability and thereby providing increased liquidity to the dealers  collectors and consumers that own  buy and sell them 
once we have authenticated and assigned a grade to a collectible  we encapsulate it in a tamper evident  clear plastic holder  or issue a certificate of authenticity  that i identifies the specific collectible  ii sets forth the quality grade we have assigned to it and iii bears one of our brand names and logos pcgs for coins  psa for trading cards and event tickets  psa dna for autographs and memorabilia and pse for stamps 
additionally  we warrant our certification of the authenticity and the quality grade that we assign to the coins  trading cards  currency and stamps bearing our brands 
we do not warrant the authenticity determinations we make with respect to autographs 
we principally generate revenues from the fees paid for our authentication and grading services 
to a much lesser extent  we generate revenues from other related services consisting of i the sale of advertising on our websites  ii the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in such publications and on our website  iii the sale of membership subscriptions in our collectors club  which is designed principally to attract interest in high value collectibles among new collectors  iv the sale of subscriptions to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for certified coins  and v the collectibles trade show conventions that we conduct 
we also generate revenues from sales of our collectibles inventory  which is comprised primarily of collectible coins that we have purchased under our coin grading warranty program  however  these activities are not the focus of or an integral part of our business 
acquired businesses in our continuing operations 
on july   we purchased  for an aggregate purchase price of  in cash  substantially all the assets of coinfacts 
com  which operated an internet website on which it published detailed proprietary information and history on us coins 
on september   we acquired  for an aggregate purchase price of  in cash  the common stock of certified coin exchange cce  which operates a subscription based dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for third party certified coins 
an affiliated  but unrelated business  ctp  was acquired as part of this acquisition and was disposed of by us in november effective july  we acquired  for an aggregate purchase price of  in cash  all of the outstanding ownership interests of expos unlimited llc expos  a california limited liability company engaged in the business of owning and conducting collectibles trade shows and conventions 
discontinued operations during the period from fiscal through the latter part of fiscal  we were also engaged in the business of authenticating and grading diamonds and colored gemstones the jewelry businesses and currency 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the board of directors approved a plan to dispose of our currency grading and authentication business  which we sold in february  in march  our board of directors adopted a plan to dispose of our jewelry businesses in order to focus our financial and managerial resources  and expertise  on our collectible coin  trading card  autographs and memorabilia and stamp authentication and grading businesses our collectibles businesses 
the decision to implement this plan was based on a number of factors and considerations that included  among others  the continued operating losses of the jewelry businesses  which had proved to be disappointing and had not met expectations  the current economic climate prevailing in the united states  which has materially and adversely affected the jewelry and other luxury goods markets  and the additional capital that would be required to grow the jewelry businesses in comparison to the lower capital requirements of our collectibles grading and authentication businesses 
see business recent developments discontinued operations of collectibles sales businesses in part i of this report 
pursuant to that plan  in march we discontinued our jewelry businesses and have disposed of substantially all the assets of our jewelry businesses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors decided that we cease internal development of the business or assets of the gemprint identification technologies  which we acquired in fiscal  and we are currently in the process of selling the gemprint assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 the assets and related liabilities of these businesses and their related operating results were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and prior period financial statements have been restated on that same basis 
see selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements contained in item in part ii of this report 
additionally  as a result of our divestiture of our jewelry and currency authentication and grading businesses and their classification as discontinued operations  our collectibles authentication and grading businesses comprise our continuing operations and the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on those businesses factors that can affect operating results and our financial position factors that can affect our revenues 
our revenues generated by our continuing operations are comprised of i fees generated by our authentication and grading of high value collectibles  and ii to a lesser extent  revenues from sales of collectibles club memberships  advertising on our websites and in printed publications and collectibles price guides  subscription based revenues primarily generated by our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for collectible coins that have been authenticated and graded collectively  certified and fees earned from the management  operation and promotion of collectibles trade shows and conventions 
our revenues also include revenues from sales of products  which consist primarily of coins that we purchase under our warranty policy 
however  those revenues  which vary from period to period depending on the volume and dollar amounts of the coin warranty claims we receive  are not the focus and do not constitute an integral part of our business 
our authentication and grading fees accounted for approximately of our total net revenues in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  and in fiscal the amounts of such revenues are primarily affected by i the volume and mix of authentication and grading submissions among coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and other collectibles on the other hand  ii in the case of coins and trading cards  the turn around times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and modern coins and trading cards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turn around times for vintage or classic coins and trading cards than they do for modern submissions  as vintage or classic collectibles are of significantly higher value and are more saleable by dealers than modern coins and trading cards 
our revenues also are affected by the level of coin authentication and grading submissions we receive at collectibles trade shows where we provide on site authentication and grading services to show attendees  because they typically request higher priced same day turn around for the coins they submit at those shows 
the level of trade show submissions will vary from period to period depending upon a number of factors  including the number and the timing of the shows  the volume of collectible coins bought or sold at those shows by dealers and collectors  and short term decisions made by dealers during shows  in addition  the number of such submissions and  therefore  the revenues we generate from the authentication and grading of coins at trade shows can be impacted by short term changes in the price of gold that sometimes occur around the time of the shows  which can affect the volume of coin transactions that take place at the shows 
five of our coin authentication and grading customers accounted  in the aggregate  for approximately of our total net revenues in the fiscal year ended june  as a result  the loss of any of those customers  or a significant decrease in the volume of grading submissions from any of them to us  would cause our net revenues to decline and  therefore  could adversely affect our results of operations 
factors affecting our gross profit margins 
the gross profit margins we earn on collectibles authentication and grading submissions also are primarily affected by i the volume and mix of those submissions among coins  trading cards and other collectibles  because we generally realize higher margins on coin submissions than on submissions of other collectibles  ii in the case of coins and trading cards  the turn around times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and modern coins and trading cards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turn around times for vintage or classic coins and trading cards than they do for modern submissions 
furthermore  because a significant proportion of our costs of sales are fixed in nature in the short term  our gross profit margin is also affected by the overall volume of collectibles that we authenticate and grade in any period 
impact of economic conditions on our financial performance 
we generate all of our revenues from continuing operations from the collectibles markets 
as a result  the demand for our services and  therefore  our revenues  depend to a great extent on the volume of purchases and sales of the high value collectibles that we authenticate  because dealers and collectors most often submit collectibles to us for authenticating and grading in anticipation of or in connection with their sales and purchases of those collectibles collectibles transactions 
the volume of collectibles transactions is  in turn  primarily affected by i the disposable income available to collectors and their confidence about future economic conditions  because high value collectibles are generally viewed as luxury goods and are purchased with disposable income  ii the cash flows generated by collectibles dealers and their confidence about future economic conditions  which affect the willingness of such dealers to purchase collectibles for resale  iii the availability and cost of borrowings because collectibles dealers often rely on borrowings to fund their purchases of collectibles  iv prevailing and anticipated rates of inflation  because the threat of and actual increases in inflation often lead investors and consumers to purchase gold and silver coins as a hedge against inflation  and v the performance and volatility of the gold and other precious metals markets and the stock markets  which affects the level of purchases and sales of collectible coins  because investors and consumers will often increase their purchases of gold coins if they believe that the market prices of gold will increase or the prices of stock will decline 
as a result  generally  collectibles transactions and  as a result  the demand for our authentication and grading services  increase during periods characterized by economic growth  accessibility to lower cost borrowings  or increases in inflation or in gold prices 
by contrast  collectibles transactions and  therefore  the demand for our services generally decline during periods characterized by economic downturns or recessions  declines in consumer and business confidence  an absence of inflationary pressure  or declines in the market prices of gold 
however  these conditions can sometimes counteract each other as it is not uncommon  for example  for investors to shift funds from gold to stocks during periods of economic growth and consumer and business confidence 
the current economic recession in the united states  continued uncertainty about the ultimate severity and duration of that recession  declines in cash flow that is available to collectibles dealers as a result of the credit crisis which has made it difficult for collectibles dealers to obtain borrowings to fund their purchases and the carrying costs of maintaining an inventory of high value collectibles  combined to reduce the volume of collectibles transactions and the demand for our services during the fiscal year ended june  as a result  during that year  we experienced declines in the demand for and in the revenues generated by all of our authentication and grading businesses 
the following tables provide information regarding the respective number of coins  trading cards  autographs and stamps that we graded or authenticated in the fiscal years ended june    and units processed coins trading cards autographs stamps total the following table sets forth the estimated values at which our customers insured the coins  trading cards  autographs and stamps that they submitted to us for grading or authentication 
declared values coins trading cards autographs stamps total factors that can affect our financial position 
a substantial number of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading 
as a result  historically  we have been able to rely on internally generated cash and have never incurred borrowings to fund our continuing operations 
we expect that internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations 
besides the day to day operating performance of our business  our overall financial position can also be affected by the company s capital raising or stock buyback activities  the dividend policy adopted by the board of directors from time to time  and the company s decisions to invest in and to fund the acquisition of new established businesses and or early stage businesses 
in addition  our financial position reflects the company s tax position in that the company may only be required to pay minimum taxes  when it has net operating losses available to offset current period taxable income and the investment policy adopted for its cash balances  as this will impact the level of interest income earned on those cash balances 
trends and challenges in and opportunities for our businesses the principal trends affecting our business are the economic recession and credit crisis  and uncertainties as to the ultimate severity and duration are continuing to adversely affect collectibles commerce and  as a result  the demand for our services and  hence  our revenues 
we do not know and cannot predict  with any level of assurance  the changes in the spending and savings habits of consumers and collectibles dealers and the effect of these changes on our business 
as a result  we will continue to focus on i achieving further reductions in our cost structure for cost of sales and our selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal as a means to offset the potential impact of the economic recession and credit crisis on our net revenues and ii developing new sources of revenues within the collectibles market  in order to increase our net revenues and  together with costs savings  to increase our profitability 
overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth comparative financial data for the years ended june  and year ended june  year ended june  amount percent of revenues amount percent of revenues net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses impairment losses amortization of intangible assets operating income interest income  net other income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss net loss per diluted share income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss as the above table indicates  despite a million  or decrease in net revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  our gross profits declined by only  or  and our operating income inclusive of an impairment loss of  increased by  or  in fiscal  compared with due primarily to an  decrease in interest income in fiscal  as compared to  which more than offset the increase in operating income that we achieved  our pre tax income decreased by  or  in  compared to that decrease in interest income was attributable to the combined effects of declines in our average cash balances and prevailing interest rates during fiscal the improved operating performance primarily reflects cost reductions and efficiencies implemented in fiscal and the absence of the increased warranty costs of  that we recognized in fiscal see critical accounting policies and estimates grading warranty costs below 
the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal of  was  primarily  the result of the operating losses  impairment losses and losses we recognized on the closure and disposal of our former jewelry authentication and grading businesses and our currency grading business that we exited in fiscal the losses on the closure and disposal of our jewelry businesses included  for on going lease commitments and other charges that we will have to pay under leases for office facilities  in new york city  that had been occupied by our jewelry businesses prior to our discontinuance of and exit from those businesses 
at june   the amount of such accrual was these  as well as other factors affecting our operating results in the fiscal  are described in more detail below 
see results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of certain of our assets  principally accounts and notes receivable and inventories  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our accounts receivable or realize the value of our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates  and assumptions are based on current information available to us at that time 
many of those conditions  trends and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and  if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our judgments or estimates were based  or other unanticipated events were to happen that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates 
changes in such estimates may require that we reduce the carrying value of the affected assets on our balance sheet which are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances to record such downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets  such as for example accounts and notes receivable and inventory 
such write downs are recorded as charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are established or increased to take account of changed conditions or events 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events and changes in the conditions  events or trends upon which those estimates and judgments were made  can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record such assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of adjustments or write downs of this nature also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or conditions  such as increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances for their full effects to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
during fiscal year and in the first quarter of fiscal year  we acquired certain businesses and assets some of which are now classified as part of discontinued operations  as we have closed  or disposed of or are in the process of selling such assets and  in accordance with gaap  we accounted for those acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
that accounting method required us to allocate amounts paid for those businesses in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  and to classify that excess as goodwill 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if we believe that goodwill has been impaired in the interim due to changing facts or events see goodwill below 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have definite lives are subject to amortization over their remaining useful lives see long lived assets other than goodwill below 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to on going evaluation for impairment 
management formally evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on the anniversary date of each of the business acquisitions that gave rise to the recording of such assets 
in the event it is determined  from any such impairment analysis  that the estimated fair value of any such assets has declined below their carrying values  it would become necessary for us to recognize an impairment charge that would have the effect of reducing our income in the period when that charge is recognized 
we also estimate losses associated with the disposal of a business or the sale of assets when a decision has been made to dispose of or discontinue such business 
in accordance with gaap  assets available for sale are stated at the lower of costs or their net realizable value 
in addition  the estimated fair value of liabilities for employee terminations is recognized as of the date such terminations are communicated to the affected employees and for lease obligations as of the date we cease using the real property or equipment subject to the lease 
in making our estimates and assumptions  we follow gaap in order to enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for possible write downs in the carrying values of our assets 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and critical estimates that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policies 
we generally record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the customer 
due to the insignificant delay between the completion of our grading and authentication services and the shipment of the collectible or high value asset back to the customer  the time of shipment corresponds to the completion of our services 
many of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue until the collectibles have been authenticated and graded and shipped back to them 
at that time  we record the revenues from the authentication and grading services we have performed for the customer and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for certain dealers to whom we extend open account privileges  we record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the dealer 
with respect to our expos trade show business  we recognize revenue generated by the promotion  management and operation of each of its collectibles conventions or trade shows in the fiscal period in which the convention or show takes place 
a portion of our net revenues is comprised of subscription fees paid by customers for memberships in our collectors club 
those memberships entitle members to access our on line and printed publications and  sometimes also to vouchers for free grading services from us 
we record revenue for this multi element service arrangement in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  by recognizing approximately of the subscription fee in the month following the membership purchase  on the basis that collectors club members typically utilize their vouchers for free grading services within days of subscribing for memberships 
we review this estimate at least semi annually by recalculating the percentage based on the relative values of the various elements in the collectors club offering and determining the appropriate percentage to attribute to the grading services and the remaining subscription 
our estimates have proven to be consistently around on an on going basis 
the balance of the membership fee is recognized as revenue over the life of the membership  which can range from one to two years 
we recognize the revenue from the sale of a product when it is shipped to the customer and all the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  issued by the securities and exchange commission sec  have been satisfied 
such products consist primarily of collectible coins that we purchased pursuant to our coin authentication and grading warranty program and such sales are not considered an integral part of our on going revenue generating activities 
accrual for losses on facility leases 
as a result of the discontinuance of and our exit from the jewelry authentication and grading businesses  we ceased the occupancy of facilities we had leased for their operations 
we have retained a commercial real estate broker to sublease those facilities on our behalf 
at march   we recorded an expense of approximately  to establish loss accruals totaling  for estimated losses under those leases 
the amount of those lease accruals was determined based on estimates on a discounted basis of i prevailing sublease rates in the real estate market where those facilities are located as compared to our rental obligations under the leases  ii the time we expect it will take to sublet those facilities  and iii other direct costs associated with the leases 
such estimates were reviewed and updated to approximately  based on an updated market analysis at june  such estimates continue to be uncertain due to the economic recession which has led to substantial increases in vacancies and  therefore  in the space available for lease in commercial office buildings in the market where these facilities are located 
as a result  we will continue to review and  if necessary  make adjustments to the accruals on a quarterly basis 
if it becomes necessary to increase those accruals in the future as a result of  for example  changes in our estimate of market rents or our estimate of the time it will take to sublet the facilities  such increases will be classified as an increase in the loss from discontinued operations 
accounts receivable  notes receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our authentication and grading business  we extend payment terms to many of the larger  more creditworthy dealers who submit collectibles to us for authentication and grading on an going basis 
in addition  primarily in connection with our dealer financing program  we have made advances or extended credit under notes receivable arrangements with selected dealers 
we regularly review our accounts and notes receivable  estimate the amounts of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible accounts or notes in each quarterly period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age and extent of significant past due accounts  and in the case of customer notes receivable  the current value of the collateral we hold as security for the payment obligations under the notes receivable  and known conditions or trends that may affect the ability of account debtors or note obligors to pay their accounts or notes receivable balances 
each quarter we review our estimates of uncollectible amounts and  if necessary  adjust the allowance to take account of changes in economic or other conditions or trends that we believe will have an adverse effect on the ability of any of the account debtors or note obligors to pay their accounts or notes in full 
since the allowance is increased by recording a charge against income that is reflected in general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results 
inventory valuation reserves 
our collectibles inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and have been reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for potential declines in the value of those inventories below their carrying values 
the amount of the allowance is determined and is periodically adjusted on the basis of market knowledge  historical experience and estimates concerning future economic conditions or trends that may impact the sale value of the collectibles inventories 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness and special features of some of the collectibles included in our collectibles inventory and the volatility in the prices of precious metals  valuation of such collectibles often involves judgments that are more subjective than those that are required when determining the market values of more standardized products 
as a result  we review the market values of the collectibles in our inventory on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to the valuation reserve that we believe are necessary or prudent based on our judgments regarding these matters 
in the event that a collectible is sold for a price below its carrying value  we record a charge to operating income 
grading warranty costs 
we offer a limited warranty covering the coins  trading cards and stamps that we authenticate and grade 
under the warranty  if such a collectible that was previously authenticated and graded by us is later submitted to us for re grading and either i receives a lower grade upon resubmittal or ii is determined not to have been authentic  we will offer to purchase the collectible for a price equal to the value of collectible at its original grade  or  at our option  pay the difference between the value of the collectible at its original grade as compared with the value at its lower grade 
however this warranty is voided if the collectible  upon resubmittal to us  is not in the same tamper resistant holder in which it was placed at the time we last graded the item or if we otherwise determine that the collectible had been altered after we had authenticated and graded it 
if we purchase an item under a warranty claim  we recognize the difference in the value of the item at its original grade and its re graded estimated value as a reduction in our warranty reserve 
we include the purchased item in our inventory at the estimated re graded value of the collectible  which will be lower than the price we paid to purchase the item 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience 
certain warranty claims were received by us in the second quarter and early in third quarter of fiscal that were significant in relation to our historical claims experience and  as a result  we recognized  in the second quarter of  additional warranty expense of  in respect of those claims 
we also decided to increase our warranty accrual rate  effective january   to reflect this higher warranty claims experience  and we continue to monitor the adequacy of our warranty reserve on an on going basis 
there also are a number of factors that can cause the estimated values of the collectibles purchased under our warranty program to change over time and  as a result  we review the market values of those collectibles see inventory valuation reserves above 
however  once we have classified such items as inventory and they have been held in inventory beyond the end of the fiscal quarter in which we purchased them  we classify any gains or losses on the subsequent disposal of such items as part of the gain or loss on product sales and not as an adjustment to our warranty reserves 
long lived assets other than goodwill 
we regularly conduct reviews of property and equipment and other long lived assets other than goodwill  including certain identifiable intangibles  for possible impairment 
such reviews occur annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in full 
in order to determine if the value of a definite lived asset is impaired  we make an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition in order to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recorded to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
we incurred significant operating losses in our two jewelry businesses subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition as those businesses failed to meet management s revenue expectations and  as a result  we recognized initial impairment losses on our identifiable tangible and intangible assets in those businesses totaling  in the three months and for the year ended june  in the three months ended december   we recognized additional impairment losses of  on our identifiable tangible and intangible assets in the jewelry authentication and grading businesses  due to continued uncertainties as to the level of revenues we could expect those businesses to generate in the future  worse than expected financial performance during the first six months of fiscal and the increasing severity of the economic recession and credit crisis which adversely affected the future prospects of those businesses 
in the three months ended march   we decided to exit those businesses  and  in the three months ended june   we decided to exit our related gemprint business 
as a result  the impairment losses that were attributable to those jewelry businesses have been classified as part of discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed the long lived assets of our continuing businesses and concluded that certain capitalized software used in our autograph business was not recoverable in full due to technical and operational inefficiency issues 
as a result  we recognized an impairment loss of  in our continuing operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended june  goodwill 
we test the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets of our acquired businesses at least annually on their respective acquisition anniversary dates  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are determined to exist 
we apply a discounted cash flow model or an income approach in estimating the fair value of each of those businesses that we have determined constitutes a separate reporting unit  and we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its then carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists as of the measurement date 
if  instead  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value  then there is the possibility of goodwill impairment and further testing and re measurement of goodwill is required 
in accordance with gaap  we considered the diamond grading business and the colored gemstone grading business as separate reporting units for the purpose of testing for the impairment of the goodwill 
we incurred significant operating losses in each of those reporting units subsequent to the respective dates of their acquisition  as those units failed to meet revenue expectations established for them by management 
as a result  in the three months and year ended june  we recognized initial impairment losses to the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets of these businesses totaling  due to continued uncertainties as to the future revenues of these businesses  their worse than expected financial performance during the first half of fiscal and the anticipated effects on those businesses of the increasing severity of the economic recession and credit crisis  in the three months ended december  we recognized additional goodwill impairment losses in those businesses totaling  which resulted in full impairment of goodwill in these businesses 
as a result of our decision  made in march  to exit the jewelry grading and authentication businesses  these impairment losses have been classified as part of discontinued operations for the years ended june  and stock based compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense based on the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the black scholes option valuation method 
under that method  we make assumptions with respect to the expected lives of the options or other stock awards that have been granted and are outstanding  the expected volatility and the dividend yield percentage of our common stock and the risk free interest rate at the respective dates of grant 
in addition  under sfas no 
r  we recognize and report share based compensation expense net of a forfeiture rate with respect to outstanding awards that we expect will occur over their respective vesting periods  which we estimate on the basis of historical forfeiture experience or other factors that could affect the likelihood of forfeiture 
we monitor the forfeiture rate closely to ensure that all stock awards that vest are fully expensed over their respective vesting periods using the straight line attribution method 
during the years ended june   and  we awarded restricted shares to the outside members of the board of directors and to our senior management  and  accordingly  we recognize stock based compensation over the respective vesting periods of such awards based upon the closing stock prices of the shares on their respective dates of the grant  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
upon termination of employment or service with the company  unvested restricted shares are cancelled and those shares are returned to their status as unissued shares available for future stock awards 
capitalized software 
in fiscal years  and we capitalized  for continuing operations  approximately   and  respectively  of software development costs related to a number of in house software development projects  in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
in addition  during the fiscal years through  we capitalized approximately  of software developments costs relating to our discontinued businesses 
sop requires that certain software development costs incurred  either from internal or external sources  be capitalized as part of intangible assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software  which we believe is conservatively estimated at three years 
on the other hand  planning  training  support and maintenance costs incurred either prior to or following the implementation phase of a software development project are recognized as expense in the periods in which they are incurred 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we recorded approximately   and  respectively  as amortization expense related to such capitalized software projects 
we evaluate the carrying values of capitalized software to determine if those values are impaired and  if necessary  we record an impairment charge in the period in which we determine that an impairment has occurred 
based on such an evaluation  we concluded that as of june  certain capitalized software used in our autograph and memorabilia authentication and grading business was not recoverable in full due to technical and operational inefficiency issues 
as a result  we recognized an impairment loss of  in our continuing operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended june  see long lived assets other than goodwill above 
income taxes and deferred tax assets 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
sfas no 
requires the recording of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets or liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires that we evaluate the probability of realizing the future income tax benefits comprising that asset based on a number of factors  which include projections of future taxable income and the nature of the tax benefits and the respective expiration dates of tax credits and net operating losses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to the length of time and the extent of the taxable income required to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to impairment losses recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as certain california enterprise zone credits  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against deferred tax assets totaling million at june  at that time we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize the tax benefits comprising the remaining million net deferred tax assets at june  at june   due to the recognition of additional impairment losses in our jewelry businesses  and uncertainties of our future financial performance arising from the economic recession and credit crisis  we did not recognize any additional deferred tax assets for the losses related to the impairment and disposal of our discontinued businesses in fiscal at june   we had established valuation allowances against the entirety of our deferred tax assets 
included in our deferred tax asset balances at june  and december   were deferred tax assets of  related to compensation expense recorded in connection with the grant of non employee supplier stock options in those options expired unexercised during fiscal and  as a result  the amount of that deferred tax asset was ultimately written down to zero at june  in accordance with sfas r and related interpretations  that write down has been recognized as a reduction to additional paid in capital of  at june  we recorded a deferred income tax liability of  on our balance sheet at june   which arose out of timing differences for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets that are amortizable for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes under gaap 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and  in addition  requires us to disclose our policy for the classification of interest and penalties in our statements of operations 
fin requires that we make adjustments in our financial statements to reflect only tax positions which we believe are more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the positions 
fin requires that any necessary adjustment be recorded directly to the beginning balance of retained earnings or accumulated deficit in the period of adoption of fin and reported as a change in accounting principle  if material 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the cumulative effects of applying fin were recorded as an increase of  to our accumulated deficit  an increase to income taxes payable of  and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of  we also recognized interest and penalties totaling  as of july   the date of the adoption of fin  which were accounted for as part of the total adjustment to accumulated deficit of  during the fiscal years ended june  and  which followed the adoption of fin  we recorded approximately  and  respectively  in interest and penalties as components of income tax expense

fiscal vs 
in fiscal  our net revenues declined by  or  compared to fiscal that decline was attributable  primarily  to i a  or  decrease in authentication and grading fees  and ii a  or  decrease in the revenues generated by other related service businesses and our product sales 
excluding product sales  which we do not consider to be an integral part of our revenue generating activities  in fiscal  revenues generated by our other related service businesses would have been substantially the same as in fiscal and our total net revenues would have declined by  as compared to the total net revenues that we generated in fiscal the decrease in authentication and grading fees in fiscal was attributable to decreases in the fees generated by all of our authentication and grading businesses 
coin  trading card and autograph and stamp authentication and grading fees decreased by approximately  or   or  and approximately  or  respectively  in fiscal the decrease in coin authentication and grading fees was the result of i a million or decrease in the on site authentication and grading fees generated at coin trade shows and ii a million or decrease in modern coin grading fees  which were partially offset by iii a million or increase in the fees generated from the authentication and grading of vintage coins  the submissions of which increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal these decreases in authentication and grading fees were due primarily to decreases in coin  trading card and autograph and stamp authentication and grading submissions in we believe those decreases were primarily the result of the economic recession and credit crisis in the united states  which caused declines in the confidence among dealers and collectors about future economic conditions and reduced the availability of business and consumer credit 
we also believe that uncertainties created by increases and greater volatility in gold prices made collectibles dealers and collectors reluctant to engage in collectible coin transactions  which resulted in declines in trade show authentication and grading submissions in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  however  our total authentication and grading revenues were approximately the same as in the same quarter of fiscal due primarily to a increase in coin authentication and grading fees which more than offset decreases of and  respectively  in the fees from our authentication and grading of trading cards and autographs and stamps 
the increase in coin authentication and grading fees was attributable  primarily  to an increase of the grading and authentication of modern coins in the quarter 
however  due to the continuing uncertainties about the duration and severity of the economic recession and credit crisis  we are not able to predict  with any assurance  whether or not the increase in coin authentication and grading revenues will continue into fiscal  nor the level of authentication and grading revenues for trading cards  autographs and stamps in fiscal fiscal vs 
in fiscal  our net revenues increased by  or  compared to fiscal that increase was due primarily to an increase in other related service and product sales revenues totaling  or  partially offset by an  or  decrease in authentication and grading fees 
if product sales are excluded  our other related service revenues increased by  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  however  the increase in total revenues in fiscal would have been  that increase in product sales revenue was attributable to an increase in the number and dollar amounts of coin warranty claims received in fiscal and  as a result  in the amount of coins we purchased in satisfaction of those claims and then sold 
the  increase in other related service revenues in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily the result of revenues that we generated from an increase in third party advertising in our coin and trading card publications and an increase in revenues generated by our cfc dealer financing programs 
the  decrease in authentication and grading fees in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to a  or  decrease in coin authentication and grading fees  which was partially offset by increases in revenues of  or  and  or  from the authentication and grading of trading cards and autographs and stamps  respectively 
the decline in coin authentication and grading revenues in  compared to fiscal  was the result of a decrease in revenues generated at trade shows  as a result of i our attending two fewer collectibles trade shows in fiscal than in fiscal  and ii a decrease in grading submissions at the trade shows we attended in the second half of fiscal an increase in vintage coin submissions  on which we usually generate higher revenues due primarily to faster turn around times requested by submitters  resulted in a increase in revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  however  that increase was largely offset by a decrease in revenues from modern coins authentication and grading submissions in fiscal gross profit gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
the costs of authentication and grading revenues consist primarily of labor to authenticate and grade collectibles  production costs  credit card fees  warranty expense  occupancy  security  depreciation  amortization and insurance costs that directly relate to providing authentication and grading services 
cost of revenues also includes printing  other direct costs of the revenues generated by our other related services businesses and the costs of product revenues  which represent the carrying value of the inventory of products primarily collectible coins that we sold 
in addition  costs of revenues include stock based compensation attributable to stock incentive awards granted to employees whose compensation is classified as part of the costs of authentication and grading revenues 
set forth below is information regarding our gross profits in the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin fiscal vs 
as indicated in the above table  our total gross profit margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal excluding the effect of product revenues for all periods  which are not an integral part of our core revenues generating activities  and increased warranty costs of  in fiscal as a result of unexpected claims in significant dollar amounts that arose during that period  the gross profit margin for grading and authentication and other related services would have been for fiscal  compared with for fiscal the improvement in the gross profit margins are the result primarily of cost improvement programs  including headcount and publications direct costs reductions  implemented in our coin grading business in response to the decline in revenues in  compared to  partially offset by a lower gross margin on cards and autographs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the gross profit margin  excluding the effect of coin sales  increased to  compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal that increase was due the combined effects of the increase in coin authentication and grading revenues and the cost savings  as discussed above 
however  we are not able to predict whether these improvements in gross margin represent the beginning of a trend  due to the continued uncertainties for our business created by the continuing economic recession and credit crisis 
fiscal vs 
as indicated in the above table  our total gross profit margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal excluding the unusually higher warranty costs of  in and the effects of product sales on gross margin both in fiscal and  our gross profit margin would have been in fiscal as compared to in fiscal that decline was primarily attributable to i a decrease in coin authentication and grading revenues in fiscal that was due to a decrease in the number of coins graded and a change in the mix of coin authentication and grading submissions to a higher proportion of modern coin submissions on which we realize lower margins because the average service fee earned on modern coins is lower than on vintage coins  and ii an increase in personnel  travel  printing  and on going warranty costs in support of our coin grading activities 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of advertising and promotions costs  trade show expenses  customer service personnel costs  depreciation and third party consulting costs 
fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues fiscal vs 
in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses decreased by  and as a percentage of net revenues  notwithstanding the decrease in net revenues in fiscal that decrease was primarily attributable to the implementation of a cost savings program that included reductions in personnel  media costs and the expenses of providing on site grading services at collectibles trade shows  as well as a reduction in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  in the mix of trade shows at which we offered on site trading card and stamp authentication and grading services 
fiscal vs 
the  increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily attributable to an increase in business development activities primarily by our collectibles grading and subscription divisions  which included an increase in expenditures for promotional programs and increase in the number of trade shows at which we offered on site trading card and stamp authentication and grading services 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses are comprised primarily of compensation paid to general and administrative personnel  including executive management  finance and accounting personnel and information technology personnel  facilities management costs  depreciation  amortization and other miscellaneous expenses 
g a expenses also include stock based compensation costs  determined in accordance with sfas no 
r  arising from the grant of stock awards to general and administrative personnel 
the following table compares our g a expenses that we incurred in fiscal to the g a expenses we incurred in fiscal and fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands general administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in g a expenses of  in fiscal compared to fiscal  was due primarily to cost reduction measures implemented in fiscal to bring g a expenses more into line with revenues 
those measures  which included  among others  workforce reductions and reductions in professional fees  enabled us to keep g a expenses  as a percentage of revenues  at despite the decline in revenues in fiscal those reductions in g a expenses more than offset severance costs of approximately  recognized  in the third quarter of fiscal  in connection with the departure of the company s former chief executive officer 
also contributing to the decrease in g a expenses was a  decrease in stock based compensation expense in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to i a reduction in the number of stock awards granted in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and ii an increase in forfeitures of outstanding stock awards during the third quarter of fiscal vs 
the reduction in g a expenses of  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to savings in legal  professional and outside services costs and a lower level of corporate information technology personnel costs in fiscal  compared to those cost savings more than offset a  increase in stock based compensation costs due primarily to an increase in restricted stock awards granted to our officers and directors in fiscal impairment losses fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands impairment losses as a percentage of net revenues the impairment loss in fiscal was attributable to a determination that  due to technical and operational inefficiencies  the carrying value of capitalized software developed for our autograph business was impaired at june  amortization of intangible assets fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands amortization expense as a percentage of net revenues the increase in the amortization expense of  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to the amortization of capitalized software costs  for which amortization commences as development projects are completed 
in addition  we also incur amortization costs in connection with the intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions that occurred during fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal capitalized software costs and acquired intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
amortization expense  for fiscal  includes approximately  resulting from the amortization of capitalized software costs invested in the development of software for our autograph business that we determined was impaired at june   and for which we recognized an impairment loss in fiscal see results of operations impairment losses above

stock based compensation expense is recorded as part of i costs of sales  in the case of stock awards granted to employees whose costs are classified as cost of revenues  ii selling and marketing expenses in the case of stock awards granted to marketing and sales personnel  and iii general and administrative expenses in the case of stock awards granted to directors  executive and financial management and administrative personnel  as follows fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands cost of revenues selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses generally  the vesting of stock option and restricted stock awards that we have granted to officers  employees and outside directors is conditioned on continued employment or service with the company during a specified time period or periods vesting periods 
typically  the vesting period is four years for officer and employee awards and shorter periods for director awards  reflecting their service periods  although we have  on occasion  granted stock awards that become vested  in part or in whole  on the date of grant 
in accordance with sfas r  stock based compensation expense is determined over the respective vesting periods of the awards  calculated on a straight line basis  net of an estimated forfeiture rate which  in the case of restricted stock awards was in and in both and and in the case of stock option grants was in each of fiscal and and in fiscal see critical accounting policies and estimates stock based compensation above

there were no new options granted in fiscal  although all options outstanding were adjusted for the stock dividend in october  as required under the original terms of such option grants 
we calculate stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock options as of their respective grant dates using the black scholes option valuation model and various assumptions that are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and recognize such costs on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options 
a total of  of compensation expense related to unvested stock based compensation awards remained unrecognized as of june  and will be recognized as compensation expense as follows year ending june  amount total these amounts  which are non cash expenses  do not include the cost of any additional stock based compensation awards that may be granted in future periods nor  as mentioned above  any changes that might occur in the company s forfeiture percentage 
interest income  net interest income is generated on cash balances that we have invested  primarily in highly liquid money market accounts and funds  short term bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper instruments and tax free funds 
such interest income does not include the interest that we generate on loans we make pursuant to our dealer finance program  which are included in net revenues 
the following table compares the interest income we earned in the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands interest income  net percent of net revenue fiscal and interest income  net  was  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal that decrease was primarily attributable to i a shift of our cash and cash equivalent balances into lower yielding government guaranteed money market funds  ii a decrease in our average cash balances in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to our use of a portion of our available cash to fund quarterly dividends  share repurchases  capital expenditures  and the losses incurred by our discontinued operations  and iii a decrease in interest rates earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to reductions in prevailing market rates of interest as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board in response to the increased severity of the economic recession and credit crisis

in accordance with sfas  valuation allowances established in fiscal against deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year are attributable to continuing operations 
see critical accounting policies and estimates income tax and deferred tax assets 
the income tax provision recorded in fiscal reflects tax at the effective rate for fiscal and a valuation allowance for california enterprise zone tax credits  due to our determination that it had become more likely than not that we would be unable to recover  in full  the income tax benefits comprising our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal for fiscal  the effective tax benefit was approximately and reflected the higher percentage of permanent differences between income for book and income for tax purposes due to the level of losses in discontinued operations fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands loss from discontinued operations  net of gains on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal  primarily reflects i losses of  that we recognized on the discontinuance and exit from our jewelry authentication and grading businesses in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  ii impairment losses of  recognized at december  to the carrying values of long lived assets and goodwill of those jewelry businesses  and iii losses of  incurred from the on going operations of our discontinued businesses from july  through the date of their discontinuance  which was march  no income tax benefits were recognized in connection with the recognition of those losses in fiscal  due to uncertainly as to the realization of our deferred tax assets in future periods 
see critical accounting policies and estimates long lived assets other than goodwill goodwill and income taxes and deferred tax assets above for a discussion of the impairment losses to the carrying values of our jewelry businesses recognized at december  the losses that we recognized in fiscal  in connection with the discontinuance of our jewelry authentication and grading businesses  were comprised of i  of operating lease accruals representing the expected loss on the leases for the facilities that had been occupied by those businesses  ii approximately  of estimated losses on the disposal of the assets of our jewelry authentication and grading businesses  and iii approximately  of severance costs incurred in connection with the termination of employment of the employees of those businesses 
the amount of the operating lease accruals was determined based on our estimates of the time that it will take to sublease those facilities and the rents at which we could expect to sublease those facilities over the remaining duration of the leases  discounted to present value 
those estimates  in turn  were based primarily on rental market surveys that were conducted for us by independent real estate consulting firms 
we are in the process of seeking subtenants for these facilities and we will re evaluate these estimates and update this loss accrual as necessary to take account of the results of those subleasing efforts and any changes that might occur in market rental rates or in commercial office space available for rent in the market where these facilities are located

the losses from discontinued operations for fiscal  consist of i losses of  from the operations of our discontinued businesses  including our jewelry authentication and grading businesses  incurred in the year ended june   and ii impairment losses of  recognized at june   to the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill of our jewelry businesses  partially offset by related income tax benefits recognized in fiscal the losses from discontinued operations for fiscal are primarily comprised of the loss from the operations of our jewelry businesses incurred during that year  partially offset by related income tax benefits recognized in fiscal quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following tables present unaudited selected quarterly financial data for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial information set forth below includes all adjustments consisting of normal adjustments and accruals that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent fiscal periods 
generally  the revenues generated by our collectibles grading and authentication businesses are lower during our second quarter  which ends on december  than in other quarterly periods  because collectibles commerce generally decreases during the holiday season 
our collectibles trade show business  which we acquired in july  has added to the variability in our quarter to quarter operating results  as its revenues vary based on the timing of the collectibles trade shows it conducts 
as a general matter  the revenues of this business are significantly higher in the first  third and fourth quarters of our fiscal years  compared to the second quarter  because the long beach collectibles shows the larger of the two trade shows that it conducts take place during the first  third and fourth quarters  while the smaller santa clara collectibles shows take place in the second and fourth quarters of the year

additionally  in we completed a public offering of  of our shares of common stock  of which the net cash proceeds to the company totaled approximately  we have used those proceeds primarily to fund business acquisitions  cash dividends and share repurchases and the expansion of our jewelry businesses  which we discontinued in fiscal in july  we used approximately  excluding expenses to purchase a total of  of our shares of common stock in a dutch auction tender offer see below 
cash flows 
cash flows from continuing operations 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  our operating activities from continuing operations generated cash of   and  respectively  reflecting income from continuing operations  as adjusted for non cash expenses including impairment losses  and changes in current assets and current liabilities  due to the timing of activities during those periods 
in addition  changes in deferred tax balances and the timing of income taxes receivables and payables impact our cash flows from continuing operating activities  although the level of such tax balances can be affected by the activities of our discontinued operations  because all tax balances whether as a result of continuing or discontinued operations are accounted for as part of continuing operations 
cash flows of discontinued operations 
discontinued operations used cash of   and  in the fiscal years ended june   and respectively 
in  cash used in discontinued operations consisted of  of losses arising from the discontinuance of the jewelry authentication and grading businesses  adjusted for i a non cash impairment loss of  ii the  long term operating lease accrual  discussed above  for the office facilities that had been occupied by those businesses prior to their closure  and iii non cash expenses and losses on disposal recognized in fiscal we expect that cash used by our discontinued operations will decline significantly in future periods  primarily because substantially all of the costs of discontinuing and exiting the jewelry businesses were recognized in fiscal however  there will continue to be cash obligations  consisting primarily of rents and related costs  payable under those facility leases 
see outstanding financial obligations discontinued operations below 
in fiscal and  cash used in discontinued operations consisted of the operating losses incurred by our jewelry authentication and grading businesses and our other discontinued businesses and capital expenditures incurred in support of those businesses

investing activities generated net cash of  during the year ended june   comprised primarily of i  of net cash generated from collections of notes evidencing loans that we made to collectibles dealers as part of our cfc dealer financing program  as we wound down that program by discontinuing new loans in the second half of the year  and ii  of cash generated from collection of receivables from discontinued operations and proceeds from the sales of net assets of discontinued operations  partially offset by capitalized software costs of  which declined significantly as compared to fiscal and because we completed our software development projects in by comparison  in fiscal investing activities used cash of  consisting primarily of net cash of  to fund dealer loans and  to fund capitalized software costs

cash used in financing activities 
in the fiscal years ended june   and  financing activities used net cash of   and  respectively  primarily to pay cash dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to a buyback program adopted by our board of directors 
the decline in cash used in financing activities in fiscal  as compared to the prior two fiscal years  was primarily due to a decision by our board of directors to suspend the payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of shares in order to preserve cash to fund the company s jewelry businesses and support our continuing operations in anticipation of the adverse impact of the economic recession and credit crisis on our cash flows 
outstanding financial obligations continuing operations 
in december  we extended the term of operating lease for our corporate headquarters to march that extension  which became effective in february  provided for i a reduction in the square footage leased by the company  ii a reduction in the base rental rate per square foot for the first four years of the term of the extended lease and iii a contribution by the landlord of up to  toward tenant improvements 
in accordance with gaap  the company recognizes the rent expense under this lease on a straight line basis over the rental period 
at june   we did not have any other material financial obligations in connection with our continuing operations 
the following tables set forth the amounts of our financial obligations  consisting primarily of rent expense  and sublease income  under operating leases for our continuing operations  in each of the years indicated below fiscal year net amount sublease income thereafter discontinued operations at june   we had the following financial obligations under operating leases  for two facilities leased in new york city  for our discontinued jewelry authentication and grading businesses  over the remaining duration of those leases which will expire in december  and fiscal year amount thereafter less estimated fair value of minimum lease payments accrued in fiscal  we recognized a loss of approximately  to establish an accrual for future rent obligations and related costs under these leases which  when added to an accrual for straight line rent recognized in periods prior to the discontinuance of the jewelry businesses  totaled  at june  the cash payment obligations under these two leases are to be paid in accordance with the schedule above 
at march   we recognized an initial operating lease accrual of  comprising an expense recognized of  and the balance straight lined rent recognized in prior periods for these two facilities based on our estimates of the time that it will take to sublease those facilities and the rents at which we could expect to sublease those facilities over the remaining duration of the leases  discounted to present value 
those estimates  in turn  were based primarily on rental market surveys that were conducted for us by an independent real estate valuation firm 
we have engaged a commercial real estate broker  familiar with the rental market in new york city  to seek subtenants for these facilities 
due to current economic conditions  there has been a substantial increase in available rental space in commercial buildings and a decline in market rental rates in new york city  which has increased the difficulties of subletting these facilities 
as a result  at june   we updated the estimates on which we had originally based our determination of the amount of the accrual for changes in conditions in the rental market  which caused us to increase the initial lease accrual by approximately  we will be re evaluating these estimates and updating this loss accrual as may become necessary to take account of the results of our subleasing efforts and any changes that might occur in market rental rates or in commercial office space available for rent in new york city where these facilities are located 
see critical accounting policies and estimates accrual for losses on facility leases above 
with the exception of these lease obligations for continuing and discontinued operations  we do not have any material financial obligations  such as long term debt or capital lease or purchase obligations 
dividends 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy that called for the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders  initially in the amount of per share 
that quarterly dividend rate was subsequently increased on two occasions by our board of directors and  during fiscal  we paid quarterly cash dividends of per common share for an expected annual cash dividend to stockholders of per common share 
as a result  we paid dividends totaling  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
as previously disclosed  the continued payment of cash dividends was subject to change or discontinuance based on a number of factors  including our financial performance and changes in market and financial conditions 
on september   the board of directors determined that  due to adverse market and economic conditions  including the liquidity crisis in the united states  the prudent course of action would be  and the board of directors voted  to suspend the future payment of cash dividends in order to preserve the company s cash resources to support the continued implementation of the company s strategic plan and the growth of its business 
at the same time  the board of directors approved a stock dividend on the company s outstanding shares  and it declared this stock dividend will be distributed on november  to all stockholders of record on october  during fiscal  prior to suspension of dividend payments  we paid dividends to our stockholders totaling  share buyback program 
in december  our board of directors approved a stock buyback program that authorized up to  of stock repurchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities exchange commission sec rules  when opportunities to make such repurchases  at attractive prices  become available 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we repurchased a total of   and  shares  respectively  of our common stock under this program for aggregate purchase prices of approximately   and  respectively excluding transaction costs 
we continue to have a total of million available for share purchases under the share buyback program 
dutch auction tender offer 
on june   we commenced a modified dutch auction tender offer for the purpose of purchasing  for cash  up to  shares of our common stock at a price  per share  of not less than and not greater than 
the principal purpose of the tender offer was to enhance stockholder value by providing our stockholders with greater investment liquidity by giving them the opportunity to sell all or a substantial number of their shares in the tender offer 
additionally  our decision to discontinue and cease expenditures for our jewelry authentication and grading businesses  meant that cash which otherwise would have been used in those businesses was available to fund the repurchase of shares in the tender offer 
the tender offer  which expired on july   was oversubscribed and we purchased a total  shares in the tender offer  at a price of per share  resulting in an aggregate purchase price of approximately  not including the fees and expenses incurred in conducting the tender offer 
future uses and sources of cash 
we plan to use our cash resources  consisting of available cash and cash equivalent balances  together with internally generated cash flows  to i introduce new collectibles related services for our customers  ii fund working capital requirements  and iii fund obligations associated with our discontinued businesses  and for other general corporate purposes 
in addition  because we expect that our continuing operations will generate positive cash flow in the future  we plan to consider other uses for our available cash that we believe will enhance stockholder value  which could include the resumption of cash dividends or additional buybacks of shares 
although we have no current plans to do so  we also may seek borrowings and we may issue additional shares of our stock to finance the growth of our collectibles businesses 
however  due to the economic recession and the credit crisis in the united states  there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such borrowings or generate additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all
