overview we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products 
our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement  storage  treatment and enjoyment of water 
our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets  designing and manufacturing standard  modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components  thermal management products  and accessories 
in  we expect our water group and technical products group to generate approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately million in to approximately billion in we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target market totaling billion 
our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement  storage  treatment and enjoyment of water 
on february   we sold our national pool tile npt business to pool corporation in a cash transaction 
the results of npt have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of npt have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
on june   we entered into a transaction with ge water process technologies a unit of general electric company ge that was accounted for as an acquisition of an percent ownership interest in ge s global water softener and residential water filtration business in exchange for a percent interest in our global water softener and residential water filtration business 
the acquisition was effected through the formation of two new entities  collectively  pentair residential filtration or prf a us entity and an international entity  into which we and ge contributed certain assets  properties  liabilities and operations representing our respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses 
we are an percent owner of the new entities and ge is a percent owner 
with the formation of pentair residential filtration  we believe we will be better positioned to serve residential customers with industry leading technical applications in the areas of water conditioning  whole house filtration  point of use water management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate revenue growth by selling ge s existing residential conditioning products through our sales channels 
on december   we sold our spa and bath spa bath business to balboa water group in a cash transaction 
the results of spa bath have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of spa bath have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as defense  security  medical and networking 
we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america for enclosures and the highest brand recognition in the industry in north america 
from mid through  the technical products group experienced 
table of contents significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and over capacity and weak demand in the data communication and telecommunication markets 
from through  sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors  new products  price increases and higher demand in targeted markets 
key trends and uncertainties the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in and will likely impact our results in and beyond many markets we serve have slowed dramatically as a result of the tumultuous credit markets and the resulting recession 
we have identified specific product and geographic markets we serve that we believe will stagnate  contract or continue contracting in  as noted below 
we have begun and expect to continue to restructure our operations serving those markets to close facilities in order to reduce or relocate capacity  to reduce labor and material costs  to optimize our manufacturing footprint and to simplify our business structure 
we have also identified specific markets in which we participate that we believe will continue to grow over this period and are selectively reinforcing our businesses in these markets 
because our businesses are significantly affected by general economic trends  further deterioration in our most important markets addressed below would likely have an adverse impact on our results of operation for and beyond 
new home building and new pool starts have contracted for each of the past three years in the united states and have started to slow significantly in europe as well 
we believe that construction of new homes and new pool starts in north america affect approximately of sales of our water businesses  while repair  replacement and refurbishment accounts for approximately of sales in these businesses 
we expect the current recession to continue to adversely impact our sales for all or a significant portion of as sales of products into domestic residential end markets in our water group business continued to slow appreciably  we have reduced our investments in businesses in those markets  and further restructured our operations by closing or downsizing facilities  reducing headcount and taking other market related actions 
industrial  communications and commercial markets for all of our businesses  including commercial and industrial construction  have also slowed significantly during the fourth quarter of  especially in december  and this weakness has continued throughout the early part of the first quarter of we have a high level of uncertainty over the course of the economy and hence the strength of many of our significant markets both in the united states and around the world for the balance of the year and beyond 
we have reduced our investments in businesses in these markets  and further restructured our operations by closing or downsizing facilities  reducing headcount and taking other market related actions 
we experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses during to offset this inflation  we implemented productivity improvements and selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate inflationary cost increases we experienced in base materials such as carbon steel  copper and resins and other costs such as health care and other employee benefit costs 
we expect the current economic environment will result in price volatility for many of our raw materials  material costs have declined in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  and we believe they will continue to decline so long as general economic conditions remain weak 
we believe that these cost decreases we are experiencing will not begin to be fully realized in our results of operations until the second quarter of as a result of the dramatic fall in securities and other investment markets over  our unfunded pension liability increased from fiscal year end to fiscal year end from million to million  or an increase of million primarily reflecting our reduced investment return and significantly lower asset values in our us defined benefit plans during we believe that this will increase our pension expense in over year earlier levels  and more significantly  require an increase in our contributions to the plans to approximately million  an increase of over million in the year 

table of contents we have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds conversion of our net income 
we define free cash flow as cash flow from continuing operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of property and equipment 
free cash flow for the full year was approximately million  or of our net income 
our target for free cash flow in remains at of net income  and we have instituted several measures internally to maintain our strong collection experience and to decrease our working capital 
see our discussion of other financial measures under the caption liquidity and capital resources in this report 
we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group 
end user demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is normally at seasonal highs from april to august 
the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale early buy programs generally including extended payment terms and or additional discounts 
demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by economic conditions and weather patterns  particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 
while we believe that this seasonality will continue in the second and third quarters of  due to the unknown impact of the current economic situation  we are uncertain of the size and impact of the seasonal spike for the year  and contemplate that any seasonal impact will likely be less than in prior years 
we experienced year over year favorable foreign currency effects on net sales and operating results in and the first nine months of  due to the weakening of the us dollar in relation to other foreign currencies 
our currency effect is primarily for the us dollar against the euro  which may or may not trend favorably in the future 
on june   we formed pentair residential filtration in order to expand our product lines  accelerate opportunities to provide our customers complete water filtration systems  increase revenue growth and exploit cost synergy opportunities 
the one time gain on the transaction increased diluted earnings per share  on an after tax basis  by cents in the second quarter of integration and inventory step up costs arising out of the formation of the prf business amounted to approximately million in we believe we will continue to incur integration costs as we combine facilities in this business throughout most of the effective income tax rate for was 
we estimate our effective tax rate for the full year to be between and 
we continue to actively pursue initiatives to reduce our effective tax rate 
the tax rate in any quarter can be affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution 
outlook in  our operating objectives include the following restructuring our operations in challenging markets while investing in more favorable markets and geographies  increasing our vertical market focus within each of our global business units to grow in those markets in which we have competitive advantages  driving operating excellence through lean enterprise initiatives  with special focus on sourcing and supply management  cash flow management  and lean operations  stressing proactive talent development  particularly in international management and other key functional areas  and completing integration of the newly formed prf business and prior acquisitions  and realizing identified synergistic opportunities 
on february   we announced our results of operations for fiscal year and modified our earnings guidance for the first quarter of to a range of to per share on a diluted basis 
our prior guidance for the first quarter of  given in december  was a range of to per share 
our 
table of contents revised outlook for the quarter is based on what we believe will be a continuation of the order rates and level of economic activity realized in december and january lasting throughout the first quarter 
in december  we also initiated earnings guidance for the year that anticipated our earnings to be approximately to per share on a diluted basis 
this guidance has not been withdrawn or modified because we do not have sufficient certainty at this time to support any revision 
we do caution  however  that we are uncertain of the economic performance trajectory  both in the united states and globally  for the calendar year 
as noted above  significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our primary markets and geographies beyond what we have seen to date in the first quarter would adversely impact our revenues and financial performance 
this outlook is based on several variables 
first  our guidance anticipates revenue declines in our businesses throughout of approximately as a result of overall market conditions  bringing our total revenue to approximately billion for the full year 
second  we expect to get the benefit in the second  third and fourth quarters of of restructuring and other market related expense reduction efforts taken during and early in third  we anticipate that our manufacturing productivity initiatives  in particular our materials sourcing programs  will improve through our lean enterprise initiatives and commodity deflation 
we have heightened our focus on increasing the conversion of our net income into free cash flow from that achieved in in addition  in response to continuing turbulence in the credit markets  we are taking actions we believe will help maintain our liquidity and increase our capital resources by allowing us to repay indebtedness at a faster rate than would otherwise be the case 
we do not intend to implement our stock buyback program for  as we have in the past  nor do we currently intend to make any significant cash acquisitions until credit markets and business conditions stabilize 
if economic conditions worsen in north america and europe  then we expect that our sales  manufacturing productivity and cash flow may deteriorate from the current forecast 
in that event  we would further reduce discretionary capital spending and selling  marketing and r d costs as well as accelerate our restructuring actions in order to minimize the impact of these declines on our earnings per share 
conversely  if economic conditions hold up and improve over the year we would then have the flexibility to increase expenditures in our selling  marketing and r d efforts to maximize organic sales growth in favorable markets in and to anticipate growth in our guidance assumes an absence of significant acquisitions or divestitures in in  we may seek to expand our geographic reach internationally  expand our presence in our various channels to market and acquire technologies and products to broaden our businesses capabilities to serve additional markets 
we may also consider the divestiture or closure of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their most attractive markets 
the ability to achieve our operating objectives and guidance will depend  to a certain extent  on factors outside our control

we have grown our businesses in significant part over the past few years through acquisitions  such as jung pump and porous media in  financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and  from time to time  by private or public debt issuance 
our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes  although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions  these are temporary loans that have in the past been repaid within less than a year 
in light of the current global economic situation and the state of credit markets generally  we have instituted a more conservative financial policy

we are authorized to sell short term commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility 
we use the credit facility as back up liquidity to support of commercial paper outstanding

investment grade is a credit rating of bbb or higher by standard poor s or baa or higher by moody s 
on march   standard poor s ratings services revised its current rating outlook on us from stable to negative 
at the same time  standard poor s affirmed its long term debt rating of bbb 
standard poor s stated that the outlook revision reflects the additional leverage and stress on credit metrics that would result from the acquisition of porous media 
the negative outlook indicates the rating could be lowered if financial policies become more aggressive or if operating results are weaker than expected 
we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not material to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt 
a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation  a specific class of financial obligations  or a specific financial program 
the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors  insurers  or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated 
the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or long term rating 
it focuses on identifiable events and short term trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies 
a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable 
prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 
we issue short term commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard poor s or moody s 
even though our short term commercial paper is unrated  we believe a downgrade in our long term debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 
we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long term debt by either standard poor s or moody s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets 
however  depending upon market conditions  the amount  timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected 
if both of our long term debt ratings were downgraded to below bbb baa  our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 
we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest and service debt  and to pay dividends to shareholders 
in order to meet these cash requirements  we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds  and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities

we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months 
we are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the non current fin obligations 
other financial measures in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating  investing  and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income 
we have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds conversion of net income 
free cash flow and conversion of net income are non gaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance 
we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt 
in addition  free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation based incentives 
our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing operations twelve months ended december in thousands cash flow provided by used for continuing operations capital expenditures proceeds from sale of property and equipment free cash flow net income conversion of net income

commitments and contingencies environmental we have been named as defendants  targets  or prp in a small number of environmental clean ups  in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status 
to date  none of these claims have resulted in clean up costs  fines  penalties  or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations 
we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases  such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in  the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in  the disposition of lincoln industrial in  and the disposition of the tools group in  we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations 
we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities 
we settled some of the claims in prior years  to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 
in addition  there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites  including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in  which relate to operations no longer carried out at the sites 
we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites 
we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 
we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  for both divested and acquired businesses 
when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with gaap in the united states 
as of december  and  our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately million and million  respectively 
we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental clean up costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 
stand by letters of credit in the ordinary course of business  we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non performance 
the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog 
in addition  we issue financial stand by letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under self insurance programs and certain legal matters 
as of december  and  the outstanding value of these instruments totaled million and million  respectively
