item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview and recent developments brightpoint  inc is a global leader in the distribution of wireless devices and accessories and provision of customized logistic services to the wireless industry 
we have operations centers and or sales offices in various countries including australia  austria  belgium  colombia  denmark  finland  france  germany  guatemala  india  italy  the netherlands  new zealand  norway  poland  portugal  russia  singapore  slovakia  south africa  spain  sweden  switzerland  turkey  the united arab emirates and the united states 
we provide customized integrated logistic services including procurement  inventory management  software loading  kitting and customized packaging  fulfillment  credit services and receivables management  call center and activation services  website hosting  e fulfillment solutions and other services within the global wireless industry 
our customers include mobile network operators  mobile virtual network operators mvnos  resellers  retailers and wireless equipment manufacturers 
we distribute wireless communication devices and we provide value added distribution and logistic services for wireless products manufactured by companies such as high tech computer corp  kyocera  lg electronics  motorola  nokia  samsung  siemens  sony ericsson and utstarcom 
we measure our performance by focusing on certain key performance indicators such as the number of wireless devices handled  gross margin by service line  operating income  cash flow  cash conversion cycle  and liquidity 
we also use return on invested capital roic and return on tangible capital rotc to measure the effectiveness of the use of invested capital and tangible capital 
we manage our business based on two distinct service lines which include product distribution and logistic services 
during  wireless devices sold through distribution declined by  and wireless devices handled through logistic services increased by 
our distribution gross margin increased by percentage points to  and our logistic services gross margin increased by percentage points to 
we are focused on increasing the total volume of wireless devices handled as opposed to increasing volume in one specific service line as we believe that both service lines provide a reasonable return in relation to the capital invested and the risk assumed 
the total number of wireless devices handled by us grew by from revenues grew by to billion 
the increases in wireless devices handled and revenues were primarily due to the impact of the dangaard telecom acquisition in july and the cellstar acquisition in march excluding these acquisitions  revenue decreased  primarily due to a decrease in wireless devices handled and average selling price brought on by a global economic slowdown in the second half of wireless devices handled also decreased due to the sale of certain assets in colombia in the first quarter of loss from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share 
as a result of our annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill allocated to our europe  middle east  and africa emea reporting unit was impaired  which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was approved by our board of directors in february net loss was million  or per diluted share in significant developments and events in include debt reduction 
for  cash flows from operations increased million to million 
we used cash flows from operations as well as cash on hand to pay down debt by million during as of december   we had total liquidity unrestricted cash and unused borrowing availability of million compared to million at december  total debt outstanding was million at december  goodwill impairment charge 
goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
during the fourth quarter of  there were severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity which had significant adverse impacts on stock markets and on the outlook for the wireless industry  both of which contributed to a significant decline in brightpoint s stock price and corresponding market capitalization 
the result of our annual goodwill impairment test was that the carrying amount of the net assets allocated to the europe  middle east  and africa emea reporting unit exceeded the fair market value 
the entire amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit was impaired  which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was approved by our board of directors in february the goodwill allocated to the emea reporting unit is primarily related to the july acquisition of dangaard telecom 
the impairment charge resulted from factors driven by current market conditions including lower market valuation multiples for similar assets  higher discount rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity markets  and current cash flow forecasts for the emea markets in which we operate 
the impairment will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
realignment of european operations 
on june  we announced that as part of the natural progression of the dangaard integration process  we were realigning our european operations in an effort to streamline our business processes and optimize our business model 
we believe that these efforts  and the resultant cost reductions and operational efficiencies  will help produce additional synergies for us 
we incurred restructuring costs of million for the year ended december  related to these initiatives  which are included as restructuring charge in the consolidated statement of operations 
spending and debt reduction plan 
in february  we announced a plan to reduce spending in by to million and to reduce average daily debt by approximately million to million in the spending and debt reduction plan 
the highlights of this plan are eliminate senior executive officers cash bonuses brightpoint senior executive officers have voluntarily elected to waive their cash incentive compensation opportunities 
reduce staff bonuses cash incentive compensation opportunities for non executives will be suspended for the first half of freeze base pay employees base salary will be frozen except adjustments required by law or other special circumstances 
impose general hiring freeze the company has implemented a general hiring freeze 
reduce global workforce the company will reduce its global workforce by at least positions  or approximately 
this is in addition to the approximate reduction in workforce announced in june debt reduction the company expects to reduce average daily debt outstanding by million to million in through improvements in working capital 
working capital improvements will come through reducing aged inventory and receivables  renegotiating customer and vendor terms  and renegotiating of under performing programs channels or terminating those programs if satisfactory returns are not met

in the second half of the year  a strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies allowed traders from other regions to sell wireless devices into the markets served by our singapore business primarily the middle east at prices lower than those available to us 
the decrease in average selling price for the year ended december  was driven by our singapore business as a result of a shift in mix to lower priced handsets due to a shift in market demand as well as lower availability of higher priced devices 
this decrease in average selling price in singapore was partially offset by an increase in average selling price in our australia business due to a higher mix of converged devices sold compared to the prior year

excluding the dangaard telecom operations  distribution revenue in our europe division was estimated to have decreased when assuming that revenue from legacy brightpoint operations in overlapping countries germany  norway  and sweden remained constant from the year ended december  the decrease in average selling price was due to a shift in demand to lower priced handsets in europe compared to the prior year 
the increase in logistic services revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to the acquisition of dangaard telecom 
in order to conform to brightpoint accounting policies and us gaap  dangaard telecom changed its revenue recognition for arrangements where dangaard telecom serves as the agent in the transaction 
the revenue from these arrangements is included in logistic services revenue 
excluding the dangaard telecom operations  logistic services revenue in our europe division increased due to an increase in revenue from the sale of prepaid airtime in sweden as well as an increase in revenue from non handset based logistic services agreements from the re launch of our middle east based business in which we resumed operations in august gross profit and gross margin year ended december  of of total total change amounts in s distribution logistic services gross profit distribution points logistic services points gross margin points the percentage point increase in gross margin for the year ended december  was driven by both a percentage point increase in gross margin from our distribution business and a percentage point increase in gross margin from our logistic services business 
the increases in gross profit and gross margin from logistic services were driven by incremental logistic services gross profit and gross margin from the dangaard telecom operations as well the impact of conforming dangaard telecom to brightpoint accounting policies 
in addition  gross margin from logistic services was positively impacted by an improved cost structure resulting from the impact of spending reductions in our north america operations

sg a expenses included million and million of non cash stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  and  respectively 
amortization expense amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in amortization expense relates to finite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the cellstar and dangaard telecom transactions in we allocated the purchase price of the dangaard telecom and cellstar acquisitions based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the assets acquired in connection with the dangaard telecom transaction included million of finite lived intangible assets assigned to the customer relationships as of july  the acquired finite lived intangible assets have a useful life of approximately fifteen years and are being amortized over the period that the assets are expected to contribute to our future cash flows 
the assets are being amortized on an accelerated method based on the projected cash flows used for valuation purposes 
we believe that these cash flows are most reflective of the pattern in which the economic benefit of the finite lived intangible assets will be consumed

the decrease in average selling price in our asia pacific division was also driven by our singapore business as a result of a significant increase in sales of lower priced handsets due to market demand for these handsets

excluding the dangaard telecom operations  distribution revenue in our europe division increased 
the increase in handset based volume excluding the dangaard telecom operations was primarily due to an increase in wireless devices sold by our finland and slovakia operations

the increase in distribution gross margin was primarily driven by a shift in mix toward higher margin distribution business in europe resulting from the acquisition of dangaard telecom 
the increase in gross margin in our emea division was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin in our asia pacific division due to sales of the slow moving inventory within asia at lower prices in an effort to improve sell through of these devices 
the decrease in asia pacific gross margin was partially offset by an increase in gross margin on devices sold to customers served by our singapore business 
distribution gross margin in our singapore business was significantly higher than historical levels during the second half of as a result of a strong product line up from our largest supplier as well as favorable product allocations

the increase in operating income from continuing operations in our asia pacific division for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in the volume of devices sold to customers served by our singapore business previously served by our brightpoint asia limited business as a result of improved product availability at competitive prices and new products launched by our suppliers 
distribution gross margin in our singapore business was significantly higher than historical levels during the second half of as a result of a strong product line up from our largest supplier as well as favorable product allocations 
this was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin in our asia pacific division due to sales of the slow moving inventory within asia at lower prices in an effort to improve sell through of these devices 
there can be no assurances that we will continue to experience similar margins or as favorable product allocations in our singapore business in the future 
the increase in operating income from continuing operations in our emea division was primarily due to the acquisition of dangaard telecom  which significantly expanded our operations in europe 
operating loss from continuing operations in our corporate headquarters increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase in operating loss was due to a million increase in personnel costs primarily due to an increase in headcount in support of overall growth and incentive compensation as well as million of incremental costs associated with integrating the dangaard telecom acquisition

income tax expense income tax expense for the year ended december  is net of a million benefit resulting from a reduction in the statutory tax rate in germany as well as a million benefit related to the reversal of valuation allowances on certain foreign tax credit carryforwards 
based on taxable income and utilization of prior net operating loss carryforwards  it became more likely than not during the second quarter of that we will be able to utilize these foreign tax credits prior to their expiration 
excluding the impact of these benefits  our effective tax rate would have been for the year ended december   primarily due to a shift in mix of income between jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated statement of cash flows we use the indirect method of preparing and presenting our statements of cash flows 
in our opinion  it is more practical than the direct method and provides the reader with a good perspective and analysis of our cash flows 
year ended december  change amounts in s net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million in  a change of million compared to prior year primarily due to million more cash provided by working capital in compared to the prior year 
cash provided by working capital was million for year ended december  partially offset by million more cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities in compared to the prior year 
net cash used for investing activities was million for  a decrease of million compared to prior year primarily due to million less cash used for acquisitions during due primarily to the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities related to the us operations and the miami based latin america business of cellstar corporation in net cash used in financing activities was million  a change of million compared to prior year primarily due to million cash used for repayments of long term debt compared to proceeds from long term debt of million in the prior year primarily related to debt assumed in the acquisition of dangaard telecom 
cash conversion cycle year ended december  days sales outstanding in accounts receivable days inventory on hand days payable outstanding cash conversion cycle days our calculation of the cash conversion cycle for the year ended december  has not been adjusted to include pro forma results of operations for the us operations and the miami based latin america business of cellstar corporation and pro forma results of operations for dangaard telecom 
as a result  our cash conversion cycle days for are higher primarily due to the fact that daily sales and cost of products sold do not include a full year of sales and cost of products sold for these acquisitions 
a key source of our liquidity is our ability to invest in inventory  sell the inventory to our customers  collect cash from our customers and pay our suppliers 
we refer to this as the cash conversion cycle 
the cash conversion cycle is measured by the number of days it takes to effect the cycle of investing in inventory  selling the inventory  paying suppliers and collecting cash from customers 
the components in the cash conversion cycle are days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  days inventory on hand  and days payables outstanding 
the cash conversion cycle  as we measure it  is the netting of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable and days inventory on hand with the days of payable outstanding 
circumstances when the cash conversion cycle decreases generally generate cash for the company 
conversely  circumstances when the cash conversion cycle increases generally consume cash in the form of additional investment in working capital 
during  the cash conversion cycle decreased to days from days in the decrease in the cash conversion cycle was driven by an overall improvement in inventory levels as well as improved collections of accounts receivable 
the detail calculation of the components of the cash conversion cycle is as follows a days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ending accounts receivable for continuing operations divided by average daily revenue inclusive of value added taxes for foreign operations for the period 
b days inventory on hand ending inventory for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period 
c days payables outstanding ending accounts payable for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period

borrowings the table below summarizes borrowing capacity that was available to us as of december  in thousands letters of credit net gross availability outstanding guarantees availability global term loans global credit facility other total in january we made additional principal payments of approximately million on our global term loans 
with these payments  we have no required principal payments on our global term loans until april liquidity analysis we measure liquidity as the total of unrestricted cash and unused borrowing availability  and we use this measurement as an indicator of how much access to cash we have to either grow the business through investment in new markets  acquisitions  or through expansion of existing service or product lines or to contend with adversity such as unforeseen operating losses potentially caused by reduced demand for our products and services  material uncollectible accounts receivable  or material inventory write downs  as examples 
the table below shows our liquidity calculation 
december  change amounts in s unrestricted cash unused borrowing availability liquidity at december  we were in compliance with the covenants in each of our material credit agreements 
our credit agreements contain two financial covenants that are sensitive to significant fluctuations in earnings a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter  and is calculated as total debt including guarantees and letters of credit divided by trailing twelve month bank adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization bank adjusted ebitda 
it may not exceed at the end of any fiscal quarter 
as of december   our leverage ratio was the interest coverage ratio is also calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter  and is calculated as trailing twelve month bank adjusted ebitda divided by trailing twelve month net cash interest expense 
the interest coverage ratio may not fall below as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
as of december   our interest coverage ratio was we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants throughout however  there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty regarding the current economic downturn and the impact it will have on the wireless device industry during due to this uncertainty  there is always the possibility that economy will decline faster than we can react with spending and debt reduction  which increases the risk of not complying with our debt covenants 
we expect the spending reductions and debt reductions we achieved in  combined with our spending and debt reduction plan  will allow us to be in compliance with these debt covenants in however  if we are not able to reduce spending or debt enough to offset a significant unforeseen decline in market conditions  there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance throughout the next four fiscal quarters 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and capital expenditures were primarily related to investments in our information technology infrastructure and software upgrades as well as equipment and leasehold improvements for new facilities 
expenditures for capital resources historically have been composed of information systems  leasehold improvements and warehouse equipment 
we expect this pattern to continue in future periods 
a key component of our strategic plan is geographic expansion 
we expect our level of capital expenditures to be affected by our geographic expansion activity 
we believe that existing capital resources and cash flows provided by future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations and our planned operations including capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our unused borrowing availability will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we have agreements with unrelated third parties for the factoring of specific accounts receivable in our spain and germany operations in order to reduce the amount of working capital required to fund such receivables 
our credit agreement permits the factoring of up to million of receivables in our operations outside of the us the factoring of accounts receivable under these agreements are accounted for as sales in accordance with sfas  transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and accordingly  are accounted for as off balance sheet arrangements 
proceeds on the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount 
the discount is recorded as a charge in interest  net in the consolidated statement of operations in the period of the sale 
net funds received reduced accounts receivable outstanding while increasing cash 
we are the collection agent on behalf of the third parties for these arrangements and have no significant retained interests or servicing liabilities related to the accounts receivable that we have sold 
at december   we had sold million of accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
fees paid under these programs were million for the year ended december  we have been notified that the factoring agreement in germany will terminate in the middle of at this time  we are attempting to replace this agreement with a similar factoring agreement  however there can be no assurances that we will be successful 
a new agreement may contain higher fees  which would increase the amount of bank adjusted ebitda required to remain in compliance with our interest coverage ratio 
contractual obligations and commitments our disclosures regarding cash requirements of contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than to to total year years years thereafter amounts in s operating leases total borrowings interest on third party debt and lines of credit purchase obligations pension obligation letters of credit total interest on third party debt is calculated based on the interest rate as of december  and repayments of outstanding debt in accordance with our credit agreement 
interest does not include the effects of any prepayments of borrowings permitted under the credit agreement 
prepayments could significantly decrease interest obligations in future years 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
in january we made additional principal payments of approximately million on our global term loans 
with these payments  we have no required principal payments on our global term loans until april critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period as new information becomes available  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical based on the criteria above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements in any one period 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with sfas we use tax planning to minimize or defer tax liabilities to future periods 
in recording effective tax rates and related liabilities and assets  we rely upon estimates  which are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more or less taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize internal and external skilled resources in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of tax expense and related liabilities 
for interim periods  we accrue our tax provision at the effective tax rate that we expect for the full year 
as the actual results from our various businesses vary from our estimates earlier in the year  we adjust the succeeding interim period s effective tax rates to reflect our best estimate for the year to date results and for the full year 
as part of the effective tax rate  if we determine that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized  we will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at the expected realizable value 
at december   total deferred tax assets were million  net of million of valuation allowances 
goodwill and long lived asset impairment we assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
we perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter 
in our impairment analysis we estimate the fair value of an enterprise based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  there were severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity which had significant adverse impacts on stock markets and on the outlook for the wireless industry  both of which contributed to a significant decline in brightpoint s stock price and corresponding market capitalization 
the result of our annual goodwill impairment test was that the carrying amount of the net assets allocated to the emea reporting unit exceeded the fair market value 
the entire amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit was impaired  which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was approved by our board of directors in february the goodwill allocated to the emea reporting unit is primarily related to the july acquisition of dangaard telecom 
the impairment charge resulted from factors impacted by current market conditions including lower market valuation multiples for similar assets  higher discount rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity markets  and current cash flow forecasts for the emea markets in which we operate 
the impairment will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
based on the impairment analysis for the americas and asia pacific reporting units in the fourth quarter of  we determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill allocated to those reporting units 
a change in the anticipated future cash flows for either reporting unit would not have resulted in any additional impairment 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we test our long lived assets for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets recoverability testing  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
the goodwill impairment of the emea reporting unit was an indicator that the carrying amount of the long lived assets of that reporting unit might not be recoverable 
we performed a recoverability test in the fourth quarter of based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the long lived assets and determined that they were not impaired 
a change in the estimated undiscounted cash flows would not have resulted in any impairment 
our spending and debt reduction plan may result in the exiting of lower profitability programs if we are unsuccessful in renegotiating the terms of the programs that do not currently meet our requirements for returns on invested capital 
exiting these programs might result in future impairment charges for the related long lived assets 
seasonality we are subject to seasonal patterns that generally affect the wireless device industry 
wireless devices are generally used by businesses  governments and consumers 
for businesses and governments  purchasing behavior is affected by fiscal year ends  while consumers are affected by holiday gift giving seasons 
for the global wireless device industry  seasonal patterns for wireless device units handled have been as follows year st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter the industry data above is based on company and industry analyst estimates 
the seasonal patterns for wireless devices handled by us have been as follows year st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter our calculation of seasonality for the year ended december  has not been adjusted to include pro forma results of operations for the us operations and the miami based latin america business of cellstar corporation and pro forma results of operations for dangaard telecom 
forward looking and cautionary statements certain information in this form k may contain forward looking statements regarding future events or the future performance of the company 
these risk factors include  without limitation  uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments  including  without limitation  i the current economic downturn could cause a severe disruption in our operations  ii fluctuations in regional demand patterns and economic factors could harm our operations  iii our debt facilities could prevent us from borrowing additional funds  if needed  iv collections of our accounts receivable  v our reliance on suppliers to provide trade credit facilities to adequately fund our on going operations and product purchases  vi a significant percentage of our revenues are generated outside of the united states in countries that may have volatile currencies or other risks  vii the loss or reduction in orders from principal customers or a reduction in the prices we are able to charge these customers could cause our revenues to decline and impair our cash flows  viii the impact that seasonality may have on our business and results  ix we buy a significant amount of our products from a limited number of suppliers  and they may not provide us with competitive products at reasonable prices when we need them in the future  x our business could be harmed by consolidation of mobile operators  xi we make significant investments in the technology used in our business and rely on that technology to function effectively without interruptions  xii the fact that a substantial number of shares are eligible for future sale by dangaard holding and the sale of those shares could adversely affect our stock price  xiii our future operating results will depend on our ability to continue to increase volumes and maintain margins  xiv our ability to expand and implement our future growth strategy  including acquisitions  xv uncertainty regarding whether wireless equipment manufacturers and wireless network operators will continue to outsource aspects of their business to us  xvi our reliance upon third parties to manufacture products which we distribute and reliance upon their quality control procedures  xvii rapid technological changes in the wireless communications and data industry  xviii effect of natural disasters  epidemics  hostilities or terrorist attacks on our operations  xix intense industry competition  xx our ability to manage and sustain future growth at our historical or current rates  xxi our ability to continue to enter into relationships and financing that may provide us with minimal returns or losses on our investments  xxii our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel  cost of complying with labor agreements and high rate of personnel turnover  xxiii protecting our proprietary information  xxiv our obligations under certain debt  lease and other contractual arrangements  xxv our dependence on our computer and communications systems  xxvi uncertainty regarding future volatility in our common stock price  xxvii potential dilution to existing shareholders from the issuance of securities under our long term incentive plans 
because of the aforementioned uncertainties affecting our future operating results  past performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate intend  likely  will  should and plan and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date that such statement was made 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
we maintain cash investments primarily in aaa rated money market mutual funds and overnight repurchase agreements  which have minimal credit risk 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 
in many circumstances  we have obtained credit insurance to mitigate our credit risk 
exchange rate risk management a substantial portion of our revenue and expenses are transacted in markets worldwide and may be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to reduce  but not eliminate  unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates by hedging 
generally  through the purchase of forward contracts  we hedge transactional currency risk  but do not hedge foreign currency revenue or future operating income 
also  we do not hedge our investment in foreign subsidiaries  where fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our comprehensive income or loss 
an adverse change defined as a strengthening of the us dollar in all exchange rates  relative to our foreign currency risk management program  would have had no material impact on our results of operations for or at december   we had no cash flow or net investment hedges open 
our sensitivity analysis of foreign currency exchange rate movements does not factor in a potential change in volumes or local currency prices of our products sold or services provided 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed above 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed and variable rate debt 
to mitigate interest rate risks  we utilize interest rate swaps to convert certain portions of our variable rate debt to fixed interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our borrowing arrangements 
our risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
we use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
at december   swaps with a total notional amount of million were outstanding 
these swaps have maturity dates ranging from these derivative instruments are designated as hedges under sfas changes in market value  when effective  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
amounts are recorded to interest expense as settled 
a increase in short term borrowing rates during the quarter would have resulted in only a nominal increase in interest expense 
the fair value liability associated with those swaps was million at december
