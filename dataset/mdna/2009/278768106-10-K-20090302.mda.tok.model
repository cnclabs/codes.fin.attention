item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december   and cash flows from operating activities 
we typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business 
for the year ended december   we reported net cash flows from operating activities of million 
for the years ended december  and  we reported cash outflows from operating activities of million and million  respectively 
the million improvement in net cash inflows from operating activities during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to a million increase in net income  adjusted to exclude non cash changes in i impairments of goodwill  indefinite lived and long lived assets ii unrealized gains losses on investments accounted for at fair value  net  iii depreciation and amortization expense  iv unrealized and realized gains losses on marketable investment securities and other investments  and v deferred tax expense benefit 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  including a million increase in net receivables from dish network  partially offset by an increase in cash inflows related to changes in accounts payable of million and in accrued expenses of million 
prior to the spin off  our operating cash flows did not necessarily reflect what our operating cash flow would have been as a separate company as our historical operations did not include our satellite services business and our equipment sales were provided to dish network at cost 
the increase in net cash outflows from operating activities during the year ended december  compared to the same period in of million resulted from the million increase in net loss 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  capital expenditures and strategic investments 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from a net increase in purchases of marketable investment securities  an increase in cash used for purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by a decrease in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments  including the effect of the acquisition of sling media 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from an increase in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments  including sling media and an increase in cash used for purchases of property and equipment 
cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities generally include cash used for payment of capital lease obligations  mortgages or other notes payable  and repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the years ended december   and we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the decrease in net cash inflow from financing activities from to of million principally resulted from the repurchase of common stock of million  repayment of debt of million and a million decrease in advances from owner  partially offset by the million contribution from dish network in connection with the spin off 
the increase in net cash inflow from financing activities from to of million principally resulted from the increase in advances from owner of million 
obligations and future capital requirements contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangement future maturities of our contractual obligations are summarized as follows payments due by period total thereafter in thousands satellite related obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations mortgages and other notes payable other long term obligations total future commitments related to satellites  including one satellite launch contract  is included in the table above under satellite related obligations 
in certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites 
dish mexico 
in november  we entered into a joint venture for direct to home  or dth  service in mexico through several arrangements that provide us an approximate indirect economic interest in dish mexico  s 
de rl de rl  or dish mexico 
in accordance with the terms of the arrangements  we provide certain broadcast services and transponder services and may sell hardware such as digital set top boxes and related equipment to dish mexico 
subject to a number of conditions  including regulatory approvals and compliance with various other arrangements  we committed to provide approximately million of value over an initial ten year period 
the remaining commitments as of december  owed pursuant to the agreement are included in the table above 
of the total commitment  approximately million is expected to be paid in cash and the remaining amounts may be satisfied in the form of cash  certain services or equipment 
as of december   we had invested approximately million of cash and contributed equipment in dish mexico 
in general  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
interest on long term debt we have periodic cash interest payment requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities as follows payments due by period total thereafter in thousands mortgages and notes payable capital lease obligations total 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued satellite related obligations satellites under construction 
we have contracts to lease capacity on two satellites currently under construction which are expected to be completed between and future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table captioned contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements under satellite related obligations 
nimiq in march  we entered into a fifteen year satellite service agreement with bell tv to lease dbs transponders on nimiq  a canadian dbs satellite 
nimiq is expected to be launched in the second half of and will operate at the degree orbital location 
quetzsat in november  we entered into a ten year satellite service agreement with ses latin america sa ses to lease all of the capacity on quetzsat quetzsat is expected to be launched in and operate at the degree orbital location 
capital lease obligations we have two ten year satellite service agreements with ses americom to lease all the capacity on the following satellites amc amc  an fss satellite  commenced commercial operation during january this lease is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial ten year term  and provides us with certain rights to lease capacity on replacement satellites 
for further discussion  please see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
amc amc  an fss satellite  commenced commercial operation during february this lease is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial ten year term  and provides us with certain rights to lease capacity on replacement satellites 
for further discussion  please see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases sfas  we account for the satellite component of these agreements as capital leases 
the commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under capital lease obligations in the table above 
the commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under satellite related obligations in the table above 
the commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under interest on long term debt in the table above 
purchase obligations our purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for digital set top boxes and related components  digital broadcast operations and transitional service agreements 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
satellite insurance we do not carry insurance for any of the in orbit satellites that we own because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure 
the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance which we may not be able to mitigate by using available capacity on other satellites 
there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in orbit satellites were to fail 
in addition  the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could affect our ability to comply with fcc regulatory obligations and our ability to fund the construction or acquisition of replacement satellites for our in orbit fleet in a timely fashion  or at all 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued future capital requirements we expect to fund our future working capital and capital expenditures primarily from cash generated from operations  existing cash and marketable investment securities and future financings 
our ability to generate positive net cash flows from operations is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to retain existing customers and generate new business 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan 
in addition  the current significant volatility of financial markets has greatly affected the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities 
to the extent we require access to funds  we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions  falling short of our capital needs 
our future capital expenditures are likely to increase if we make additional investments in infrastructure necessary to support and expand our satellite services business  or if we decide to purchase one or more additional satellites 
other aspects of our business operations may also require additional capital 
we periodically evaluate various strategic initiatives  the pursuit of which also could require us to raise significant additional capital 
we may also use a significant portion of our existing cash to fund a potential stock buyback program of up to million of our class a common stock  of which million remained available as of december  however  there can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms or at all 
recent development in the financial markets such as the scarcity of capital have made it more difficult for borrowers to access capital markets on acceptable terms or at all  which may significantly constrain our ability to obtain financing to support our business operations 
these developments in the credit markets may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position and may  as a result  cause us to defer or abandon profitable business strategies that we would otherwise pursue if financing were available on acceptable terms 
in addition  we have no experience as a separate entity in raising capital and we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on reasonable terms or at all 
the recent reduction in our stock price combined with the instability in the equity markets has made it difficult for us to raise equity financing without incurring substantial dilution of our existing shareholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or joint venture agreements on unattractive terms 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
accounting for investments in publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fair value of financial instruments 
fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument 
illiquid credit markets have resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments 
as a result  there is no or limited observable market data for these instruments 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including discount rates  liquidity risks  and estimate of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
acquisition of investments in non marketable investment securities 
we calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given  or for non cash acquisitions  based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or dcf model 
the dcf methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
for further discussion  please see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
for further discussion  please see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors 
however  past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections 
inventory allowance 
management estimates the amount of allowance required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience  the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors 
however  past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include  among other things  estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term volatility  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation 
income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow the guidelines set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
in accordance with sfas  we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our results of operations 
uncertainty in tax positions 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax expense  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
new accounting pronouncements revised business combinations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
we expect sfas r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the character and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the type  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date of january  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes reporting requirements for providing sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
seasonality we are affected by seasonality to the extent it impacts our customers 
our customers in the pay tv industry  including dish network  our largest customer  typically experience seasonality 
historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers for the pay tv industry than the second half of the year 
however  we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures 
backlog we do not have any material backlog of our products 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments our investments are exposed to interest rate and equity price risks  discussed below 
interest rate risk cash and marketable securities 
as of december   our restricted and unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of million 
of that amount  a total of million was invested in a cash  b debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  c commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and d instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended december  of 
a hypothetical decrease in the average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
the value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by  among other things  the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets  as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold 
the value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations 
in general  our marketable investment securities portfolio includes debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes 
as of december   we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments  which are concentrated in a small number of companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio 
the fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments 
as of december   we had million of long term debt  of which million represents our capital lease obligations  which are not subject to the requirements of financial accounting standards board statement no 
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments fas 
equity risk other investments 
we are exposed to equity risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our other investments which totaled million as of december  we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational  financial and strategic business purposes 
these securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and the industry in which the companies operate 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these equity instruments would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the portfolio 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
derivative financial instruments in general  we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes  but we may do so in the future
