item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below and elsewhere in this report on form k  and in our other public filings 
the occurrence of one or more of these risks could also materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
risks related to our business and industry a continuing slowdown in the united states economy  an uncertain economic outlook  and escalating energy costs could lead to further reductions in consumer demand for our products in the future 
consumer spending habits  including spending for our products  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salary levels  wage rates  availability of consumer credit  consumer confidence  fluctuating fuel and energy costs  and consumer perception of economic conditions 
consumer discretionary spending  including purchases of women s apparel  tends to decline during recessionary periods 
the continuing general slowdown in the united states economy  the global credit crisis  and an uncertain economic outlook have adversely affected consumer spending habits and customer traffic  which have contributed to a reduction in our net sales 
we cannot reliably predict the extent to which the current economic conditions will affect our business 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends  customer preferences  and other fashion related factors 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and tend to change rapidly  particularly for women s apparel 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to quickly changing fashion tastes and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
these risks may increase as we shift a higher proportion of our product from third party vendors to internally designed merchandise 
if we are unable to successfully implement our plans for the transformation of our brands to a vertical store model or successfully predict or respond to changing styles or trends and misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines  our sales will be lower and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed sales opportunities 
in response  we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
this could also impact our reputation with our customers  which could diminish brand loyalty 
existing and increased competition in the women s retail apparel and direct to consumer markets may reduce our net revenues  profits  and market share 
the women s specialty retail apparel and direct to consumer markets are highly competitive 
our competitors include individual and chain fashion specialty stores  department stores  discount stores  catalog retailers  and internet based retailers 
as a result of this competition we are required to effectively market and competitively price our products to consumers in diverse markets  and we may experience pricing pressures  increased marketing expenditures  and loss of market share 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations  including reduced sales and margins 

table of contents we believe that the principal bases upon which we compete are merchandise style  size  selection  fit  quality  display  price  attractive website layout  efficient fulfillment of website mail orders  and personalized service to our customers  as well as store location  design  advertising  and promotion 
other women s apparel and direct to consumer companies with greater financial resources  marketing capabilities  or brand recognition may enter the plus size business 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
maintaining and improving our operating margins are dependent on our ability to successfully control our operating costs 
in order to maintain or improve our operating margins we need to successfully manage our operating costs 
our inability to successfully manage labor costs  occupancy costs  or other operating costs  or our inability to take advantage of opportunities to reduce operating costs  could adversely affect our operating margins and our results of operations 
we are subject to the fair labor standards act and various state and federal laws and regulations governing such matters as minimum wages  exempt status classification  overtime  and employee benefits 
changes in federal or state laws or regulations regarding minimum wages  unionization  or other employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefit costs  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
the finance charges on most of our proprietary credit card accounts are billed using a floating rate index  subject to a floor and limited by legal maximums 
changes in legislation limiting interest rates and other credit card charges that can be billed on credit card accounts could negatively impact the operating margins of our credit operation 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our operations at a reasonable cost 
we may be unable to attain the expected results of our cost cutting initiatives 
in fiscal we announced initiatives and actions designed to streamline our business operations and further sharpen our focus on our core businesses  including the discontinuation of our lane bryant woman catalog and our figure magazine  and reduction of operating expenses and capital expenditures  improve cash flow  and enhance shareholder value 
the benefits of our initiatives are based on forecasts which could vary substantially from our actual results 
we cannot assure the successful implementation of our planned cost reduction and capital budget reduction plans  and we cannot assure the realization of our anticipated annualized expense savings from cost reduction initiatives and restructuring programs announced in fiscal we may not be able to obtain sufficient working capital financing 
our business requires substantial investment in our inventory for a long period before sales of that inventory occur 
consequently  we require significant amounts of working capital financing 
we depend on the availability of credit to fund our working capital  including credit we receive from our suppliers and their agents  on our credit card securitization program  and on our revolving credit facility 
in addition  the current global financial crisis could adversely affect our ability or the ability of our vendors to secure adequate credit financing 
if we or our vendors are unable to obtain sufficient financing at an affordable cost  our ability to merchandise our retail stores or e commerce businesses could be adversely affected 
we plan to refinance our maturing credit card term securitization series with our credit conduit facilities  which are renewed annually  or through the issuance of a new term series 
to the extent that our conduit facilities are not renewed they would begin to amortize and we would finance this amortization using our committed revolving credit facilities to the extent available 
there is no assurance that we can refinance or renew our conduit facilities on terms comparable to our existing facilities or that there would be sufficient availability under our revolving credit facilities for such financing 
these concerns are heightened by the current global economic credit crisis 
without adequate liquidity  our ability to offer our credit program to our customers  and consequently our financial condition and results of operations  would be adversely affected 

table of contents on february   moody s investors service  a nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro that has rated our term series securitizations in the past  announced that it had downgraded the ratings of our term series asset backed securities 
no other nrsro took a similar action 
the moody s action could negatively impact our ability to complete future term series securitization transactions on acceptable terms and cause our asset securitization program to rely on other potentially more expensive funding sources to the extent available 
the moody s action does not affect our current conduit and term series transactions  which we currently expect will provide sufficient funding for our securitization program for fiscal our operating results fluctuate from season to season 
our retail store and direct to consumer operations experience seasonal fluctuations in net sales and consequently in operating income  with peak sales typically occurring during the easter  labor day  and december holiday seasons 
in addition  extreme or unseasonable weather can affect our sales 
any decrease in net sales or margins during our peak selling periods similar to what we experienced during our december holiday season  or in the availability of working capital needed in the months before these periods  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory  including perishable products for our figi s food and gift catalog  before the peak selling periods 
if we are not successful in selling our inventory  especially during our peak selling periods  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of the inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we face challenges in managing our business 
our operating challenges and management responsibilities are increasing as we re focus on the development of our core brands  divestiture of our non core assets  and the implementation of our plans for the transformation of our brands to a vertical store model 
successful long term growth will require that we continue to expand and improve our internal systems and our operations  including our internal sourcing operations 
our long term growth plan for our retail stores segment depends on our ability to open and operate new retail stores and to convert  where applicable  the formats of existing stores on a profitable basis 
in addition  we will need to identify  hire  and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to work in our stores 
these objectives have created  and may continue to create  additional demands on our staff and on our operating systems 
we cannot assure the successful implementation of our business plan to re focus on our core brands  divest non core assets including the sale of our figi s catalog  and transform our operations to a vertical store model  or that we will achieve our objectives as quickly or as effectively as we have planned 
any delays in achieving our objectives could substantially increase the costs associated with such initiatives 
recent changes in our management as part of an effort to improve our competitive position and operating results may not achieve the desired results 

table of contents we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
our success and our ability to execute our business strategy depend largely on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and their management teams 
we also must motivate employees to remain focused on our strategies and goals  particularly during a period of changing executive leadership at both our corporate level and our operating division level 
the inability to find a suitable permanent replacement for our interim chief executive officer within a reasonable time period could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
our business plan is largely dependent upon continued growth in the plus size women s apparel market 
our business is primarily focused on sales of plus size women s apparel  which represents a majority of our total net sales 
our operating results could be adversely affected by a lack of continued growth in the plus size women s apparel market 
we could be materially and adversely affected if any of our distribution or fulfillment centers are shut down 
we operate distribution and fulfillment centers in greencastle  indiana  white marsh  maryland  marshfield  wisconsin  and stevens point  wisconsin and use a third party fulfillment center in indianapolis  indiana that services our e commerce operations 
in addition  we use third party freight consolidators and service providers in los angeles  california and north bergen  new jersey 
most of the merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution and fulfillment centers or freight consolidators where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores or to the customer 
if any of our distribution centers  fulfillment centers  or freight consolidators were to shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason  the other locations may not be able to adequately support the resulting additional distribution demands  in part because of capacity constraints and in part because each location services a particular brand or brands 
as a result  we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores or customers during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the affected distribution center  fulfillment center  or freight consolidator 
the occurrence of  or threat of  a natural disaster  war  acts of terrorism  or other armed conflict on the united states or international economies may negatively impact the availability of merchandise and otherwise adversely impact our business 
the occurrence of  or threat of  a natural disaster  war  acts of terrorism  or other armed conflict could negatively affect our ability to obtain merchandise for sale in our stores or through our direct to consumer business 
a significant portion of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our net sales and profit margins may be adversely impacted 
if commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers  fulfillment centers  freight consolidators  stores  or our direct to consumer customers 
as a result of the occurrence of  or threat of  a natural disaster or acts of terrorism in the united states we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents our inability to successfully manage customer service or fulfillment for our e commerce websites could adversely impact our operating results 
successful management of our e commerce operations is dependent on our ability to maintain efficient and uninterrupted customer service and order fulfillment 
inadequate systems capacity  a disruption or slowdown in telecommunications services  changes in technology  changes in government regulations  systems issues  security breaches  a failure to integrate order management systems  or customer privacy issues could result in reduced sales or increases in operating expenses as a result of our efforts or our inability to remedy such issues 
in addition  we may not be able to hire sufficient qualified associates to support our e commerce operations during peak periods  especially during the december holiday season 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our e commerce business 
during fiscal we began to implement a new and upgraded e commerce platform through an outsourcing arrangement and the consolidation of our e commerce business at our bensalem  pennsylvania headquarters 
if we are unsuccessful in effectively implementing the new platform and consolidation our e commerce business could be adversely affected 
we rely on foreign sources of production 
we purchase a significant portion of our apparel directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 
we face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad 
such risks include but are not necessarily limited to political instability  increased security requirements applicable to imported goods  trade restrictions  imposition of or changes in duties  quotas  taxes  and other charges on imports  currency and exchange risks  issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards  concerns over anti dumping  delays in shipping  or increased costs of transportation 
new requirements could be proposed that would have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and could include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that  if enacted  could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries 
our purchasing patterns are dictated by our seasonal inventory requirements 
we typically enter into purchase commitments with our vendors for seasonal inventories up to six months ahead of when we take delivery of those products 
all of our purchase commitments with foreign vendors are denominated in us dollars and are settled in us dollars 
these arrangements provide a natural hedge to the impacts of changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies during the period from when we enter into purchase commitments with our vendors to when we take delivery of the products in the countries from which we source our products 
however  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies can impact the negotiated pricing for products when comparing one seasonal buying period to another 
we have a network of countries and vendors from which we can source  but additional weakening of the us dollar in relation to those foreign currencies could negatively impact the cost of our foreign sourced products 
the future performance of our business depends on our foreign suppliers and may be adversely affected by the factors listed above  which are beyond our control 

table of contents issues of global workplace conditions may adversely affect our business 
if any one of our manufacturers or vendors fails to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  is perceived by the public as failing to meet certain labor standards in the united states  or employs unfair labor practices  our business could be adversely affected 
current global workplace concerns of the public include perceived low wages  poor working conditions  age of employees  and various other employment standards 
these globalization issues may affect the available supply of certain manufacturers products  which may result in increased costs to us 
furthermore  a negative customer perception of any of our key vendors or their products may result in a lower customer demand for our apparel 
we depend on strip shopping center and mall traffic and our ability to identify suitable store locations for our retail stores segment 
our sales are dependent in part on a high volume of strip shopping center and mall traffic 
strip shopping center and mall traffic may be adversely affected by  among other things  economic downturns  the closing of anchor stores  or changes in customer shopping preferences 
a decline in the popularity of strip shopping center or mall shopping among our target customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations 
we cannot assure that desirable store locations will continue to be available 
acquisition of additional store locations is also dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate lease terms for such locations 
in addition  the timely opening of new store locations could be adversely affected by delays in obtaining necessary permits and approvals  lack of availability of construction materials and labor  or work stoppages 
our ability to acquire or maintain desirable store locations could be adversely affected by financial difficulties encountered by strip shopping center or mall landlords 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and servicemarks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and servicemarks on a worldwide basis 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and servicemarks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks  servicemarks  or proprietary rights 
also  others may assert rights in  or ownership of  our trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may acquire or divest businesses or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances  which may materially affect our business  financial condition  and operating results 
we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses and may decide to buy or sell businesses or enter into joint ventures or other strategic alliances 
significant acquisitions and alliances may increase demands on management  financial resources  and information and internal control systems 
our success with respect to acquisitions and alliances will depend  in part  on our ability to manage and integrate acquired businesses and alliances with our existing businesses and to successfully implement  improve  and expand our systems  procedures  and controls 
in addition  we may divest existing businesses  which would cause a decline in revenues and may make our financial results more volatile 
if we fail to integrate and manage acquired businesses successfully or to manage the risks associated with divestitures  joint ventures  or other alliances  our business  financial condition  and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents other risks anti takeover provisions in our governing documents and pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us 
some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a change in control  such as provisions that do not permit cumulative voting  permit our board to issue blank check preferred stock without shareholder approval  require certain advance notice procedures with regard to the nomination of candidates for election as directors  other than nominations by or at the direction of our board  prevent our directors from being removed without cause except upon super majority shareholder approval  and prevent a holder of or more of our common stock from taking certain actions without certain approvals 
we also have adopted a shareholder rights plan that expires in april this plan may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us  and may discourage open market purchases of our common stock or a non negotiated tender or exchange offer for such stock and  accordingly  may limit a shareholder s ability to realize a premium over the market price of our common stock in connection with any such transaction 
failure to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are required to include our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports 
our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on whether or not they believe that we maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a possible loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting 
such a failure could result in our inability to provide timely and or reliable financial information and could adversely affect our business 
we could be required to repurchase our senior convertible notes due may  for cash prior to maturity of the notes 
the holders of our senior convertible notes due may  the notes could require us to repurchase the principal amount of the notes for cash before maturity of the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the prospectus filed in connection with the notes 
such a repurchase would require significant amounts of cash  would be subject to important limitations on our ability to repurchase  such as the risk of our inability to obtain funds for such repurchase  and could adversely affect our financial condition 
see if we are unable to maintain the standards necessary for continued listing on the nasdaq global select market our common stock could be de listed 
such de listing could have an adverse effect on the market liquidity of our common stock and could harm our business 
below for additional information 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain the standards necessary for continued listing on the nasdaq global select market our common stock could be de listed 
such de listing could have an adverse effect on the market liquidity of our common stock and could harm our business 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global select market 
nasdaq rules require  among other things  that the minimum closing bid price of our common stock be at least 
recently  our common stock has traded below per share 
if the minimum closing bid price of our common stock fails to meet nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement for a period of consecutive business days  nasdaq may take steps to de list our common stock 
however  before any de listing could occur  we would have an initial day cure period in which to achieve compliance with the minimum closing bid price 
if we were unable to achieve compliance within this day period  we could transfer to the nasdaq capital market if we then meet its initial listing criteria other than the minimum bid price 
following such transfer  we would have an additional day period in which to achieve compliance with the minimum bid price 
on march   nasdaq suspended the per share minimum closing bid price requirement through at least july  consequently  for as long as nasdaq s rule suspension remains in effect  nasdaq will not take steps to de list our common stock if the minimum closing bid price for our common stock trades below per share during the rule suspension period 
we can provide no assurance  however  that nasdaq will extend this rule suspension period beyond july  any de listing would likely have an adverse impact on the liquidity of our common stock and  as a result  the market price for our common stock could become more volatile and significantly decline 
we may seek to avoid de listing by requesting shareholder approval for a reverse stock split 
however  we can give no assurance that such action would stabilize the market price  improve the liquidity of our common stock  or would prevent our common stock from dropping below the nasdaq minimum closing bid price requirement in the future 
such consequences may however be mitigated by our dual listing on the chicago stock exchange 
holders of our notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash prior to maturity upon a fundamental change  which is deemed to have occurred if  among other events  our common stock at any time is not listed for trading on a us national or regional securities exchange 
due to the above risk that we could be subject to de listing from the nasdaq global select market  we applied for dual listing on the chicago stock exchange chx and began trading on march  the chx does not have a minimum stock price requirement for listing 
new accounting rules or regulations or changes in existing rules or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 
changes to existing accounting rules or the adoption of new rules could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued exposure drafts proposing amendments to statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
currently  transfers of our credit card receivables in securitization transactions qualify for sale accounting treatment 
we do not consolidate the trust used in our securitizations for financial reporting purposes because the trust is a qualifying special purpose entity qspe 
because the transfers qualify as sales and the trust is not subject to consolidation under current generally accepted accounting principles  we do not include the assets and liabilities of the trust in our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents under the proposed amendments  the concept of a qspe would be eliminated  the consolidation model for variable interest entities would be modified  and a continual reassessment of consolidation conclusions would be required 
if adopted  we would be required to adopt the amendments as of the beginning of fiscal as a result of adoption  we could be required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of our securitization trust  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in estimates related to our evaluation of property  plant  equipment  goodwill  or intangible assets for impairment could adversely affect our reported results of operations 
we make certain significant assumptions  estimates  and projections related to the useful lives and valuation of our property  plant  and equipment and the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
the carrying amount and or useful life of these assets are subject to periodic and or annual valuation tests for impairment 
impairment results when the carrying value of an asset exceeds the undiscounted or for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the discounted future cash flows associated with the asset 
if actual experience were to differ materially from the assumptions  estimates  and projections used to determine useful lives or the valuation of property  plant  equipment  goodwill  or intangible assets  a write down for impairment of the carrying value of the assets  or acceleration of depreciation or amortization of the assets  could result 
such a write down or acceleration of depreciation or amortization could have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
item b 
unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties we lease all our stores with the exception of three stores that we own 
typically  our store leases have initial terms of to years and generally contain provisions for co tenancies  renewal options  additional rents based on a percentage of sales  and payment of real estate taxes and common area charges 
in addition  we lease certain of our corporate office  distribution center  warehouse  and other administrative facilities 
additional information with respect to our real estate leases is included in
