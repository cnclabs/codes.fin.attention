overview aryx is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a portfolio of internally discovered product candidates designed to eliminate known safety issues associated with well established  commercially successful drugs 
we use our retrometabolic drug design technology to design structurally unique molecules that retain the efficacy of these original drugs but are metabolized through a potentially safer pathway to avoid specific adverse side effects associated with these compounds 
our product candidate portfolio includes an oral anticoagulant  tecarfarin ati  designed to have the same therapeutic benefits as warfarin  currently in phase  clinical development for the treatment of patients who are at risk for the formation of dangerous blood clots  an oral antiarrhythmic agent  budiodarone ati  designed to have the efficacy of amiodarone in phase clinical development for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  a form of irregular heartbeat  an oral prokinetic agent  ati  designed to have the same therapeutic benefits as cisapride in phase clinical development for the treatment of chronic constipation  gastroparesis  functional dyspepsia  irritable bowel syndrome with constipation  and gastroesophageal reflux disease  and a novel  next generation atypical antipsychotic agent  ati  currently in phase clinical development for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders 
additionally  we have multiple product candidates in preclinical development 
each of our product candidates is an orally available  patentable new chemical entity designed to address similar indications as those of the original drug upon which each is based 
our product candidates target what we believe to be multi billion dollar market opportunities 
we operate in a single business segment with regard to the development of human pharmaceutical products 
we were incorporated in the state of california on february  and reincorporated in the state of delaware on august  we maintain a wholly owned subsidiary  aryx therapeutics limited  with registered offices in the united kingdom  which has had no operations since its inception in september and was established to serve only as a legal entity as required in support of our clinical trial activities conducted in europe 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the next several years as we develop our own product candidates  potentially acquire or in license additional products or product candidates  conduct clinical trials  manufacture materials for use in nonclinical studies and clinical trials  expand our research and development activities  seek regulatory approvals and engage in commercialization preparation activities 
it is very expensive to gain approval of and launch a pharmaceutical product 
many expenses are incurred before revenue is 
table of contents received 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable  if at all 
revenue in connection with our prior collaboration agreement with p g  we received a million nonrefundable upfront license fee in august the million payment was recorded in our balance sheet as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as revenue on a straight line basis over the performance and service period 
the collaboration agreement was terminated on july   at which time the performance and service period effectively ended 
pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement  we are under no obligation to return any portion of the upfront license fee to p g 
as a result  we have recognized as revenue all million of the nonrefundable upfront license fee as of december  in addition  we have recognized a cumulative total of million as of december  as collaboration service revenue in connection with product formulation and manufacturing  patent filing and maintenance  and other development services related to the ati program 
effective with p g s notice of termination on july   we no longer provide these support services to p g for the development of ati  therefore those services will no longer be a source of revenue for us 
revenue generated from the p g agreement was our only source of revenue 
while we intend to seek partners for each of the four product candidates in our portfolio  there is no assurance that partnering arrangements will be available to us or on terms acceptable to us 
see part i item a 
risk factors of this report for further discussion 
cost of collaboration service revenue we incurred costs for certain services provided to p g  including costs for pharmaceutical development  patent filing and maintenance and other activities related to the ati program  which are related to the service revenue we generated in connection with our collaboration agreement with p g 
these expenses are reported separately in our income statement as cost of collaboration service revenue 
as of december   we have recorded a cumulative total of million of expense related to these activities since the commencement of our collaboration arrangement with p g in june research and development our research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in identifying  testing and developing our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of fees paid to contract research organizations and other third parties to assist us in managing  monitoring and analyzing our clinical trials  clinical trial costs paid to sites and investigators fees  costs of nonclinical studies including toxicity studies in animals  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and nonclinical studies  laboratory related expenses  research and development support costs including certain regulatory  quality assurance  project management and administration  allocated expenses such as facilities and information technology that are used to support our research and development activities and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expense 
currently  we conduct our clinical trials primarily through coordination with contract research organizations and other third party service providers 
we recognize research and development expense for these activities based upon a variety of factors  including actual and estimated patient enrollment  clinical site initiation activities  direct pass through costs and other activity based factors 

table of contents the following table summarizes our research and development expense for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands direct research and development expense by product candidate tecarfarin budiodarone ati ati other research programs total direct research and development expense personnel  administrative and other expense less research and development portion of the cost of collaboration service revenue total research and development expense from our inception through december   we estimate that approximately million of expense was incurred for our tecarfarin product candidate  approximately million was incurred for our budiodarone product candidate  approximately million was incurred for our ati product candidate  approximately million was incurred for our ati product candidate  and approximately million was incurred for our personnel  administrative and other research and development program expense 
the expenditures summarized in the above table reflect costs directly attributable to each product candidate and to our other research programs 
we do not allocate salaries  employee benefits  or other indirect costs to our product candidates or other research programs and have included those expenses in personnel  administrative and other expense in the above table 
the portion of our research and development expense that is identified as cost of collaboration service revenue is included within a separate category of expense in our condensed consolidated financial statements and is subtracted from total expenses in the above table to derive total research and development expense as reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the various stages of development of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product candidates  our future research and development expense will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments as to each product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates will be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 

table of contents the process of developing and obtaining fda approval of products is costly and time consuming 
development activities and clinical trials can take years to complete  and failure can occur at any time during the development and clinical trial process 
in addition  the results from early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in subsequent and larger clinical trials  and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed successfully through initial clinical testing 
although our approach to identifying and developing new product candidates is designed to mitigate risk  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
further  even if our product candidates are approved for sale  they may not be successfully commercialized and therefore the future revenue we anticipate may not materialize 
if we fail to complete the development of any of our product candidates in a timely manner  it could have a material effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us or our partners to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed in part i item a 
risk factors section of this report 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance and accounting  human resources  business development  commercial operations  and other internal support functions 
in addition  administrative expenses include insurance and professional fees for legal  consulting  tax  accounting and other services 
interest and other income  net interest and other income consist of interest income from our investments in marketable securities and benefits related to the reassessment of the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability in and  net of other expenses including losses on marketable securities  state franchise and other business taxes 
interest expense interest expense consists primarily of cash and non cash interest costs related to our outstanding debt 
included in interest expense is the cost of warrants to purchase our common stock issued in connection with debt financing arrangements 
income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which expire between and if not utilized  and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million which expire beginning in if not utilized 
in addition  we have net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million which expire between and if not utilized  and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million which do not expire 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  provides for a limitation on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the event that there is a change in ownership as defined in this section 
we concluded that we experienced such a change in ownership in june of as a result of this change in ownership  our ability to use the net operating losses and tax credits incurred prior to the ownership change will likely be limited in future periods 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  we have had to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty  and are made based upon our historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained  and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments and assumptions that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we also refer you to our organization and summary of significant accounting policies discussed in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
fair value estimates of auction rate securities in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands fair value measurement disclosure 
the measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities became effective for us beginning in the first quarter of accordingly  we began to measure the fair value of financial assets in our available for sale securities portfolio beginning in the first quarter of and began to value our auction rate securities using significant unobservable inputs 
in early  market auctions for certain of the auction rate securities held in our portfolio began to fail causing those securities to become temporarily illiquid 
although we did experience liquidity in our auction rate securities portfolio during the first nine months of  the illiquid auction rate market at large requires that our remaining auction rate holding be measured using significant unobservable inputs in accordance with guidance provided by sfas the fair value of our remaining auction rate security as of december   was determined using a discounted cash flow model that considers inputs such as expected cash flows from the auction rate instrument including expected interest payments  market yields for similarly rated instruments  our estimates of time to liquidity for the security  and a marketability discount 
we revise our estimates for each input as of each financial statement reporting period based upon known and expected market conditions as well as specific information we have regarding the instrument 
different inputs to our valuation model that we could have used  or different subjective judgments or assumptions that we could have chosen  are not likely to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
as of december   we held in our marketable securities portfolio one auction rate security with a par value of  we have determined that the fair value of the instrument was  net of an estimated  loss representing a reduction in the carrying value for this instrument 
based on the lack of liquidity in the auction rate market and our expectations regarding near term market conditions  we concluded that the impairment to the fair value of our auction rate holding as of december   is other than temporary in accordance with guidance provided by fsp fas the reduction in carrying value is reflected as a loss in our consolidated statement of operations as we expect that it is more likely than not that the instrument will remain illiquid in the 
table of contents next months 
accordingly  we classify this auction rate instrument as an other non current asset on the balance sheet as of december  revenue recognition we follow the revenue recognition criteria outlined in the sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue arrangements with multiple components are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered component has stand alone value to the customer  and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria  such as persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  transfer of technology has been completed or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured  are then applied to each of the units 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  what the period of involvement is  whether transfer of technology has been completed or services have been rendered during the period of involvement  and the ultimate collectibility of payments is based on management s judgments 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
for each source of revenue  we comply with the above revenue recognition criteria in the following manner nonrefundable upfront license fees received with separable stand alone values are recognized when intangible property rights are transferred  provided that the transfer of rights is not dependent upon continued efforts by us with respect to the agreement 
if the transferred rights do not have stand alone value  or if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements does not exist  the amount of revenue allocable to the transferred rights and the undelivered elements is deferred and amortized over the related performance and service period in which the remaining undelivered elements are provided to our partner 
with respect to our prior collaboration agreement with p g  the million nonrefundable upfront license fee was deferred upon receipt  as objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements under the agreement could not be established 
the collaboration agreement was terminated on july   at which time the performance and service period effectively ended 
pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement  we are under no obligation to return any portion of the upfront license fee to p g 
accordingly  we recognized the remaining million of deferred revenue in the third quarter of when the collaboration was terminated 
service revenue consists of reimbursement of services performed or costs incurred under contractual arrangements 
revenue from such services is based upon negotiated rates for full time equivalent employees that are intended to approximate our anticipated costs  or direct costs incurred 
certain of our costs incurred under the collaboration agreement with p g were reimbursable  and such reimbursement of costs was recognized as revenue on a gross basis as costs were incurred in accordance with the provisions of eitf  reporting revenue gross versus net as an agent 
we have recognized a cumulative total of million as of december  as collaboration service revenue in connection with product formulation and manufacturing  patent filing and maintenance  and other development services related to the ati program since the beginning of our collaboration with p g 
effective with p g s notice of termination of the collaboration agreement in july  we no longer provide these support services to p g for the development of ati and therefore those services will no longer be a source of revenue for us 

table of contents payments associated with milestones  which are contingent upon future events for which there is reasonable uncertainty as to their achievement at the time the agreement was entered into  are recognized as revenue when these milestones  as defined in the contract  are achieved and provided that no further performance obligations are required of us 
milestone payments are typically triggered either by the progress or results of clinical trials or by external events  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels  all of which are substantially at risk at the inception of the respective collaboration agreement 
in applying this policy  we ascertain certain factors that include whether or not each milestone is individually substantive  the degree of risk associated with the likelihood of achieving each milestone  whether or not the payment associated with each milestone is reasonably proportional to the substantive nature of the milestone  the level of effort  if any  that is anticipated or actually involved in achieving each milestone and the anticipated timing of the achievement of each milestone in relation to other milestones or revenue elements 
amounts received in advance  if any  are recorded as deferred revenue until the associated milestone is reached 
a million milestone payment earned for the delivery to p g of the final trial data related to one of our phase clinical trials for our ati product candidate was recognized as revenue in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  expenses accrued under contractual arrangements with third parties a substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities are performed under contractual arrangements we enter into with external service providers  including contract research organizations and contract manufacturers 
we accrue for costs incurred under these arrangements based on our estimates of services performed and costs incurred as of a particular balance sheet date 
our estimation of expenses incurred is based on facts and circumstances known to us and includes the consideration of factors such as the level of services performed  patient enrollment  administrative costs incurred  and other indicators of services completed 
the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears  and to the extent that amounts invoiced are less than our estimates of expenses incurred  we accrue for those additional costs 
further  based on amounts invoiced to us by our service providers  we may also record certain payments made to those providers as prepaid expenses that will be recognized as expense in future periods as services are rendered 
we make these estimates as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred  our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting expenses that are too high or too low 
any such differences may result in adjustments in future periods 
stock based compensation on january   or the effective date  we began accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  compensation expense related to stock based transactions  including employee and director stock based awards  is estimated at the date of grant based on the stock award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of our share based award to employees and directors using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
due to the fact that we are a newly public company  there is limited historical information available to support our estimate of expected volatility required to value our stock based awards 
prior to september   we used an 
table of contents average volatility estimate based on a group of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry that are similar in size  stage of life cycle and financial leverage 
beginning with the three months ended december   we began using a blended volatility estimate consisting of our own stock and the average volatility of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry 
the expected term represents the period of time that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
as we have a history of stock option exercise experience for use in the calculation  expected terms are based on historical option exercise experience and employee turnover data 
groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are stratified and considered separately in the calculation 
other assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation model include the risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate for periods pertaining to each vesting tranche over the expected term of each option is based on the us treasury strip yield of a similar duration in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid  and do not expect to pay  dividends in the foreseeable future 
the fair value of our stock based awards was estimated at the date of grant using the following assumptions year ended december  expected volatility weighted average expected term in years weighted average risk free interest rate expected dividends weighted average grant date fair value per share sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on our historical experience and separate groups of employees that have similar historical forfeiture behavior are separately considered for expense recognition 
in the absence of a public trading market for our common stock  the fair value of our common stock for the year ended december  was determined by our board of directors in good faith based upon consideration of a number of objective and subjective factors 
in february  we performed an in depth contemporaneous valuation analysis to determine the fair value of our common stock 
the approach we used was consistent with the methods outlined in the aicpa practice aid valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
based on our assessment  we concluded that the fair value of our common stock was per share as of february in july  we performed a contemporaneous valuation analysis which resulted in an estimated fair market value per share at that date of  reflecting an increase in fair value due primarily to our signing of the collaboration agreement with p g 
in october  our board of directors reaffirmed the fair value of our common stock at per share 
we performed a subsequent contemporaneous valuation analysis to determine the fair market value of our common stock as of july  which resulted in an estimated fair market value per share at that date of 
all equity awards to our employees  including executive officers  and to our directors were granted at no less than the fair market value of our common stock as determined in good faith by our board of directors on the date of grant 
we continue to account for stock options issued to non employees in accordance with the recognition provisions of sfas and eitf issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to re measurement over the vesting terms as earned 
the fair value of non employee options in the years ended december   and were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions a dividend yield of zero  volatility of  maximum contractual life of ten years and a risk free interest rate of   and  respectively 
compensation expense related to non employee option grants of   and  was recorded for the years 
table of contents ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   options to purchase shares of our common stock remain subject to re measurement accounting under eitf issue total compensation cost that has been recorded in the statement of operations  which includes stock based compensation expense under sfas r and the value of options issued to non employees for services rendered  is allocated as follows year ended december  in thousands research and development officer compensation employee and consultant compensation selling  general and administrative director and officer compensation employee and consultant compensation total stock based compensation the total compensation cost related to unvested stock option grants not yet recognized as of december  was million  and the weighted average period over which these grants are expected to vest is years

under the terms of the securities purchase agreement  the price for each share of common stock purchased was 
the total number of shares of common stock underlying each purchaser s warrant was equal to of the total number of shares purchased by such investor in the private placement with a purchase price per underlying share of common stock of

as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand as of december  will be sufficient to fund our operations through the end of the first quarter of however  since our inception  we have incurred significant net operating losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved sustainable profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant net losses for the next several years 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will achieve positive cash flow in the foreseeable future or at all 
due to adverse developments in global financial markets  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to certain of our investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities 
these investments are generally held to maturity  which is less than one year with the exception of our remaining holding in an auction rate instrument 
if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience realized losses upon liquidation 
however  due to the short duration of all but one of the 
table of contents securities in our portfolio  we believe that we have the ability to hold all but one of those securities to maturity when they will be redeemed at par value

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached a consensus for exposure on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  which was subsequently ratified by the fasb and is currently subject to a day public comment period 
the eitf discussed a model that would amend eitf to require an entity to estimate the selling price of the undelivered element of accounting and allocate the arrangement consideration using the residual method when the entity does not have vendor specific objective evidence or acceptable third party evidence of the selling price for the undelivered element of accounting 
if confirmed  eitf will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or modified in the fiscal years beginning after december  as we do not currently have any revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables  we will evaluate the impact of eitf for revenue arrangement that we may enter into in the future 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  or eitf eitf provides guidance on how to determine if certain instruments or embedded features are considered indexed to a company s own stock  including instruments similar to warrants to purchase the company s stock 
eitf requires companies to use a two step approach to evaluate an instrument s contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions in determining whether the instrument is considered to be indexed to its own stock and therefore exempt from the application of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
although eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   any outstanding instrument at the date of adoption will require a retrospective application of the accounting through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on either our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  or sfas sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap 
sfas is effective days following the securities exchange commission s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles

in december  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
eitf also establishes the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for joint operating activities and payments between participants  as well as the sufficiency of the disclosures related to these arrangements 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of eitf on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk our exposure to interest rate risk is related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the goal of our investment policy is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from such investments without assuming material risks 
to achieve our goal  we maintain a marketable securities portfolio of investments in various debt instruments 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million individually having maturities or interest rate reset periods of less than one year 
a decline in short term interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term investments 
a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately  due to the composition and expected duration of our short term investment portfolio  we do not expect a basis point change in short term interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of our short term investments 
since our inception  unrealized and realized losses in our marketable securities portfolio arising from interest rate fluctuations have not been material 
we actively monitor changes in the interest rate environment to assess its potential impact on our investment portfolio 
as of december   a single auction rate security with an estimated fair value of  remained in our marketable securities portfolio 
as of december   the security had limited market liquidity 
while we believe that the limited liquidity for this instrument is due to temporary market conditions  we have revalued our estimate of fair value for this instrument in light of current market conditions 
based on our revaluation  we recorded a  loss in our consolidated statement of operations as of december   representing a discount to par value for the instrument 
as of december   our marketable securities portfolio included million of auction rate securities 
subsequent to at least one successful auction with respect to each of these securities following december   we experienced failed auctions for million of the auction rate securities held in our portfolio 
all of the auction rate securities were  as of december   rated aaa by a reputable rating agency 
foreign currency risk in conducting our business  we occasionally enter into contractual arrangements with third party research and development service providers having operations in locations outside of the united states 
to the extent that payments for those services are contractually required to be made in currencies other than the us dollar  we may be subject to exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
to date  the effect of our exposure to these fluctuations in foreign exchange rates has not been material  and we do not expect it to become material in the foreseeable future 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposures and have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes
