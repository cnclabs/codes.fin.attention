our discussion is organized as follows company overview and business strategy this section provides a general description of our company and business plans 
critical accounting policies this section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require the exercise of judgment and use of estimates on the part of management in their application 
in addition  all of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies and estimates  are discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  including comparisons of the results for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources this section provides a discussion on our capital resources  future capital requirements  cash flows  committed equity financing facilities  historical financing transactions  outstanding debt arrangements and commitments 
overview discovery laboratories  inc referred to as we  us  or the company is a biotechnology company developing surfactant replacement therapies srt to treat respiratory disorders and diseases for which there frequently are few or no approved therapies 
our novel proprietary technology kl surfactant technology produces a synthetic  peptide containing surfactant kl surfactant that is structurally similar to pulmonary surfactant  a substance produced naturally in the lung and essential for survival and normal respiratory function 
in addition  our proprietary capillary aerosol generating technology capillary aerosolization technology produces a dense aerosol with a defined particle size  to potentially deliver our aerosolized kl surfactant to the deep lung 
as many respiratory disorders are associated with surfactant deficiency or surfactant degradation  we believe that our proprietary technology platform makes it possible  for the first time  to develop a significant pipeline of surfactant products targeted to treat a wide range of previously unaddressed respiratory problems 
we are currently focused on developing our lead products  surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf  to address the most significant respiratory conditions affecting pediatric populations 
surfaxin  our first product based on our novel kl surfactant technology  if approved  will represent the first synthetic  peptide containing surfactant for use in pediatric medicine 
we have filed with the us food and drug administration fda a new drug application nda for surfaxin lucinactant for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome rds in premature infants 
the fda has established april  as its target action date to complete its review of this nda and potentially grant marketing approval 
aerosurf is our proprietary kl surfactant in aerosolized form  which we are developing using our capillary aerosolization technology initially to treat premature infants at risk for rds 
premature infants with rds are treated with surfactants that are administered by means of invasive endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation  procedures that frequently result in serious respiratory conditions and complications 
with aerosurf  if approved  it will be possible to administer surfactant into the deep lung without subjecting patients to such invasive procedures 
we believe that aerosurf has the potential to enable a potentially significant increase in the use of srt in pediatric medicine 
we plan over time to develop our kl surfactant technology into a robust pipeline of products that will potentially address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions in a range of patient populations  from premature infants to adults  that suffer from severe and debilitating respiratory conditions for which there currently are few or no approved therapies 
our programs include development of surfaxin to potentially address bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd in premature infants and acute respiratory failure arf in children  and conducting research and development with our kl surfactant to potentially address cystic fibrosis cf  acute lung injury ali  and other diseases associated with inflammation of the lung  such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 
business strategy we received an approvable letter from the fda with respect to surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants in may during the preparation of our complete response to the approvable letter and the fda s ongoing review period  our business strategy has been to conserve our financial resources and rigorously manage limited investments in research and development activities 
the fda has assigned april  as its action target date to complete its review of our nda and potentially approve surfaxin 
following the potential approval of surfaxin by the fda we plan over the near and long term to expand and accelerate our proprietary kl surfactant technology initiatives with pipeline programs intended to apply our synthetic  peptide containing surfactant to a broad range of respiratory conditions 
it is our goal  within existing financial and other constraints  to develop our pipeline as broadly and as quickly as reasonably possible  initially  we plan to focus our development and commercial efforts on the management of rds in premature infants 
we believe that the rds market represents a significant opportunity from both a medical and a business perspective 
o currently  the only available therapies for the treatment of rds  which were approved in the early s  are surfactants derived from bovine cow lung and porcine pig lung sources 
the current annual market for these surfactants is estimated to be approximately million in the united states and million worldwide 
currently  surfactants are administered using endotracheal intubation the invasive insertion of a breathing tube down the trachea and conventional mechanical ventilation  which risk further serious lung injury and complications 
as the medical community is focused on managing rds patients without employing such invasive techniques  only a subset of premature infants at risk for rds annually are treated with these surfactants 
o surfaxin  the first synthetic  peptide containing surfactant that  if approved  will represent an alternative therapy to the currently approved  animal derived surfactants 
we also are developing a lyophilized formulation  surfaxin ls  which  among other things  may potentially simplify storage and distribution requirements and methods of administering surfactant 
we have a development program that is focused on gaining regulatory approval for surfaxin ls in the united states  europe and throughout the world 
we believe that  over time  surfaxin and surfaxin ls  if approved  have the potential to displace the use of the animal derived surfactants 
o aerosurf will potentially provide the neonatal medical community with the possibility of treating premature infants at risk for rds without the risks associated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation 
we plan on making significant investments in the development  regulatory  clinical and manufacturing activities necessary to gain regulatory approval for aerosurf in the united states and worldwide 
we believe that aerosurf  if approved  will allow for a potentially significant increase in the number of infants receiving surfactant therapy  who currently are not treated because the benefits of surfactant therapy are believed to be outweighed by the risks of invasive administration 
we believe that the combination of surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf  if approved  have the potential  for the first time in years  to advance the treatment of rds and make it possible for many more infants at risk for rds to be treated with srt 
our kl surfactant technology also has the potential to address a range of other serious and debilitating neonatal and pediatric indications  many of which represent significant unmet medical needs  potentially redefining pediatric respiratory medicine 
with our surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf programs  we plan to build a fully integrated pediatric franchise 
o in the united states  we plan to establish our own specialty pulmonary commercial organization that will initially execute the launch of surfaxin and specialize in neonatal and pediatric indications 
to execute this strategy  we expect to incur expenses at an annual rate of approximately million for sales  marketing and medical affairs capabilities 
we believe that this strategy will provide us direct control over our us sales and marketing activities  permit us to establish a strong presence in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units nationwide  and potentially optimize the economics of our business 
if  however  we were presented with an alternative approach  through a strategic alliance or other collaboration arrangement  that would achieve the foregoing  and provide appropriate financial consideration and operational capabilities  we would consider such a potential transaction 
o for international markets  we plan to seek strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements to support development and potential commercialization of surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf to address a wide range of neonatal and pediatric indications  we also plan to invest opportunistically in kl surfactant technology pipeline programs that will target adult and other indications we believe represent potentially significant market opportunities 
we plan to initially develop these programs through a proof of concept phase and  if successful  thereafter seek worldwide strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements for development and or commercialization 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in demonstrating proof of concept or entering into any such alliance  but if we are successful  we believe that these programs could address significant unmet medical needs and potentially redefine respiratory medicine  we have  and will continue  to invest in maintaining and perfecting our potential competitive position by protecting our exclusive rights in and to our kl surfactant technology  pipeline products and capillary aerosolization technology through patents  patent extensions  trademarks  trade secrets and regulatory exclusivity designations  including potential orphan drug and new drug product exclusivities such as new chemical entity designations and supplemental exclusivities 
we believe that our development programs may also provide opportunities for new patent filings  which may potentially significantly extend the benefits of exclusivity into the future  we will continue to invest in our quality systems and manufacturing capabilities  including at our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey and our analytical laboratories in warrington  pennsylvania 
we plan to manufacture sufficient drug product to meet our anticipated pre clinical  clinical  formulation development and  if approved  potential future commercial requirements of surfaxin  aerosurf and other kl surfactant product candidates 
during the period of formulation development for our lyophilized kl surfactant  including surfaxin ls  we expect to enter into arrangements with one or more contract manufacturing organizations 
for our capillary aerosolization systems  we plan to collaborate with engineering device experts and use contract manufacturers to produce aerosol devices and related components to meet our manufacturing requirements 
our long term manufacturing plans include potentially expanding our existing facilities or building or acquiring additional manufacturing facilities and capabilities to support the production and development of our proprietary kl surfactant technology pipeline products  and we will need significant additional capital to execute our business strategy 
we plan to seek infusions of capital from a variety of potential sources  including strategic alliances  equity financings  debt financings and other similar opportunities  although there can be no assurance that we will identify or enter into any specific alliances or transactions 
our estimates of market size and business opportunities included in this overview section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based in part on our analysis of data derived from the following sources  among others ims midas data mat  september  vermont oxford network data   annual summary of vital statistics  pediatrics  martin et 
al  cdc national vital statistics   management and outcomes of very low birth weight  nejm   eichenwald  stark  the cystic fibrosis foundation  discovery labs primary market research   as well as our analysis of the select and star trials 
in addition  our analysis and assumptions take into account estimated patient populations  expected adoption rates of our products  current pricing  economics and anticipated potential pharmaco economic benefits of our drug products  if approved 
as of december   we had cash and marketable securities of million and three committed equity financing facilities ceffs under which we may  at our discretion subject to certain conditions  including minimum purchase price and volume limitations  to raise in the aggregate up to million capital to support our business plans  although the ceff  which currently has available up to approximately million  will expire in may see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the success of our product development and  if our products are approved  commercialization plans 
however  there is no assurance that our research and development projects will be successful  that products developed including surfaxin for the prevention of rds will obtain regulatory approval in the united states  that any approved product  including surfaxin  will be commercially viable  that any ceff will be available for future financings  or that we will be able to obtain additional capital when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
even if we succeed in raising additional capital and developing and subsequently commercializing product candidates  we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
for further discussion of our accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition research and development strategic alliances and collaboration agreements revenue under strategic alliances and our collaboration agreements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
funds received from these agreements are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized over the performance period as specified in the agreements when all performance obligations are satisfied 
grant revenue is recorded upon receipt of funds 
research and development expenses research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with our personnel  facilities  manufacturing operations  formulation development  research  clinical  regulatory  other preclinical and clinical activities and medical affairs 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
results of operations the net loss for the years ended december   and was million or per share  million or per share  million or per share  respectively 
included in the net loss for the years ended december   and were stock based compensation expenses of million or per share  million or per share  and million or per share  respectively 
additionally  for the year ended december   the net loss included a restructuring charge of million or per share 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring charge 
revenue in march  we restructured our strategic alliance with philip morris usa inc pmusa  d b a chrysalis technologies chrysalis and assumed full responsibility for the development of the capillary aerosolization technology 
as part of the restructuring  chrysalis completed a technology transfer of the capillary aerosolization technology and paid us million to support our further development activities 
we currently hold exclusive licenses to the capillary aerosolization technology both in and outside of the united states for use with pulmonary surfactants alone or in combination with any other pharmaceutical compound s for all respiratory diseases and conditions 
in addition  under the us license agreement  our license to use the capillary aerosolization technology includes other non surfactant drugs to treat a wide range of pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions 
we are obligated to pay royalties at a rate equal to a low single digit percent of sales of products sold 
we also agreed in the future to pay minimum royalties  but are entitled to a reduction of future royalties in an amount equal to the excess of any minimum royalty paid over royalties actually earned in prior periods 
see business business operations strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements 
we did not earn revenue during the years ended december  and we expect the fda to complete its review of our nda in april if surfaxin is approved  we expect our first revenues from product sales in late as surfaxin is a hospital based indication  before we can make any sales at a particular hospital  we will need to comply with that hospital s formulary acceptance requirements  which can be a time consuming process 
as a result  we expect our product revenues to build slowly beginning in and and become more meaningful in and beyond 
we plan to focus our resources on developing a strong pediatric franchise in the united states 
to develop a pediatric franchise in international markets  we plan to seek strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements to support development and potential commercialization of surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf to address a wide range of neonatal and pediatric indications 
in addition  we plan to invest opportunistically in kl surfactant technology pipeline programs that will target adult and other indications that we believe represent potentially significant market opportunities  including potentially cf and ali 
initially  we plan to take these programs through a proof of concept phase  and  if successful  to seek potential worldwide strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements for development and or commercialization of these pipeline programs 
although there can be no assurance that we will succeed in entering into any such arrangements  they would potentially include revenues from up front and milestone payments  as well as financial support for research and development activities

development operations development operations includes medical  scientific  clinical  regulatory  data management and biostatistics activities for the execution of our product development programs 
development operations also includes medical affairs activities  including medical science liaisons  to provide scientific and medical education support in connection with our kl surfactant technology pipeline programs  including the potential approval of surfaxin in the united states 
these costs include personnel  specialized consultants  outside services to support regulatory and data management activities  symposiums at key neonatal medical meetings  facilities related costs  and other costs for the management of clinical trials 
the increase in development operations expenses in as compared to is primarily due to investment in our medical affairs capabilities in anticipation of the potential approval of surfaxin in the united states 
the decrease in development operations expenses in as compared to is primarily due to staff reductions that were implemented following receipt of the april approvable letter and the occurrence of surfaxin process validation batch stability failures in april see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring charge

the decrease in expenses in as compared to is primarily due to our efforts to conserve financial resources by limiting our investment in research and development programs while we focus on potentially gaining regulatory approval for surfaxin in the united states 
direct pre clinical and clinical programs expenses in were primarily associated with i regulatory activities related to our efforts to gain regulatory approval for surfaxin in the united states  ii clinical activities related to a phase clinical trial for the prevention and treatment of bpd in infants completed in october  iii clinical activities related to a phase clinical trial for the treatment of ards in adults completed in march  and iv pre clinical activities for our aerosurf program 
the increase in expenses in as compared to is primarily due to expenses in associated with pre clinical activities for the development of aerosurf and the ongoing phase clinical trial evaluating the use of surfaxin in children up to two years of age suffering with arf 
we will continue to conserve financial resources by limiting our investment in research and development programs while we focus on potentially gaining regulatory approval for surfaxin in the united states 
following the potential approval of surfaxin  if resources permit  we plan to accelerate investment in our kl surfactant pipeline programs and expect our research and development expenses to increase in  primarily associated with development and clinical activities for our lyophilized kl surfactant and our aerosurf program 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of executive management  business and commercial development  finance and accounting  intellectual property and legal  human resources  information technology  facility and other administrative costs

a significant component of general and administrative expenses is pre launch commercial activities associated with preparing for the potential approval and commercial launch of surfaxin  including hiring of certain experienced management personnel to develop and implement our commercialization strategy  investments to support our presence at key neonatal medical meetings  market research activities  and other preparatory sales and marketing activities 
expenses for pre launch commercial activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expenses in were incurred in anticipation of the potential approval and commercial launch of surfaxin in may following receipt of the may approvable letter  we scaled back our pre launch commercial activities while we focused on preparation of the complete response to the may approvable letter and potentially gaining approval of surfaxin 
the expenses in were incurred in anticipation of the potential approval and commercial launch of surfaxin in april following receipt of the april approvable letter and the april surfaxin process validation batch stability failures  we restructured the company  reduced our commercial workforce and terminated certain pre launch commercial programs 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring charge 
following the potential approval of surfaxin  we plan to establish our own specialty pulmonary commercial organization in the united states that will initially execute the launch of surfaxin and  with the introduction of surfaxin ls and aerosurf  if approved  focus on developing a significant pediatric franchise 
we believe that this strategy will provide us direct control over our us sales and marketing activities  permit us to establish a strong presence in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units nationwide  and potentially optimize the economics of our business 
our pre approval preparations have included the hiring of certain experienced management personnel 
we plan to hire our sales representatives only after we have received approval to market surfaxin 
if  however  we were presented with an alternative approach  through a strategic alliance or other collaboration arrangement  that would achieve the foregoing  and provide appropriate financial consideration and operational capabilities  we would consider such a potential transaction 
we believe our existing general and administrative resources  including legal  finance  business development  information technologies  human resources and general management capabilities  are sufficient to support the potential launch of surfaxin in the united states 
we anticipate making additional investments in the future to enhance these capabilities as and when required to meet the needs of our research and development programs and commercial organization 
we also plan additional investments to sustain and perfect our potential competitive position by maintaining our existing patent portfolio  trademarks  trade secrets and regulatory exclusivity designations  including potential orphan drug and new drug product exclusivities  and by investing in new patents  patent extensions  new trademarks  and regulatory exclusivity designations  when available 
see business licensing  patents and other proprietary rights and regulatory designations 
restructuring charge in april  after ongoing analysis of surfaxin process validation batches that had been manufactured as a requirement for our nda indicated that certain stability parameters no longer met acceptance criteria  we reduced staff levels and reorganized management to lower our cost structure and re align our operations with changed business priorities 
the reduction in workforce totaled employees  including three senior executives  and represented approximately of our workforce  primarily from our commercial group 
all affected employees were eligible for severance payments and continuation of benefits 
we incurred a restructuring charge of million in the second quarter associated with the staff reductions and discontinued commercial programs  which was accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
and is identified separately on the statement of operations as restructuring charge 
this charge included million of severance and benefits related to staff reductions and million associated with discontinued commercial programs 
as of december   payments totaling million had been made related to these items and million were unpaid and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
other income expense other income expenses  net was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  as summarized in the chart below dollars in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense other income expense other income expense  net interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and marketable securities 
the decrease in interest income in is due to a general decline in market interest rates and in our average cash and marketable securities balance 
the increase in interest income in is due to an increase in our average cash and marketable securities balance 
interest expense consists of interest accrued on the outstanding balance of our loan with pharmabio development inc pharmabio  the strategic investment group of quintiles transnational corp  and under our equipment financing facilities 
in addition  interest expense includes million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs for warrants issued to pharmabio in october as consideration for a restructuring of our loan in the decrease in interest expense in is due to a decline in the variable interest rate on our pharmabio loan  which is equal to the us prime rate 
the increase in interest expense in is due to a full year of amortization of deferred financing costs for warrants issued in october in connection with the restructuring of our loan with pharmabio 
other income expenses primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of our commonwealth of pennsylvania research and development tax credits million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in proceeds from the sale of these tax credits is due to more credits being available for sale in as compared to and liquidity and capital resources we have incurred substantial losses since inception  due to investments in research and development  manufacturing and potential commercialization activities and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses over the next several years 
historically  we have funded our business operations through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  draw downs under our ceffs  capital equipment and debt facilities  and strategic alliances 
we expect to continue to fund our business operations through a combination of these sources  as well as sales revenue from our product candidates  beginning with surfaxin for rds  if approved 
our capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the success of our product development and commercialization plans 
we are currently focused on developing our lead kl surfactant products  surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf  to address the most significant respiratory conditions affecting pediatric populations 
the fda has established april  as its target action date to complete its review of our surfaxin nda 
see business surfactant replacement therapy srt for respiratory medicine 
as of december   we had million in cash and marketable securities and three ceffs  under which we may potentially raise subject to certain conditions  including stock price and volume limitations up to an aggregate of million  although the ceff  which currently has available up to approximately million  will expire in may see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources committed equity financing facilities 
however  there can be no assurance that our research and development projects will be successful  that products developed including surfaxin will obtain necessary regulatory approval  that any approved product will be commercially viable  that any of the three ceffs will be available for future financings  or that we will be able to obtain additional capital when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
even if we succeed in raising additional capital and developing and subsequently commercializing product candidates  we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital  to fund our research and development and commercial programs and meet our obligations on a timely basis 
if we are unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital  through future debt and equity financings and or strategic and collaborative ventures with potential partners  we will likely not have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to fund our business operations  which could significantly limit our ability to continue as a going concern 
in that event  we may be forced to further limit many  if not all  of our programs and consider other means of creating value for our stockholders  such as licensing the development and commercialization of products that we consider valuable and would otherwise likely develop ourselves 
if we are unable to raise the necessary capital  we may be forced to curtail all of our activities and  ultimately  potentially cease operations 
even if we are able to raise additional capital  such financings may only be available on unattractive terms  or could result in significant dilution of stockholders interests and  in such event  the market price of our common stock may decline 
the balance sheets do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue in existence 
to meet our capital requirements  we continue to consider multiple strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to potential additional financings as well as potential business alliances  commercial and development partnerships and other similar opportunities  although there can be no assurance that we will take any further specific actions or enter into any transactions 
see risk factors in light of the delayed timeline for the anticipated approval for surfaxin  we will have to raise significant additional capital to continue our existing planned research and development activities 
moreover  such additional financing could result in equity dilution  the terms of our indebtedness may impair our ability to conduct our business  our committed equity financing facilities may have a dilutive impact on our stockholders  and future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock  including pursuant to our stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our common stock  could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders  cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 
cash flows we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the decrease of million in is primarily due to million used in operating activities  capital expenditures and principal payments on equipment loans  partially offset by proceeds of million from financings under our ceffs and million from our equipment financing facilities 
the increase of million in is primarily due to million used in operating activities and capital expenditures and principal payments on equipment loans  partially offset by i million of net proceeds from two registered direct offerings of our common stock  ii million of proceeds from financings under our ceffs  and iii million from our equipment financing facilities 
cash flows used in operating activities cash flows used in operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash flows used in operating activities are a result of our net operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses associated with stock based compensation  depreciation and changes in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
for a discussion on our net operating losses  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
cash flows from operating activities in also include million received from chrysalis to support development of our capillary aerosolization technology 
cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in investing activities include capital expenditures of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures were primarily for laboratory and manufacturing equipment to support analytical  quality  manufacturing and development activities 
in  we completed construction of a new analytical and development laboratory in our headquarters in warrington  pennsylvania  for a total cost of approximately million and consolidated at this location the analytical  quality and development activities previously located in doylestown  pennsylvania and mountain view  california 
the laboratory has expanded our capabilities by providing additional capacity to conduct analytical testing as well as opportunities to leverage our consolidated professional expertise across a broad range of projects  improving both operational efficiency and financial economics 
the leases for our doylestown  pennsylvania and mountain view  california locations either expired or were terminated 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations in  capital expenditures primarily consisted of laboratory equipment for our analytical activities 
cash flows from used in investing activities also include cash used to purchase short term marketable securities and cash received from the sale and or maturity of short term marketable securities 
when assessing our cash position and managing our liquidity and capital resources  we do not consider cash flows between cash and marketable securities to be meaningful 
cash used to purchase marketable securities is subject to an investment policy that is approved by the board of directors and that provides for the purchase of high quality marketable securities  while ensuring preservation of capital and fulfillment of liquidity needs 
as of december   available for sale marketable securities consist of united states treasury notes  certificates of deposits  and high quality commercial paper with a maturity of greater than three months 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  as summarized in the chart below in millions year ended december  financings under ceffs financings pursuant to common stock offerings proceeds from equipment financing facilities proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants debt service payments cash flows from financing activities  net the following sections provide a more detailed discussion of our cash flows from financing activities 
committed equity financing facilities ceffs we have entered into four ceffs with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge  a private investment group  in which kingsbridge is committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  newly issued shares of our common stock 
the ceffs allow us  at our discretion  to raise capital at the time and in amounts deemed suitable to us  to support our business plans 
we are not obligated to utilize any of the funds available under the ceffs 
should we choose to utilize any of the ceffs  our ability to access the funds available under the ceffs is subject to certain conditions  including stock price and volume limitations
