item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses our results of operations and our financial condition 
md a should be read in conjunction with our items business  a risk factors  and properties and our consolidated financial statements in item below 
executive overview the partnership s net income in fiscal was million  which includes million from the sale of its california storage facility  compared with net income of million in fiscal a number of factors contributed to the improved performance 
the most important factor was a significant decline in propane product costs 
commodity prices for propane declined precipitously as we entered our critical winter heating season during the first quarter of fiscal following a significant increase in propane prices during most of the second half of fiscal as a result of the decline in propane commodity prices we realized higher than normal retail unit margins 
although propane commodity prices rose later in fiscal from earlier fiscal low levels  propane costs were less volatile during much of fiscal and at the end of fiscal remained more than lower than such prices at the end of fiscal as previously mentioned  results in fiscal benefited from the partnership s november sale of its california lpg storage facility which increased our net income by million and resulted in net cash proceeds to the partnership of approximately million 
during fiscal  our delivery expenses benefited from lower vehicle fuel prices 
average temperatures during the fiscal heating season were slightly colder than the prior year 
partially offsetting these beneficial factors in fiscal were the effects of the economic recession on economic activity and customer conservation 
the effects of the economic recession were particularly evident in our commercial business  notably our reduced forklift volumes  and to a lesser extent in our reduced residential volumes 
looking ahead  our fiscal results will be influenced by a number of factors including temperatures during the heating season months  the length and severity of the economic recession and the level and volatility of commodity prices for propane 
as previously mentioned  the precipitous decline in propane commodity prices in fiscal resulted in higher than normal unit margins 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity in the forms of revolving credit facilities and letters of credit to fund business operations for the foreseeable future 
due in large part to declining commodity prices for propane  fiscal cash flow was stronger than fiscal as our investment in working capital  principally inventories and accounts receivable  declined 
we finished fiscal with million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facilities 

table of contents analysis of results of operations the following analyses compares the partnership s results of operations for fiscal with fiscal and fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal 
the following table provides gallons sold  weather and certain financial information for the partnership and should be read in conjunction with the sections fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal below 
year ended september  millions of dollars  except where noted gallons sold millions retail wholesale revenues retail propane wholesale propane other total margin a ebitda b operating income net income c degree days warmer than normal d a total margin represents total revenues less cost of sales propane and cost of sales other 
b earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
management believes ebitda is a meaningful non gaap financial measure used by investors to compare the partnership s operating performance with other companies within the propane industry and assess its ability to meet loan covenants 
the partnership s definition of ebitda may be different from that used by other companies 
management uses ebitda to compare year over year profitability of the business without regard to capital structure as well as to compare the relative performance of the partnership to that of other master limited partnerships without regard to their financing methods  capital structure  income taxes or historical cost basis 
in view of the omission of interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization from ebitda  management also assesses the profitability of the business by comparing net income for the relevant years 
management also uses ebitda to assess the partnership s profitability because its parent  ugi corporation  uses the partnership s ebitda to assess the profitability of the partnership 
ugi corporation discloses the partnership s ebitda as the profitability measure to comply with the gaap requirement to provide profitability information about its domestic propane segment 
ebitda in fiscal and fiscal includes the effects of pre tax gains of million and million  respectively  from the sales of lpg storage facilities 
the following table includes reconciliations of net income to ebitda for the periods presented year ended september  net income income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda c net income in fiscal and fiscal includes net income of million and million  respectively  from the sales of lpg storage facilities 
d deviation from average heating degree days for the year period based upon national weather statistics provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for airports in the united states  excluding alaska 
fiscal data has been adjusted to correct a noaa error 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal based upon heating degree day data  average temperatures in our service territories during fiscal were warmer than normal compared with temperatures in the prior year that were warmer than normal 
fiscal retail gallons sold were lower than fiscal reflecting  among other things  the adverse effects of the significant deterioration in general economic activity which has occurred over the last year and continued customer conservation 
during fiscal  average wholesale propane commodity prices at mont belvieu  texas  one of the major supply points in the us  were more than lower than such prices in fiscal the decrease in the average wholesale commodity prices in fiscal reflects the effects of a precipitous decline in commodity propane prices principally during the first quarter of fiscal following a substantial increase in prices during most of the second half of fiscal although wholesale propane prices in fiscal rebounded modestly from prices experienced earlier in the year  at september  such prices remained approximately lower than at september  retail propane revenues declined million in fiscal reflecting a million decrease as a result of the lower retail volumes sold and a million decrease due to lower average selling prices 
wholesale propane revenues declined million reflecting an million decrease from lower wholesale selling prices partially offset by a million increase from higher wholesale volumes sold 
total cost of sales decreased million to  million principally reflecting the effects of the previously mentioned lower propane commodity prices and the lower volumes sold 
total margin was million greater in fiscal reflecting the beneficial impact of higher than normal retail unit margins resulting from the previously mentioned rapid decline in propane commodity costs that occurred primarily as we entered the critical winter heating season in the first quarter of fiscal the increase of total propane margin was partially offset by lower terminal revenue and ancillary sales and fee income 
the million increase in fiscal ebitda reflects the effects of a million pre tax gain from the november sale of the partnership s california lpg storage facility and the previously mentioned million increase in total margin 
these increases were partially offset by slightly higher operating and administrative expenses and slightly lower other income 
the slightly higher operating and administrative expenses reflect  in large part  higher compensation and benefit expenses  higher costs associated with facility maintenance projects  and higher litigation and self insured liability and casualty charges offset principally by lower vehicle fuel expenses due to lower propane  diesel and gasoline prices and lower fiscal uncollectible accounts expense 
operating income increased million in fiscal reflecting the previously mentioned million increase in ebitda partially offset by slightly higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with acquisitions and plant and equipment expenditures made since the prior year 
fiscal compared with fiscal based upon heating degree day data  average temperatures in our service territories were warmer than normal in fiscal compared with temperatures that were warmer than normal in fiscal notwithstanding the slightly colder fiscal weather and the full year benefits of acquisitions made in fiscal  retail gallons sold were slightly lower reflecting  among other things  customer conservation in response to increasing propane product costs and a weak economy 
the average wholesale propane cost at mont belvieu  texas  increased nearly during fiscal over the average cost during fiscal retail propane revenues increased million in fiscal reflecting a million increase due to the higher average selling prices partially offset by a million decrease as a result of the lower retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues increased million in fiscal reflecting a million increase from higher average wholesale selling prices partially offset by a million decrease from lower wholesale volumes sold 
total cost of sales increased million to  million in fiscal reflecting higher propane product costs 

table of contents total margin was million greater in fiscal principally reflecting higher average propane margin per retail gallon sold and  to a much lesser extent  higher fee income 
ebitda in fiscal was million compared to ebitda of million in fiscal fiscal ebitda includes million resulting from the sale of the partnership s arizona storage facility 
excluding the effects of this gain in fiscal  ebitda in fiscal increased million over fiscal principally reflecting the previously mentioned increase in total margin partially offset by a million increase in operating and administrative expenses 
the increased operating expenses reflect expenses associated with acquisitions  increased vehicle fuel and maintenance expenses  greater general insurance expense and  to a lesser extent  higher uncollectible accounts expenses largely attributable to the higher revenues 
the partnership s operating income decreased million in fiscal reflecting the lower ebitda and higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the full year effects of fiscal propane business acquisitions and plant and equipment expenditures 
financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the partnership s debt outstanding at september  totaled million including current maturities of long term debt of million 
total debt outstanding at september  includes long term debt comprising million of amerigas partners senior notes  million of amerigas olp first mortgage notes and million of other long term debt 
in march  amerigas olp repaid million of its first mortgage notes with cash generated from operations 
amerigas olp s short term borrowing needs are seasonal and are typically greatest during the fall and winter heating season months due to the need to fund higher levels of working capital 
in order to meet its short term cash needs  amerigas olp has a million credit agreement credit agreement which expires on october  amerigas olp s credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million acquisition facility 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general purposes of amerigas olp 
the acquisition facility provides amerigas olp with the ability to borrow up to million to finance the purchase of propane businesses or propane business assets or  to the extent it is not so used  for working capital and general purposes 
in order to provide for increased liquidity  on april   amerigas olp entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility supplemental credit agreement with three major banks 
the supplemental credit agreement expires on july  and permits amerigas olp to borrow up to million for working capital and general purposes 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements at september  issued and outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  which reduce the amount available for borrowings  totaled million at september  the average daily and peak bank loan borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the average daily and peak bank loan borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the higher peak bank loan borrowings in fiscal resulted from the need to fund counterparty cash collateral obligations associated with derivative financial instruments used by the partnership to manage price risk associated with fixed sales price commitments to customers 
these collateral obligations resulted from the precipitous decline in propane commodity prices that occurred early in fiscal at september   the partnership s available borrowing capacity under the credit agreements was million 
based on existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations  and borrowings available under amerigas olp s credit agreement and the supplemental credit agreement  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs during fiscal for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  see note to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents partnership distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in a total amount equal to its available cash as defined in the fourth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership  the partnership agreement for such quarter 
available cash generally means cash on hand at the end of such quarter  plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of determination resulting from borrowings after the end of such quarter  less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion 
the general partner may establish reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership s business and for distributions during the next four quarters 
in addition  certain of the partnership s debt agreements require reserves be established for the payment of debt principal and interest 
distributions of available cash are made to limited partners and to the general partner giving effect to the interest of the general partner in distributions of available cash from amerigas olp to amerigas partners until available cash exceeds the minimum quarterly distribution of and the first target distribution of per common unit or a total of per common unit 
if available cash exceeds per common unit in any quarter  the general partner will receive a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution but only with respect to the amount by which the distribution per common unit to limited partners exceeds 
quarterly distributions of available cash per limited partner unit paid during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were as follows fiscal st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter because the partnership made distributions to common unitholders in excess of per limited partner unit beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the general partner has received a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution than its aggregate general partner interest in amerigas partners and amerigas olp 
the total amount of distributions received by the general partner with respect to its general partner interest in amerigas partners during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal totaled million  million and million  respectively  which amounts included incentive distributions of million  million and million  respectively 
on july   the general partner s board of directors approved a distribution of per common unit payable on august  to unitholders of record on august  this distribution includes the regular quarterly distribution of per common unit and per common unit reflecting a one time distribution of a portion of the proceeds from the partnership s sale of its california storage facility in november on july   the general partner s board of directors approved a distribution of per common unit payable on august  to unitholders of record on august  this distribution included the regular quarterly distribution of per common unit and per common unit reflecting a one time distribution of a portion of the proceeds from the partnership s sale of its arizona storage facility in july cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the partnership s business  cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane consumed during the heating season months 
conversely  operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when the partnership s investment in working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  is generally greatest 
the partnership may use its credit agreements to satisfy its seasonal operating cash flow needs 

table of contents cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the year over year increase in cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital during the three year period ended september  principally reflects improved year over year operating results 
cash provided used to fund changes in operating working capital totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the greater cash provided by changes in operating working capital in fiscal reflects lower net cash required to fund changes in accounts receivable and inventories due in large part to the effects of declining wholesale propane product costs 
this increase in cash provided by changes in accounts receivable and inventory was partially offset by the impact of the timing of payments and the decrease in current year period propane product costs on accounts payable 
cash flow from changes in operating working capital in fiscal also reflects reimbursements of million of counterparty collateral deposits paid in fiscal the greater cash required to fund operating working capital in fiscal compared with fiscal principally reflects the impact of increases in propane prices and timing of cash receipts on cash flow from changes in accounts receivables and net collateral deposits of million associated with commodity derivative instruments 
investing activities 
investing activity cash flow is principally affected by expenditures for property  plant and equipment  cash paid for acquisitions of businesses and proceeds from sales of assets

also during fiscal  the partnership acquired several retail propane distribution businesses  including the retail distribution businesses of all star gas corporation and shell gas lpg usa  and several cylinder refurbishing businesses for total net cash consideration of million 
financing activities 
changes in cash flow from financing activities are primarily due to distributions on amerigas partners common units  issuances and repayments of long term debt  borrowings under credit agreements  and issuances of amerigas partners common units 
cash flow used by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal distributions in fiscal and fiscal include an additional and per common unit to distribute a portion of the proceeds from the partnership s november and july sales of storage facility assets  respectively 
during fiscal  amerigas olp repaid million of maturing first mortgage notes using cash generated from operations 
capital expenditures in the following table  we present capital expenditures which exclude acquisitions for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we also provide amounts we expect to spend in fiscal we expect to finance fiscal capital expenditures principally from cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit agreements 
year ended september  millions of dollars estimate property  plant and equipment expenditures the greater fiscal and fiscal capital expenditures include expenditures associated with a partnership system software replacement 

table of contents contractual cash obligations and commitments the partnership has certain contractual cash obligations that extend beyond fiscal including obligations associated with long term debt  interest on long term fixed rate debt  lease obligations  derivative instruments and propane supply contracts 
the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by period fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and millions of dollars total thereafter long term debt a interest on long term fixed rate debt b operating leases derivative financial instruments c propane supply contracts other purchase obligations d total a based upon stated maturity dates

the partnership sold propane to certain affiliates of ugi 
such amounts were not material during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have an effect on the partnership s financial condition  change in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
commodity price risk the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs and the partnership generally passes on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully or on a timely basis  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
these derivative financial instruments contain collateral provisions 
in order to minimize our credit risk associated with derivative commodity contracts  we monitor established credit limits with our contract counterparties 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents interest rate risk the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact their fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact their cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under amerigas olp s credit agreements 
these agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements 
based upon the average level of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements in fiscal  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time we enter into interest rate protection agreements 
the following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instruments held at september  and it also includes the changes in fair value that would result if there were a ten percent adverse change in the market price of propane and the three month libor fair value asset change in millions of dollars liability fair value september  propane swap and option contracts interest rate protection agreements september  propane swap and option contracts interest rate protection agreements because the partnership s derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane price or interest rate risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated anticipated transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of the partnership s operations and the use of estimates made by management 
the partnership has identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
changes in these policies could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies necessarily requires management s most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  with its audit committee 
in addition  management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 

table of contents litigation accruals and environmental liabilities 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business and may own sites at which hazardous substances may be present 
in accordance with gaap  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions or environmental remediation liabilities when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets other than goodwill using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
as of september   our net property  plant and equipment totaled million 
depreciation expense of million was recorded during fiscal purchase price allocation 
from time to time  we enter into material business combinations 
in accordance with accounting guidance associated with business combinations  the purchase price is allocated to the various assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value 
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal 
estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment 
estimates most commonly impact property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  including those with indefinite lives 
generally  we have  if necessary  up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize the purchase price allocation 
newly adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of accounting guidance we adopted in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal as well as recently issued accounting guidance not yet adopted
