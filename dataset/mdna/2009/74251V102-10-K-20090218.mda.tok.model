financial results of the corporate segment primarily reflect our financing activities including interest expense  income on capital not allocated to other segments  inter segment eliminations  income tax risks and certain income  expenses and other after tax adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items 
economic factors and trends the significant decline in the equity markets during  which was partially offset by positive net cash flows  has led to decreases in our us asset accumulation segment s account values and our global asset management segment s aum 
since account values and aum are the base by which these businesses generate profits  the decline in account values and aum has put pressure on our profits 
in addition  the credit market disruptions in resulted in an increase in our realized capital losses  which are reflected in net income  and unrealized capital losses  which are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in our international asset management and accumulation segment  we continued to grow our business through organic growth in our existing subsidiaries and through new joint ventures and strategic acquisitions 
additionally  the global credit market disruptions  market illiquidity  and foreign currency depreciation during the second half of resulted in a decrease in our international asset management and accumulation segment s aum and an increase in our unrealized capital losses  which are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in our life and health segment  we continue to shift the marketing emphasis of our individual life insurance business to universal life insurance products from traditional life insurance products 
in our health insurance and fee for service businesses we continue to experience membership declines due to lower sales and higher lapses 
our specialty benefits insurance business is experiencing a slowdown in growth relative to prior years due to a combination of lower sales and higher lapses  as well as reduced growth in salaries and the number of covered lives of our existing customers 
this slowdown is a direct reflection of the increasingly competitive marketplace and economic pressures facing our customers 
given the aforementioned market conditions  and our expectation that these very challenging financial and operating conditions  which have continued into  will not improve significantly in the short term  we have built additional liquidity by increasing cash and cash equivalent holdings 
currently  new cash inflows are primarily being invested in cash  short term government backed securities and other liquid investments 
as a result of increased cash holdings  current yields will be lower than historically experienced 
this trend is expected to continue as long as market conditions remain strained and we continue to invest new cash inflows in cash and liquid investments
