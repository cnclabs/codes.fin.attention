item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with  and we qualify our discussion in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere within this annual report  the material contained in the risk factors and description of business sections of this annual report  and the cautionary disclosure about forward looking statements at the front of part i of this annual report 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets innovative  proprietary products for the treatment of voiding dysfunctions 
our primary focus is on two products our urgent pc system  which we believe is the only fda approved minimally invasive  office based neurostimulation therapy for the treatment of urinary urgency  urinary frequency  and urge incontinence symptoms often associated with overactive bladder oab  and macroplastique  a urethral bulking agent for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence primarily due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency isd 
we believe physicians prefer our products because they offer an effective therapy for the patient  can be administered in office based settings and  to the extent reimbursement is in place  provide the physicians a new profitable recurring revenue stream 
we believe patients prefer our products because they are minimally invasive treatment alternatives and that do not have the side effects associated with pharmaceutical treatment options nor the morbidity associated with surgery 
our sales growth in fiscal period over a year ago was influenced by the growing success we had in the first six months of fiscal with sales of our urgent pc system in the us in the second half of fiscal  sales in the us of our urgent pc system declined over the corresponding year ago period because of reimbursement related issues 
our results were also impacted by the steadily increasing sales in the us of our macroplastique product because of our increased sales and marketing focus 
with the benefit of increased manufacturing capacity utilization  cost reductions and increase in average selling price of certain products  we have realized increased gross margins 
although we have incurred increased selling and marketing  and research and development expenses  primarily to support the growth in our us business  the increased sales and the improvement in gross margins  together with relatively stable general and administrative expenses  have allowed us to slightly decrease our net loss in fiscal in the second half of fiscal  our sales declined over the corresponding year ago period in part due to reimbursement related issues for urgent pc treatments in the us the american medical association has advised the medical community that their previously recommended listed cpt code for reimbursement of urgent pc treatments be replaced with an unlisted code 
some third party insurance carriers are now reassessing their coverage and reimbursement policies for urgent pc treatments 
however  many other third party payors  under a 
table of contents published positive coverage policy or on a case by case basis  continue to reimburse for urgent pc treatments 
we are working with third party payors to clarify the reimbursement process and have commissioned additional clinical studies that we anticipate may assist in obtaining a specific listed cpt code for percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation that will encourage broader use of our urgent pc 
in fiscal we spent approximately million and in fiscal anticipate spending approximately million for such clinical studies 
we specifically increased our emphasis on sales of our macroplastique product in the united states during the second half of fiscal  and particularly in the quarter ended march  we expanded our marketing activities and conducted specific sales training programs with our us sales representatives to increase their ability to understand and advise clinicians as to its use and benefits with the expectation of increased sales 
we anticipate increased sales of this product in fiscal critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts  giving due consideration to materiality 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are particularly important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial position 
they may require the application of a higher level of judgment by uroplasty management  and as a result are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
we believe our revenue recognition policies comply with sab we recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our distributors and direct customers 
we have no customer acceptance provisions or installation obligations 
our sales terms to our distributors and customers provide no right of return outside of our standard warranty  and payment terms consistent with industry standards apply 
sales terms and pricing to our distributors are governed by the respective distribution agreements 
our distributors purchase our products to meet the sales demand of their end user customers as well as to fulfill their internal requirements associated with the sales process and  if applicable  contractual purchase requirements under the respective distribution agreements 
internal and other requirements include purchases of products for training  demonstration and evaluation purposes  clinical evaluations  product support  establishing inventories  and meeting minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  the level of our net sales during any period is not necessarily indicative of our distributors sales to end user customers during that period  which we estimate are not substantially different than our sales to those distributors in each of the last two years 
our distributors level of inventories of our products  their sales to end user customers and their internal product requirements may impact our future revenue growth 
accounts receivable 
we carry our accounts receivable at the original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a periodic review of all outstanding amounts 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the customer s financial health  and both historical and expected credit loss experience 
we write off our accounts receivable when we deem them uncollectible 
we record recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off when received 
we are not always able to or timely obtain changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
historically  the accounts receivable balances we have written off have generally been within our expectations 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we provide lower of cost or market reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon current and expected future product sales and the expected impact of product transitions or modifications 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
while we expect our sales to grow  a reduction in sales could reduce the demand for our 
table of contents products and may require additional inventory reserves 
historically  inventories we have written off have generally been within our expectations 
foreign currency translation transactions 
the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries were translated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
under this statement  we translate all assets and liabilities using period end exchange rates  and we translate statements of operations items using average exchange rates for the period 
we record the resulting translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses in the statement of operations  including unrealized gains and losses on short term intercompany obligations using period end exchange rates  resulting in an increase in the volatility of our consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets at march  consist of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if we consider such assets impaired  we measure the impairment to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we did not record any impairment charge in fiscal years or share based compensation 
fasb published sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r requires that we recognize the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  in our financial statements 
we must measure that cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
defined benefit pension plans 
we have a liability attributed to defined benefit pension plans we offered to certain former and current employees prior to april we pay premiums to an insurance company to fund annuities and are responsible for funding additional annuities based on continued service and future salary increases for these employees pension benefit 
the liability is dependent upon numerous factors  assumptions and estimates  and the continued benefit costs we incur may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate  compensation rates  or retirement dates used to determine the projected benefit obligation 
additionally  changes made to the provisions of the plans may impact current and future benefit costs 
in accordance with accounting rules  changes in benefit obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement  but are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
as of march   we have generated approximately million in us net operating loss carryforwards that we cannot use to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
we recognize a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the deferred tax asset 
we have established a valuation allowance for us and certain foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty that we will generate enough income in those taxing jurisdictions to utilize the assets 
in addition  future utilization of nol carryforwards are subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
this section generally relates to a percent change in ownership of a company over a three year period 
we believe that the issuance of our common stock in the december follow on public offering resulted in an ownership change under section accordingly  our ability to use nol tax attributes generated prior to december may be limited 

table of contents results of operations net sales 
in fiscal  net sales were million  representing a million or increase compared to net sales of million in fiscal excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  net sales increased by approximately 
our fiscal sales over the corresponding periods in fiscal increased percent in the first half of the year and declined percent in the second half of the year 
we had growing success with sales of our urgent pc system in the us in the first half of fiscal over the corresponding period in fiscal  but those sales declined in the second half of fiscal because of reimbursement related issues 
partially offsetting this decline was the growing sales of macroplastique product in the us the second half slowdown in sales outside of the us is attributed primarily to a decline in macroplastique related products due to increased competition in foreign countries and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
sales to customers in the us in fiscal totaled million  representing a million or percent increase compared to million in fiscal we attribute this growth to sales of macroplastique product and to the sales growth  in the first half of the fiscal year  of the urgent pc system 
sales of our macroplastique product  which we launched in late  increased to million compared to sales of million in fiscal sales of our macroplastique product have steadily increased because of our increased sales and marketing focus in the current fiscal year 
sales of our urgent pc system increased to million compared to million in fiscal however  all the growth in sales of the urgent pc system occurred in the first half  and  because of reimbursement related issues  declined in the second half of fiscal we anticipate sales of our macroplastique product in the us to continue to grow in fiscal as we expect to benefit from our increased sales and marketing effort 
we do not expect that we will be able to return to significant sales growth or return to the historic sales level of urgent pc in the us until a new listed cpt code is assigned and adequate reimbursement provided 
sales to customers outside the us in fiscal were million  representing a million or decrease compared to million in fiscal excluding the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  sales decreased by approximately 
in fiscal  the us dollar against our foreign currency denominated sales was weaker in the first half  creating a favorable benefit on translated sales  and was stronger in the second half  creating an unfavorable benefit on translated sales  over corresponding year ago periods 
our sales increased in the first half  primarily due the favorable impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the second half  sales declined 
about one half approximately million of this decline is attributed to the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in exchange rates  with the rest attributed primarily to decline in macroplastique related products due to increased competition 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  or and of net sales in the respective periods 
we attribute the higher gross profit percentage in fiscal mainly to the percentage point favorable impact of product mix and cost reductions attributed to our urgent pc system 
in addition  in fiscal we had incurred  for rent and lease exit charges due to the discontinuation of manufacturing at our eindhoven  the netherlands facility 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in fiscal was a  non cash charge for share based employee compensation  compared with a charge of  in fiscal excluding share based compensation charges  g a expenses increased by  research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the increase in spending for fiscal primarily due to an increase in spending for clinical studies 
we have commissioned additional clinical studies that we anticipate may assist us in obtaining the specific listed cpt code that will encourage broader use of our urgent pc 
in fiscal we spent approximately million  compared with million in fiscal on clinical studies  and in fiscal we anticipate spending of approximately million for such clinical studies 

table of contents selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the increase to a  increase in compensation related costs  primarily as a result of increased salaries  a  increase in consulting costs to support our efforts to secure reimbursement for urgent pc treatments in the us  and an increase in other costs to support our expanded sales organization and marketing activities 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expenses of intangibles were  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
our amortization expense is attributed primarily to our april acquisition for million certain intellectual property assets related to the urgent pc system 
we are amortizing this acquisition cost over six years 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest income  interest expense  warrant expense  foreign currency exchange gains and losses and other non operating costs when incurred 
other income was  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest income decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal because of lower average invested cash balance and decreased interest rates 
we recognize exchange gains and losses primarily as a result of fluctuations in currency rates between the us dollar the functional reporting currency and the euro and british pound currencies of our subsidiaries  as well as their effect on the dollar denominated intercompany obligations between us and our foreign subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances are revolving in nature and we do not deem them to be long term balances 
we recognized net foreign currency exchange loss of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
income tax expense we recorded income tax expense of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the income tax expense we recorded is attributed primarily to our operations in netherlands 
in fiscal we recorded an income tax charge of  for a settlement we reached with the netherlands tax authorities for income tax liability for fiscal years to we cannot use our us net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
non gaap financial measures 
the following table reconciles our financial results calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap to non gaap financial measures that exclude non cash charges for share based compensation  and depreciation and amortization expenses from gross profit  operating expenses and operating loss 
the non gaap financial measures used by management and disclosed by us are not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures and consolidated financial results calculated in accordance with gaap  and you should carefully evaluate our reconciliations to non gaap 
we may calculate our non gaap financial measures differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to those used by other companies 
we have described the reconciliations of each of our non gaap financial measures above to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
we use these non gaap financial measures  and in particular non gaap operating loss  for internal managerial purposes because we believe such measures are one important indicator of the strength and the performance of our business as they provide a link to operating cash flow 
we also believe that analysts and investors use such measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry  including as a means of comparing period to period results and as a means of evaluating our results with those of other companies 
our non gaap operating loss for fiscal and was approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents years ended march  non gaap gross profit gaap gross profit of sales share based compensation depreciation expenses non gaap gross profit non gaap operating expenses gaap operating expenses share based compensation depreciation expenses amortization expenses non gaap operating expenses non gaap operating loss gaap operating loss share based compensation depreciation expenses amortization expenses non gaap operating loss liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
at march   our cash and cash equivalent and short term investments balances totaled million 
at march   we had working capital of approximately million 
in fiscal  we used million of cash in operating activities  compared to million of cash used in fiscal we attribute the decrease in cash used in operating activities primarily to the increase in sales for the year  an improvement in gross profit rate and a reduction in accounts receivable primarily because of a reduction fourth fiscal quarter sales over the corresponding year ago period  offset partially by a reduction accrued liabilities primarily because of a reduction in management bonuses on lower than planned operating financial performance 
in fiscal we used approximately  to purchase property  plant and equipment compared with approximately  in fiscal in fiscal we used cash in financing activities of approximately  to retire debt  while in fiscal we generated approximately million of cash in financing activities  comprised of approximately million we generated from issuance of common stock and exercise of warrants and options 
sources of liquidity 
in november  we conducted a secondary offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the stock sale proceeds are offset by costs of approximately  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in september we entered into a one year business loan agreement with venture bank 
the agreement provides for a credit line of up to million secured by the assets of our company 
we may borrow up to to a maximum of  of the value of our eligible inventory on hand and of the value of our eligible us accounts receivable  provided  however  our total liabilities  inclusive of the amount borrowed  may not exceed our tangible net worth 
to be eligible to borrow any amount  we must maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million 
interest on the loan is charged at a per annum rate of the greater of or 
table of contents one percentage point over the prime rate prime rate on march  
at march   we had no borrowings outstanding on this credit line 
uroplasty bv  our subsidiary  has an agreement with rabobank of the netherlands for a  approximately  credit line secured by our facility in geleen  the netherlands 
the bank charges interest on the loan at the rate of one percentage point over the rabobank base interest rate base rate on march   subject to a minimum interest rate of per annum 
at march   we had no borrowings outstanding on this credit line 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs over the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional financing to support our operations and planned growth activities in the future as we have yet to achieve profitability and generate positive cash flows 
to achieve profitability  we must generate substantially more revenue than we have this year or in prior years 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend  in large part  on our ability to achieve widespread market acceptance for our products and successfully expand our business in the us  which in turn may be partially dependent upon re establishing broad reimbursement for our urgent pc product and successfully demonstrating the superiority of our macroplastique product to clinicians 
we cannot guarantee that we will be entirely successful in either of these pursuits 
if we are unable to raise the needed funds  we may need to curtail our operations including product development  clinical studies and sales and marketing activities 
this would adversely impact our future business and prospects 
ultimately  we will need to achieve profitability and generate positive cash flows from operations to meet our cash needs and grow our business 
commitments and contingencies 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs for clinical studies to support our effort to obtain a specific listed cpt code that we anticipate will encourage broader use of our urgent pc system in the us we expect that in fiscal we will spend approximately million for such clinical studies 
we also expect to continue to incur significant expenses to support our us sales and marketing organization  and for regulatory activities 
under a royalty agreement we pay royalties  in the aggregate  of three to five percent of net sales of macroplastique  bioplastique  and ptq implants subject to a monthly minimum of  the royalties payable under this agreement will continue until the patent referenced in the agreement expires in under a license agreement for the macroplastique implantation system  we pay a royalty of british pounds for each unit sold during the life of the patent 
in our normal course of business we have commitments  generally for periods of less than twelve months  to purchase from various vendors finished goods and manufacturing components under issued purchase orders 
we have a defined benefit pension plan covering seven employees in the netherlands 
we pay premiums to an insurance company to fund annuities for these employees 
however  we are responsible for funding additional annuities based on continued service and future salary increases 
we closed this defined benefit plan for new employees in april as of that date  the dutch subsidiary established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees 
we have a defined benefit pension plan for six former employees of our uk subsidiary 
we closed this plan to further accrual for all employees effective december   and  effective march  established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the euro and the british pound 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between our operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volumes within local economies and the impact of any pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
because our products are currently manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states  while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
interest rate risk our primary market risk with financial instruments results from fluctuations in interest rates 
our cash is invested in bank deposits  certificate of deposits and money market funds denominated in us dollars  euros and british pounds 
the carrying value of these instruments approximates fair market value 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and their value could be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 
other matters management regularly reviews our business operations  processes and overall organizational structure with the objective of improving our financial performance 
as a result of this ongoing process to improve financial performance  we may incur restructuring charges in the future which  if taken  could be material to our financial results
