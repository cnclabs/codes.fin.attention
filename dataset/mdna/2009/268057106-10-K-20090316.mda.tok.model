item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business dynamics research corporation  headquartered in andover  massachusetts  is a leading provider of innovative engineering  technical  information technology and management consulting services and solutions to federal and state governments 
we provide support to our customers in the primary mission areas of it  logistics and readiness  systems integration and technical services  cisr  homeland security  health and human services  intelligence space  cyber security  and public and environmental health 
on august   we completed the acquisition of kadix which is more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
the acquisition strengthens and expands our growth as a provider of high end services and solutions in the homeland security and other federal civilian markets 
the operating results of kadix are included in drc s results of operations within the systems and services segment for the period subsequent to the acquisition date 
we have two reportable business segments systems and services  and metrigraphics 
the systems and services segment accounted for approximately of total revenue and the metrigraphics segment accounted for approximately of total revenue in industry we are cognizant of funding challenges and changing priorities of the federal government 
in february  the president made his initial budget submission to congress 
while a more detailed budget will be provided in april  the submission  along with the federal stimulus plan  will provide clear indications of priorities and direction for the new administration 
overall  the budget provides for discretionary spending growth of 
breaking the increase down by sector  the budget proposal reflects growth in funding for civilian agencies and growth in funding for defense 
however  significant contract awards have been and will continue to be delayed and new initiatives have been slow to start 
customers are moving away from the gsa schedule time and materials contracts toward agency sponsored id iq contract vehicles and fixed price contracts and task orders 
the dod seeks to reduce spending on contracted program advisory and assistance services and often is setting this work aside for small businesses 
concurrently  there is increasing demand from federal customers for training  business transformation  lean six sigma  human capital management  cyber security and business intelligence solutions and services 
many federal customers are seeking to streamline their procurement activities by consolidating work under large contract vehicles 
our competitive strategy is intended to align with these trends 
outlook our business is conducted primarily with us government customers under both short term and long term contracts 
we have aligned our service offerings to current economic conditions and customer needs 
the us government s budgetary processes give us good visibility regarding future spending and the threat areas that they are addressing 
management believes that our current contracts  and backlog of previously awarded contracts are well aligned with the direction of our customers future needs  and this provides us with good insight regarding future cash flows 
nonetheless  management recognizes that the current economic situation and significant changes in priorities under the new administration likely will result in significant changes in federal spending with increases in some areas and decreases in others 
while we may benefit from the increases  certain programs in which we participate may be subject to reductions 
based primarily on our current portfolio of customers  contracts and funded backlog of million as of december   we expect revenue in to be in the range of approximately million to million 
critical accounting policies there are business risks specific to the industries in which we operate 
these risks include estimates of costs to complete contract obligations  changes in government policies and procedures  government contracting issues and risks associated with technological development 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents the use of alternative estimates and assumptions and changes in business strategy or market conditions may significantly impact our assets or liabilities  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments made and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our systems and services business segment provides services pursuant to time and materials  cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts  including service type contracts 
for time and materials contracts  revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate  as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs 
the risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract  which would directly affect operating income 
for cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and includes a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
cost reimbursable contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of estimated costs 
the primary risk on a cost reimbursable contract is that a government audit of direct and indirect costs could result in the disallowance of some costs  which would directly impact revenue and margin on the contract 
historically  such audits have not had a material impact on our revenue and operating income 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under fixed price contracts  other than service type contracts  revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the risk on a fixed price contract is estimates of costs to complete the contract may exceed revenues on the contract 
for all types of contracts  we recognize anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable 
out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in contract revenue and cost of contract revenue 
unbilled receivables are the amounts of recoverable contract revenue that have not been billed at the balance sheet date 
unbilled receivables relate principally to revenue that is billed in the month after services are performed 
in certain instances  billing is deferred in compliance with the contract terms  such as milestone billing arrangements and withholdings  or delayed for other reasons 
costs related to certain us government contracts  including applicable indirect costs  are subject to audit by the government 
revenue from such contracts has been recorded at amounts we expect to realize upon final settlement 
our metrigraphics business segment records revenue from product sales upon transfer of both title and risk of loss to the customer  provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and the customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
product sales are recorded net of sales taxes and net of returns upon delivery 
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling is classified as product sales 
the cost of shipping products to the customer is recognized at the time the products are shipped and are recorded as cost of product sales 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of kadix and other businesses in prior years  we acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among other things  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant and reviews of projected cash flows 
we estimate fair value by employing different methodologies  including a comparison to comparable industry companies and discounted cash flows 
the determination of relevant comparable industry companies impacts our assessment of fair value 
should the operating performance of our reporting unit change in comparison to these companies or should the valuation of these companies change  this could impact our assessment of the fair value of the reporting unit 
our discounted cash flow analysis factors in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  factoring in customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
additionally  the discounted cash flow analysis factors in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit 

table of contents as a result of the annual impairment test performed as of december   we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  did not record a charge for impairment 
however  we are unable to assure that goodwill will not be impaired in subsequent periods 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and deferred taxes on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from these positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we review our tax positions on a quarterly basis and more frequently as facts surrounding tax positions change 
based on these future events  we may recognize uncertain tax positions or reverse current uncertain tax positions the impact of which would effect the statement of operations and or the balance sheet 
as part of our process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefits from deferred taxes 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we had a net deferred asset of million at december  we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent a recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
at december   we determined that a valuation allowance was not required 
pension obligations accounting and reporting for our pension plan requires the use of assumptions  including the discount rate and expected rate of return on assets 
these assumptions are used by independent actuaries to determine the value of our pension obligations and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is determined by a spot rate yield curve method 
the spot rate yield curve is employed to match the plan assets cash outflows with the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments 
as of december   the pension plan s measurement date  the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs was 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in annual pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed expected rate of return on plan assets  which is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants  is determined by an annual review of historical long term asset returns and consultation with outside investment advisors 
as of the pension plan s measurement date  the weighted average expected rate of return was 
a decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return would have resulted in an increase in annual pension expense by approximately million 
if assumptions differ materially from actual results in the future  our obligations under the pension plan could also differ materially  potentially requiring us to record an additional pension liability and record additional pension costs 
an actuarial valuation of the pension plan is performed each year 
the results of this actuarial valuation are reflected in the accounting for the pension plan upon determination 
at december   we recorded a pension liability of million in the consolidated balance sheet that represented the underfunded benefit obligation 
litigation  commitments  and contingencies we are subject to a range of claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

table of contents litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
results of operations operating results and results expressed as a percentage of total revenues are as follows year ended december  in millions contract revenue product sales total revenue gross profit on contract revenue gross profit loss on product sales total gross profit selling  general and administrative provision for litigation amortization of intangible assets operating income loss interest expense  net other income  net provision benefit for income taxes cumulative benefit of accounting change  net of tax net income loss totals may not add due to rounding 
these amounts represent a percentage of contract revenues  product sales and total revenues  respectively

table of contents due to the transition into the new caps contract in august and the loss of the air national guard contract in may  partially offset by increased revenues from the naval air system command airspeed subcontract awarded in march in january  we purchased from the centech group  inc  a prime caps contract  on which minimal work was being performed 
while awaiting the government s decision on approval of the contract novation  through the centech contract we have won numerous task order re competitions 
we have received notification that centech s request to novate their caps contract to drc has been denied 
centech and we are currently considering avenues for reconsideration of this decision and continuing to perform as a subcontractor on the centech caps contract 
the esc pass contract was re competed in as a small business set aside and certain engineering work previously performed by us under itsp ii was directed to a new contract for which the company did not receive an award 
the increase in revenues from homeland security in compared to was primarily due to added revenues related to the kadix acquisition and new task orders won in the increase in revenues from other federal civilian agencies in compared to was due to added revenues related to the kadix acquisition and new task orders won in the increase in revenues from federal civilian agencies in compared to was primarily due to added revenues from the fdic contract awarded in november the increase in revenues from state and local government agencies in compared to was primarily due to additional change orders under the state of ohio contract during and with the completion of the implementation phase of the ohio project in october  revenues derived from the project are anticipated at a reduced level in in the second quarter of we began a new child welfare system development project with the state of tennessee which generated million of revenue in the decrease in revenues from state and local government agencies in compared to was primarily due to lower revenues from our contract with the state of ohio  under which a significant portion of the work has been completed  partially offset by higher revenues from our state of colorado contract awarded in april revenues by contract type as a percentage of systems and services segment revenues were as follows year ended december  time and materials cost reimbursable fixed price  including service type contracts prime contract sub contract prime contract revenues increased in compared with as a result of an increasing portion of contracts awarded under drc s agency wide multiple award schedule id iq contracts

product sales product sales for the metrigraphics segment were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from product sales for the metrigraphics segment in compared to primarily was due to higher sales to a new medical device customer 
the decrease in revenue from product sales for the metrigraphics segment in compared to primarily was due to a decrease in medical device sales 
funded backlog our funded backlog was million at december   million at december  and million at december  for  our book to bill ratio was to we expect that substantially all of our backlog at december  will generate revenue during the year ending december  gross profit total gross profit was million  million and million resulting in a gross margin of in  in and in 
table of contents our gross profit on contract revenue was million  million and million resulting in a gross margin of in both and and in the increase in gross profit in compared to was attributable to higher revenues primarily related to the kadix acquisition and lower indirect costs  partially offset by costs associated with workforce reductions 
the increase in gross profit in compared to was primarily attributable to the reduction in low margin subcontractor revenues resulting from the transition to the new caps contract in august as noted above 
we recorded severance costs of million  million and million in cost of contract revenue in  and  respectively 
our gross profit loss on product sales was million  million and million resulting in a gross margin of  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit in compared to was due to higher sales to medical device customers 
the decline in gross profit in compared to was primarily attributable to a lower level of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to the addition of kadix s selling  general and administrative expenses partially offset by continuing cost reduction efforts and lower deferred compensation and stock compensation costs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was a result of cost savings initiatives undertaken in the first half of  which also included higher severance costs 
provision for litigation during and we recorded a provision for litigation of million and million  respectively 
we anticipate paying the million litigation settlement due to the government in the first half of amortization of intangible assets amortization expense  which relates to the amortization of acquired intangible assets  was million in both and  and million in interest expense  net we incurred interest expense totaling million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to lower daily average borrowings and lower average interest rates on our revolver in  partially offset by interest expense associated with the addition of the million term loan used to finance the kadix acquisition in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to a lower outstanding debt balance  partially offset by a higher average interest rate 
the weighted average interest rates on our outstanding revolver borrowings were   and at december   and  respectively 
the average interest rate on our term loan was at december  we recorded approximately million of interest income in each of the three years ended other income  net we recorded net other income of million and million in and  respectively 
in  we recorded million of realized gains resulting from the sale of shares of common shares of lucent technologies  inc in accordance with the equity method of accounting  other income includes recognition of our portion of income or loss related to our equity investments

the effective income tax rate excluding the litigation provision was and in and  respectively  compared to in we have estimated the tax benefits associated with the litigation provision of million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in the income tax rate in compared to is due to adjustments to tax accruals and reserves plus favorable effects of tax credits and state tax audits 

table of contents shares used in computing earnings loss per share weighted average common shares outstanding and common equivalent shares totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in shares in compared to is due to the net loss recorded in  which did not include the dilutive effect of stock options or unvested restricted stock 
the increase in shares in both comparable periods was related to additional shares issued  partially offset by a decreased dilutive effect on employee stock options due to a lower average annual stock price 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating  investing and financing activities as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
at december   the borrowing capacity available under our revolver was million 
our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are subject to trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  economic conditions  government payment practices and contractual matters 
our need for access to funds is dependent on future operating results  our growth and acquisition activity and external conditions 
in light of the current economic situation  we have also evaluated our future liquidity needs  both from a short term and long term basis 
we believe that cash on hand plus cash generated from operations along with cash available under credit lines are expected to be sufficient in to service debt  finance capital expenditures  pay the anticipated settlement of litigation  pay federal and state income taxes and fund the pension plan  if necessary 
to provide for long term liquidity  we believe we can generate substantial positive cash flow  as well as obtain additional capital  if necessary  from the use of subordinated debt or equity 
in the event that our current capital resources are not sufficient to fund requirements  we believe our access to additional capital resources would be sufficient to meet our needs 
we anticipate paying the million litigation settlement due to the government in the first half of this litigation settlement is further described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
we will use available cash on hand and borrow the remaining portion from our revolver 
we anticipate to fully repay amounts borrowed under the revolver related to this borrowing in  however  we may borrow additional funds from our revolver during this time for working capital needs 
we believe that selective acquisitions are an important component of our growth strategy 
we may acquire  from time to time  firms or properties that are aligned with our core capabilities and which complement our customer base 
we will continue to consider acquisition opportunities that align with our strategic objectives  along with the possibility of utilizing the credit facility as a source of financing 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million and million  respectively 
our operating practice is to apply cash received against any outstanding revolving credit facility balances 
when a revolver balance exists  cash balances at the end of the year generally reflect the timing and size of cash receipts at the end of the year 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of million during was primarily attributable to an increase in income from operations  excluding the litigation provision 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in and  respectively 
contract receivables were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
billed receivables increased million in and million in  while unbilled receivables increased million in and decreased million in contract receivables days sales outstanding dso  were days at december  and days at december  federal business dso was days at december  and days at december  the difference between consolidated dso and federal dso was primarily due to our contracts with the states of ohio and tennessee which had balances outstanding at december  of million and million at december  our net deferred tax asset was million at december  compared to a million deferred tax liability at december  the change in deferred taxes was principally associated with the defined benefit pension plan of million and the addition of a deferred tax asset of million for the litigation provision 
our deferred tax liability on unbilled receivables declined to million at december  from million at december  the irs continues to challenge the deferral of income for tax purposes related to our unbilled receivables including the applicability of a letter ruling issued by the irs to us in january which granted to us deferred tax treatment of our unbilled receivables 
this issue was elevated to the irs national office for determination 
on october   we received a notification of ruling from the irs national office 
this correspondence 
table of contents provided clarification regarding the irs position relating to the revenue recognition for unbilled receivables 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this notification 
the resolution with the irs regarding unbilled receivables could result in a change in our accounting method regarding revenue recognition 
this change could result in an acceleration of taxable income and a reversal of certain deferred tax items 
we paid million in income taxes in compared to million in share based compensation decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in is primarily due to the decline in our stock price 
the decrease in is primarily due to the amendment to our employee stock purchase plan espp during the fourth quarter of which resulted in the espp being treated as non compensatory  as more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
as of december  the total unrecognized compensation related to restricted stock awards was million to be recognized over two years 
non cash amortization expense of our acquired intangible assets was million in both and and million in we anticipate that non cash expense for the amortization of intangible assets will increase to approximately million in due to a full year of amortization from the kadix acquisition 
our defined benefit pension plan was underfunded by million at december  and overfunded by million at december  the decline in the plan s funded status in was primarily attributable to the decline in the plan asset performance during the year 
the improvement in the plan s funded status in was primarily attributable to the change in the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations to from 
during and  we recorded pension income of million and million  respectively  compared to pension expense of million in the decrease in pension costs in both comparable periods was due to actions approved by the board of directors to amend the pension plan during the fourth quarter of  which removed the annual benefit inflator for active participants in the plan as of december  no supplemental employer contributions were made in or  and no contribution is required in we anticipate pension expense to be approximately million in due to the decline in plan asset performance in investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million during was primarily attributable to the purchase of kadix 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in on august   we completed the acquisition of kadix as more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
the total purchase price of million included additional contingent consideration related to achievement of earnout objectives of million that was accrued at december  and paid in at december  the purchase price allocation was final and all additional cash consideration had been recorded 
capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
for all years  capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of software  other equipment and leasehold improvements 
we expect discretionary capital expenditures in to be at similar levels as during  we made improvements to our headquarters facility of million in connection with our obligation under the sale and leaseback transaction entered into in we have substantially made all required improvements under the agreement and the letter of credit was released in the first half of financing activities during the third quarter of  we entered into a new unsecured credit facility and an interest rate swap agreement 
the new facility restructured and increased our credit facility to million and provided for a million  five year term loan and a million  five year revolving credit agreement for working capital 
the term loan requires quarterly repayments of million and we expect operating cash flows to be sufficient to fund these repayments 
the swap agreement effectively fixes our interest rate on an initial notional amount of million of the term loan principal at swap fixed rate plus margin throughout the term of the facility 
the facility and swap agreements are more fully described in note and note  respectively  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
during  net cash provided by financing activities of million represented net borrowings under the term loan of million and proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions  partially offset by net repayments of million under our revolver 
the average daily borrowing on our revolver for was million at a weighted average interest rate of  compared to an average daily borrowing of million at a weighted average interest rate of in and an average daily borrowing of million at a weighted average interest rate of in under our then existing revolver during those periods 
also  during 
table of contents we had million outstanding under our term loan for the last five months of at a weighted average interest rate of  compared to our average daily outstanding balance under our then existing acquisition term loans was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
during  net cash used in financing activities of million represented net repayments under our credit facility of million  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
during  net cash used in financing activities of million represented principal payments under the acquisition term loan of million  partially offset by million of net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
the outstanding balances on our previous credit facility  which consisted of an acquisition term loan balance of million and a revolving credit facility balance of million  were paid off and re borrowed under the revolver as part of the credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not utilize or employ any off balance sheet arrangements during the three years ended december   defined as i an obligation under a guarantee contract  ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement  iii an obligation  including a contingent obligation  under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument or iv an obligation  including a contingent obligation  arising out of a variable interest 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  consist of the following payments due by period less than two to four to in millions total one year three years five years thereafter long term debt interest payments operating leases total contractual obligations the contractual amounts above related to interest payments does not include the portion of interest contractually due on our term loan principal balance that is not tied to the interest rate swap because those interest rates are not fixed 
during we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed half of the term loan s principal balance at an interest rate of 
the contractual amounts above related to operating leases do not include the effect of sublease rentals 
the amount of sublease rentals is disclosed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
at december  we had a million litigation reserve recorded in other accrued expenses 
we anticipate paying this settlement in the first half of we will use available cash on hand and borrow the remaining portion from our revolver 
we may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of million as of december  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information on unrecognized tax benefits  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
contingencies we are a party to litigation and other proceedings as referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
except as noted therein we do not presently believe it is reasonably likely that any of these matters would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our evaluation of the likelihood of expenditures related to these matters is subject to change in future periods  depending on then current events and circumstances  which could have material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements a description of recent accounting pronouncements are referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
impact of inflation and changing prices overall  inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
additionally  the terms of dod contracts  which accounted for approximately of total revenue in  are generally one year contracts and include salary increase factors for future years  reducing the potential impact of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our term loan and revolver  where interest payments are tied to either the libor or prime rate 
the interest rate at december  on our million term loan was 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate the floating interest rate risk on half of our outstanding term loan 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on half of our outstanding term loan at excluding the applicable margin of 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest expense as reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
our potential loss over one year that would result in a hypothetical and instantaneous increase of one full percentage point in the interest rate on half of our term loan would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in addition  historically our investment positions have been relatively small and short term in nature 
we typically invest excess cash in money market accounts with original maturities of three months or less with no exposure to market interest rates 
we have no significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
foreign sales  which are nominal  are primarily denominated in us dollars
