item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with bancorp s financial statements and related notes thereto  included in part ii item of this report 
average balances  including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios  are generally comprised of average daily balances

executive summary since  financial markets have been experiencing significant disruptions beginning with dramatic declines in the housing market leading to declines in home values and increased foreclosures followed by an economic recession and high unemployment rates 
for the banking industry  this has led to increased loan losses and significantly reduced liquidity 
despite difficult economic conditions  we continue to produce solid results  and we achieved billion in assets by year end  a milestone for us 
earnings were stable at million for the year  loan growth in was exceptional at million and deposits increased million during the year 
we grew our loan portfolio without compromising our prudent underwriting standards 
the year end deposit balance includes a million short term deposit placed with us in the last week of december that was held approximately two weeks 
excluding this short term deposit  growth in totaled million 
we were able to take advantage of exceptionally low market borrowing rates to fund loan growth in excess of deposit growth 
both our taxable equivalent net interest margin and our efficiency ratio showed significant year over year improvement as described below 
while we serve an affluent community  we are not immune from the impact of the national economic recession 
earnings were affected by a loan loss provision charged to expense of million in compared to thousand in net charge offs totaled million in compared to thousand in the charge offs in primarily relate to commercial and construction loans secured by real property where the value of collateral has declined 
recovery of the losses  if any  will depend on the value of the collateral when the property is sold 
loan charge offs represent less than of our loan portfolio 
non accrual loans at december  of million represented of our loan portfolio 
in october  the federal government announced various programs under the emergency economic stabilization act of intended to inject liquidity and stabilize the financial industry 
as of february   the us treasury has injected billion of capital into financial institutions through the purchase of preferred stock under the billion tcpp which was carved out of the billion tarp funds 
initially billion of tcpp funds were given to the nine largest banks in the nation to bolster their capital 
the remaining billion was set aside to enhance the capital of financially sound banks and to promote responsible lending 
in november  we were approved for participation in the tcpp 
on december   we received million in capital under the program through our issuance of preferred stock and warrants to purchase our common stock 
following receipt of the tcpp funds  we deployed billion of the funds into loans through the end of on february   our board of directors approved a resolution to repurchase all  shares of outstanding preferred stock following the u 
s government s recent actions  interpretations  and commentary regarding various aspects of the tcpp program  as we have determined that continued participation in the tcpp is not in the best interests of our common shareholders  customers or our employees  and it would impede our ability to compete 
we have notified the us treasury of our intent to repurchase the preferred stock issued under the tcpp 
the repurchase is subject to bank regulatory approval 
in the fourth quarter of  we elected to participate in the fdic s transaction account guarantee program  which provides unlimited fdic insurance coverage to our depositors  effective october  on transaction accounts until december   by paying a basis point surcharge on top of our current fdic assessment rate 
this insurance is in addition to the fdic increase in insurance coverage from thousand to thousand on all deposit accounts during the same period

table of contents bank of marin bancorp our tax equivalent net interest margin improved basis points in the year to 
a combination of lower deposit and borrowing rates and a shift in interest earning assets from federal funds sold to higher yielding loans contributed to the expansion 
beginning in september and continuing through december  the federal reserve lowered its target interest rate by basis points  bringing the target interest rate to a historic low with a range of to 
loan yields did not fall as dramatically since the yield on fixed rate loans  which comprise over half of the loan portfolio  remained relatively unchanged 
in addition  some variable rate loans have reached negotiated rate floors 
we lowered deposit offering rates eight times in in response to declines in the federal funds rate resulting in a lower cost of funds 
the largest factors likely to affect our net interest margin in will be the volume of loan and deposits  which will in turn influence our liquidity level and the level of borrowing  the federal funds target rate  which is expected to rise in late  as well as our responsiveness to competitive pricing on loans and deposits in our market 
our efficiency ratio improved to in from in significantly higher net interest income and strong growth in non interest income combined with only modest growth in non interest expense has resulted in a marked improvement in efficiency 
in the beginning of  we recorded a non recurring pre tax gain of thousand related to the mandatory redemption of shares in visa  inc and the reversal of a thousand pre tax charge for the potential obligation to visa inc in connection with certain indemnifications provided to visa inc by visa member banks 
in  we recorded a non recurring pre tax gain of thousand on the sale of the indirect auto portfolio and a pre tax gain on the sale of the visa credit card portfolio 
we continue to expand our franchise with the opening of a new branch in downtown mill valley in june of and we are in the process of securing a site for an additional branch in greenbrae  which is projected to open in page

on july   the holding company  bank of marin bancorp  acquired the bank as its wholly owned subsidiary

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has determined the following five accounting policies to be critical allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment in investment securities  share based payment  accounting for income taxes and fair value option for financial assets and liabilities 
allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses is based upon estimates of loan losses and is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge offs 
in periodic evaluations of the adequacy of the allowance balance  management considers our past loan loss experience by type of credit  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors 
we formally assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of loans based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are reviewed as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower and or when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of default 
larger problem loans are monitored continuously and formal impairment analysis for the purpose of applying statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
occurs at least quarterly 
our method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes specific allowances for identified problem loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  economic factors 
allowances for identified problem loans are based on specific analysis of individual credits 
loss estimation factors for loan categories are based on analysis of local economic factors applicable to each loan category 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management s best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the loan portfolio as a whole 
other than temporary impairment in investment securities at each financial statement date  we assess whether declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their costs are deemed to be other than temporary 
we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
evidence evaluated includes  but is not limited to  the remaining payment terms of the instrument and economic factors that are relevant to the collectability of the instrument  such as current prepayment speeds  the current financial condition of the issuer s  industry analyst reports  credit ratings  credit default rates  interest rate trends and the value of any underlying collateral 
other than temporary impairment results in a charge to earnings and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security

table of contents bank of marin bancorp share based payment on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires that all share based payments  including stock options and nonvested restricted common shares  be recognized as an expense in the income statement based on the grant date fair value of the award with a corresponding increase to common stock 
we determine the fair value of stock options at grant date using the black scholes pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date  the exercise price  the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock based award and stock price volatility 
the estimates used in the model involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded stock based compensation expense could have been materially different from that reflected in these financial statements 
the fair value of nonvested restricted common shares generally equals the stock price at grant date 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those share based awards expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
for additional discussion of sfas no 
r  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
accounting for income taxes income taxes reported in the financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business 
bancorp files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb no 
fin establishes a more likely than not recognition threshold that must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the financial statements 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold  an enterprise may recognize only the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
management believed that all tax positions met the more likely than not recognition threshold  therefore  there were no adjustments to retained earnings as a consequence of adopting fin no 
and no subsequent adjustments to the provision for income taxes related to fin to the extent tax authorities disagree with these tax positions  our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities and fair value measurements effective january   we elected early adoption of fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
and fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  and elected the fair value option for our indirect auto loan portfolio  which was subsequently sold 
the changes in fair value of the portfolio after the initial adoption at each balance sheet date were recorded through earnings prior to the sale on june  we determined fair value at january  and march  based on certain criteria including weighted average interest rate  remaining term and fico credit score 
the expected cash flows were discounted using treasury rates and a spread above the treasury rate was applied based on recent sales of similar assets 
the assumptions represented management s best estimates  but these estimates involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded unrealized gain in the first quarter of could have been materially different from that reflected in these financial statements 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp as a result of our fair value measurement election for the auto loan portfolio  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of million  net of tax  as a reduction of retained earnings as of january  in addition  thousand and thousand of pre tax net gains were recorded in our second and first quarter earnings  respectively cents and cents per diluted share  respectively  on an after tax basis  representing the change in fair value of such instruments during those periods after giving effect to the cumulative effect adjustment 
we have established and documented a process for determining fair value

interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses non interest income non interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income preferred stock dividends and accretion net income available to common shareholders net income per common share basic diluted net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest expense on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is impacted by changes in general market interest rates and by changes in the amounts and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the table below indicates net interest income  net interest margin  and net interest rate spread for each period presented 
net interest margin is expressed as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest earning assets and the average rate incurred on total interest bearing liabilities 
both of these measures are reported on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest margin is higher than net interest rate spread because net interest margin reflects interest income earned on assets funded with non interest bearing sources of funds  which include demand deposits and stockholders equity 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
we manage interest rate risk exposure with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on the net interest margin 
table  distribution of average statements of condition and analysis of net interest income  compares interest income and average interest earning assets with interest expense and average interest bearing liabilities for the three years  and the table also indicates net interest income  net interest margin and net interest rate spread for each period presented

page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp the net interest rate spread in reflects a decline of basis points over in the yield on interest earning assets and a dramatic decline of basis points in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  reflecting a sharply declining interest rate environment in in contrast  the yield on interest earning assets increased basis points in over while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points 
the tax equivalent net interest margin increased to in  up basis points from  and declined basis points to in from in  the effects of lower rates on deposits and borrowings due to sharply declining market rates outweighed the effects of lower loan yields and an increased level of borrowings to support loan growth 
in  the margin was impacted by a higher cost of funds in a rising interest rate environment as well as competition for deposits  partially offset by higher loan yields and a decrease in borrowings 
in addition  the composition of average interest earning assets shifted in both and over the prior year as described below  affecting the tax equivalent net interest margin in both years 
the overall earnings on assets are affected by loan rates and the mix of interest earning assets 
the composition of interest earning assets in over reflects a shift to higher yielding loans from federal funds sold while over reflects the opposite  a shift to federal funds sold from loans 
the movement follows the sale of the indirect auto portfolio in the second quarter of when the proceeds of million were initially invested in federal funds sold and gradually reinvested in higher yielding relationship loans 
average interest earning assets increased million  or  in compared to and million  or  in compared to the increase in primarily relates to loan growth of million  partially offset by a million decline in federal funds sold  while the increase in primarily reflects an increase in federal funds sold as a result of the indirect auto loan sale noted above 
the average yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points in compared to and increased basis points in over reflecting very different market conditions 
in most categories of interest earning assets recorded declines in yields  reflecting a sharply declining rate environment  with the exception of municipal bonds for which state and political subdivisions were forced to offer higher rates as investors became wary of the insurance companies which guaranteed the instruments 
in addition  the perceived credit risk of municipalities in general increased 
the increase in yields in most categories of interest earning assets in over is primarily attributable to the increasing interest rate environment through august of the yield on municipal securities declined in due to maturities of higher yielding bonds in our portfolio and replacement of bonds at lower yields 
the yield on the loan portfolio  which comprised  and of average earning assets in and and  respectively  decreased basis points in from and increased basis points in over the decrease in loan yields reflects the downward repricing of variable rate loans and new loans originated at lower market rates  as well as maturities and pay downs of higher yielding loans  partially offset by higher yields on fixed rate loans originated before the market decline 
although non accrual loans were million at december  compared to thousand at december   the impact of forgone interest on the yield on loans in was only basis points 
the increase in in the loan yield reflects loan originations at higher yields  the paydown of loans at lower yields and the write down to fair value and subsequent sale of the lower yielding indirect auto portfolio 
the overall cost of liabilities is affected by offered rates and the mix of deposits and other liabilities 
the overall rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points in over  and increased basis points in over  responding to federal fund target rate movements in both years 
market rates are in part based on the federal reserve open market committee fomc target federal funds interest rate the interest rate banks charge each other for short term borrowings 
the change in the federal funds sold and purchased rates is the result of target rate changes implemented by the fomc 
in  there were seven downward adjustments to the target rate totaling basis points  bringing the target interest rate to a historic low with a range of to 
in  beginning in august  there were three downward adjustments totaling basis points bringing the target interest rate down to by december  the rate on purchased funds declined dramatically by basis points in over  primarily due to declines in the federal funds target rate 
the rate on subordinated debt declined basis points reflecting a decline in three month libor  to which the borrowing rate is indexed 
in over  the rate on purchased funds increased basis points reflecting the change in the federal funds target rate 
the rate on subordinated debt increased basis points reflecting an increase in three month libor  to which the borrowing is indexed 
in  the average rate on savings and money market accounts  which comprise approximately of interest bearing liabilities  decreased basis points and the rate on time deposits decreased basis points  reflecting lower offered rates on deposits in response to lower market rates 
the rate on interest bearing transaction accounts remained relatively unchanged 
in  the rate on savings and money market accounts increased basis points over and the rate on time deposits increased basis points reflecting the rising federal fund target rate 
the rate on interest bearing transaction accounts remained unchanged from the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in compared to  and million  or  in compared to in over  deposit increases were recorded in most deposit categories 
notably  the increase in average savings and money market accounts of million was mainly due to a new on balance sheet cash sweep program as discussed in the deposits section below 
a new cdars product contributed to an increase in average reciprocal time deposits of million 
the increase in interest bearing liabilities in was also the result of an increase in average purchased funds of million as our loan growth outpaced the deposit growth 
total average interest bearing deposits increased million in  which reflected higher average savings and money markets accounts  due to higher offered rates in response to the rising federal funds target rate at that time and competitive pricing  partially offset by declines of million in average time deposits and million in average purchased funds  reflecting the lessened need for borrowing following the sale of the indirect auto portfolio 
see table  distribution of average deposits and section on deposits for further detail and discussion of the shift in the relative mix of deposits during and table  analysis of changes in net interest income  separates the change in net interest income into two components volume change caused by increases or decreases in the average asset and liability balances outstanding  and yield rate changes in average yields on earning assets and average rates for interest bearing liabilities 
table shows the impact on income of balance sheet changes and the changes in market interest rate levels which occurred during and page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp the table indicates that in  the decreases in both interest income and interest expense were heavily impacted by decreases in rate  partially offset by increases related to volume  while in the increase in interest income was fairly evenly impacted by rate and volume  while the increase in interest expense was more impacted by rate than volume

the unallocated change in rate or volume variance has been allocated between the rate and volume variances on a pro rata basis 
provision for loan losses management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis based on several factors including growth of the loan portfolio  analysis of probable losses in the portfolio  recent loss experience and the current economic climate 
actual losses on loans are charged against the allowance  and the allowance is increased through the provision for loan losses charged to expense 
for further discussion  see the section captioned critical accounting policies 
our provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to thousand in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans totaled at december   compared to at december  the increase to the provision and allowance for loan losses in reflected the significant level of loan growth that we experienced in  and an increased allocation for economic uncertainty 
the us economy is experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system  dramatic declines in the housing market  and an increasing unemployment rate 
during the second half of  there has been unprecedented volatility and deterioration in the financial markets  the failure of well known companies and the start of a national recession 
we have begun to see financial difficulties experienced by borrowers  especially in the construction industry  where sale prices have declined and holding periods have increased 
consequently  we have increased the economic factor from at december  to at december   resulting in an increase in the allowance for loan losses related to economic uncertainty of million in the specific reserve increased from zero at december  to thousand at december  net charge offs in totaling million primarily relate to construction loans secured by real property where the value of collateral has declined 
net charge offs in totaled thousand

in  the mandatory redemption of a portion of our shares of visa  inc generated a net gain of thousand 
excluding these nonrecurring gains  non interest income in increased thousand or from  and increased thousand or in over the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in was primarily attributable to an increase in fees from our business analysis accounts  primarily reflecting a reduced earnings credit  as well as an increase in fees on checks drawn against insufficient funds effective april   combined with higher volume 
the increase in service charges in was due to the same reasons 
the increase in wms income in reflected new assets under management and one time estate settlement fees  partially offset by market declines affecting fees 
the increase in wms income was primarily the result of growth in assets under management and market appreciation of assets 
the decrease in the other non interest income in was primarily due to a thousand decrease in reverse mortgage fees we terminated this service on may   an thousand decrease in net remote deposit capture fees which are offset by earnings credit through business analysis  a thousand decrease in visa fees following the sale of the visa credit card portfolio in the third quarter of  and a thousand decrease in cash manager fees when customers switched to a new on balance sheet sweep product  we no longer receive significant fees from the previous cash management reserve processor 
the decreases were partially offset by higher miscellaneous income due to thousand of interest we received in the second quarter of on amended tax returns and a thousand increase in bank owned life insurance boli income due to million new purchase of policies in the increase in other income in primarily resulted from an increase in boli due to the additional investment of million in september and a gradually increasing yield  and higher miscellaneous income which included thousand of indirect auto loan recoveries subsequent to recording these loans at their fair value

the increases in salaries and benefits costs from to were due to normal inflation adjusted annual salary increases  partially offset by a slight decrease in net fte employees from at year end the increases in occupancy and equipment expenses in compared to were primarily related to higher premises rent associated with the new mill valley branch opened in june  as well as higher maintenance and repair costs 
the increases in in occupancy and equipment costs of thousand were largely due to a full year s expense related to the lease of our new corporate office  the addition of a new san francisco loan office lease  and annual rent increases in the branch facilities 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in was primarily due to the addition of leasehold improvements associated with the remodeling of the san rafael branch in the second quarter of  and the addition of the mill valley branch during june the increase in depreciation and amortization in reflected expenses associated with the remodeling of our northgate branch  a full year of amortization of the new corporate office  as well as expenses associated with the opening of the new loan office in san francisco

the increases in data processing costs in over were due to the contractually stipulated price increases that are part of our long term agreement with our data processing provider and also due to costs associated with regulatory compliance and the implementation of new products and services 
the decrease in professional services in over was largely attributable to a decrease in expenses associated with the holding company formation in and the discontinuation of a consulting agreement that began in july of and ended in june of the increase in professional services in from reflected higher legal and accounting expenses  primarily associated with the formation of the holding company as well as a full year of the consulting agreement that commenced in july of the increases in other non interest expense in over reflected increases in fdic insurance due to an increase in industry wide fdic assessment and growth in our deposit level  other processing costs  advertising  and investor relations expenses 
fdic insurance in could be more than five times that of if a recently proposed one time assessment of basis points on covered deposits becomes final on top of already enacted assessment increases 
in november  we elected to provide unlimited insurance coverage on non interest bearing transaction accounts  on which we will pay a basis point surcharge per covered balances in excess of thousand 
in addition  the fdic insurance assessment on transaction accounts under thousand will increase from basis points to basis points annually per covered in the first quarter of  related to a uniform increased assessment 
beginning april   the base rate of banks in the best risk category will range from twelve to sixteen cents per of covered deposits 
finally  as discussed above  on february   the fdic proposed a one time assessment of basis points on covered deposits as of june   payable on september  the newly issued proposal also gives the fdic the ability to impose future emergency special assessments of up to basis points if necessary 
in  other non interest expense includes a pre tax non recurring charge of thousand recorded in the fourth quarter for the potential obligation to visa usa in connection with certain litigation indemnifications provided to visa usa by visa member banks 
the increase in other non interest expense in over also includes increases in fdic insurance and information technology costs  partially offset by decreases in other losses  director expenses  and advertising 
provision for income taxes we reported a provision for income taxes of million  million  and million for the years   and respectively 
the effective tax rates were  and for those same periods 
these provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and california franchise tax based upon reported pre tax income  and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes such as earnings on qualified municipal securities  boli and certain tax exempt loans 
therefore  there are normal fluctuations in the effective rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax 
we have not been subject to an alternative minimum tax amt 
bancorp and the bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement which provides that income taxes shall be allocated between the parties on a separate entity basis 
the intent of this agreement is that each member of the consolidated group will incur no greater tax liability than it would have incurred on a stand alone basis

we have historically targeted well established local businesses with strong guarantors that have proven to be resilient in periods of economic stress 
as such  demand in that area did not appear to be significantly impacted by the recent turmoil in the financial markets 
commercial real estate loans increased million in the same period  mainly driven by increased demand from existing customers 
construction loans increased million in due to both the acquisition of new projects as well as the funding of commitments carried over from the prior year 
residential real estate loans increased million 
a large part of the residential real estate loan opportunities were for the conversion of acquisition and development loans to tenant in common units in san francisco  a trend that will continue through further  we had a consumer loan promotion in  which resulted in significant growth in revolving home equity loans within our primary market area 
commercial loans increased by million in compared to  and real estate loans increased by million in the same period 
the increase in commercial loan totals resulted from a targeted emphasis on commercial and industrial lending  specifically asset based lines of credit  as well as the opening of the san francisco loan production office 
commercial real estate loans increased due to ongoing demand complemented by opportunities that surfaced as a result of our active involvement in our trade area 
residential real estate loans increased million from to  reflecting the same trend discussed above

as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio through a provision for probable loan losses charged against earnings 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
the balance of our allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of the remaining losses inherent in the portfolio 
the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including the real estate market  changes in interest rate and economic and political environments 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans at december  was versus at the end of and at the end of based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio  management believes that the million allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio

 the indirect auto loan portfolio was recorded at fair value in as a result  an unrealized loss of million was recorded as a reduction of loans  and the allowance for loan losses was reduced by million  which is reflected in the table below

the first component  the specific allowance  results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral  as applicable 
through management s ongoing loan grading process  individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms 
these loans are evaluated individually by management based on sfas no 
and specified allowances for loan losses are established where applicable 
the second component  the allowance factor  is an estimate of the probable inherent losses across the major loan categories in our loan portfolio 
this analysis is based on loan grades by pool and current general economic and business conditions determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
this analysis covers our entire loan portfolio but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above 
the total amount allocated for this component is determined by applying loss estimation factors to outstanding loans 
there are limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan every quarter 
therefore  it is possible that in the future some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
the third component of the allowance for credit losses is an economic component that is not allocated to specific loans or groups of loans  but rather is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  and economic trends 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million consisting of a specific allowance of thousand  an allowance based on sfas no 
for categories of credits of million  and an economic allowance of million 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million consisting of a specific allowance of zero  an allowance based on sfas no 
for categories of credits of million  and an economic allowance of million 
during  the reserves allocated to commercial  construction and real estate loans increased compared to  primarily due to increases in general valuation allowances related to growth in the loan portfolio in these categories 
in addition  we increased the allowance factor for construction loans in  recognizing an increased risk in these loans  reflecting the softening of the construction industry  especially in sonoma county

boli totaled million at december   compared to million at december   and is recorded in other assets 
other assets also include net deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these deferred tax assets consist primarily of tax benefits expected to be realized in future periods related to temporary differences of allowance for loan losses  depreciation  net unrealized loss on securities available for sale  stock based compensation and deferred compensation 
management believes these assets to be realizable due to our consistent record of earnings and the expectation that earnings will continue at a level adequate to realize such benefits 
in addition  we held million and million of fhlb stock recorded at cost in other assets at december  and  respectively 
in january  fhlb notified us that they temporarily suspended dividend payments on stock in order to build up higher retained earnings and to preserve their capital 
management does not believe that the temporary suspension of dividends on fhlb stock resulted in other than temporary impairment on our investment in fhlb stock as we expect to be able to redeem this stock at cost 
deposits deposits  which are used to fund our interest earning assets  increased million in excluding a million short term deposit placed with the bank in december  which was withdrawn in january  deposits grew million 
the growth in deposits was positively impacted by our introduction of an on balance sheet sweep account program in june of the previous program swept customer balances over an agreed amount to a vendor who invested the funds outside the bank 
the current program provides for these funds to remain at the bank as part of money market deposits 
this allowed million of customer deposits  which previously would have been swept off the balance sheet  to remain on the balance sheet at december  further  in march  we introduced a new deposit product  certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
cdars is a network through which the bank offers full fdic insurance coverage in excess of the regulatory maximum by placing deposits in multiple banks participating in the network 
cdars reciprocal deposits totaled million at december  lastly  recent failures in certain banks led to increased customer concern over deposit safety 
we believe that we have successfully attracted new money due to our financial soundness and our legacy of customer service 
the opening of our new mill valley branch in june also generated million in deposits in the economic downturn in also appears to have a general impact on our customers  many of which are holding lower balances 
in  we experienced a slight decline in savings accounts 
no individual customer accounted for more than of deposits 
we have experienced a slight shift in the relative mix of interest bearing deposits in compared to as the proportion of higher costing time accounts and money market deposit accounts has increased while the proportion of savings and demand deposits have decreased slightly 
the shift in relative proportions is mainly related to the two new products discussed above

deferred compensation obligations we maintain a nonqualified  unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key management personnel 
under this plan  participating employees may defer compensation  which will entitle them to receive certain payments upon retirement  death  or disability 
the plan provides for payments for up to fifteen years commencing upon retirement and reduced benefits upon early retirement  disability  or termination of employment 
the participating employee may elect to receive payments over periods not to exceed fifteen years

as permitted or required under california law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law  we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
these indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in  or not opposed to  the best interests of the corporation  and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal 
capital adequacy as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the bank s capital ratios are above regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized and bancorp s ratios exceed the required minimum ratios for capital adequacy purposes 
the bank s total risk based capital ratio increased from at december   to at december   and bancorp s total risk based capital ratio increased from at december   to at december  the increases in the risk based capital ratio are due primarily to a million injection in capital we received through tcpp  which qualifies as tier capital 
our capital ratios will be reduced if we repurchase the preferred stock from the us treasury 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in october  we received approval from the california department of financial institutions dfi and the fdic to buy back up to  or approximately  of the bank s  then outstanding shares  not to exceed million 
the repurchase program allowed us to purchase common shares for a period of approximately twelve months from the approval date in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
in we repurchased  shares at prices ranging from to for a total cost of million 
in through february  we purchased an additional  shares at prices ranging from to for a total cost of million  thereby concluding this share repurchase program 
in november our board of directors approved an additional plan to repurchase common shares of bancorp up to million 
no regulatory approval was required for this repurchase plan as we were exempt under the provisions of regulation y of the federal reserve board 
in november and december  we repurchased a total of  shares at an average price of for a total cost of million 
during the first nine months of  we repurchased  shares at an average price of  plus commissions  for a total cost of million 
in september  the repurchase plan was discontinued to preserve capital during a time of extreme economic turbulence

liquidity the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet both loan demand and unexpected deposit withdrawals 
we accomplish this goal by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid assets  and formal lines of credit with the fhlb and frb of san francisco and correspondent banks that enable us to borrow funds as needed 
our asset liability management committee alco  which is comprised of certain directors of the bank  is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
alco has developed a contingency plan should liquidity drop unexpectedly below internal requirements 
we obtain funds from the repayment and maturity of loans as well as deposit inflows  investment security maturities and paydowns  federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
our primary uses of funds are the origination of loans  the purchase of investment securities  withdrawals of deposits  maturity of certificate of deposits  repayment of borrowings and dividends to common and preferred stockholders 
we must retain and attract new deposits  which depends upon the variety and effectiveness of our customer account products  service and convenience  and rates paid to customers  as well as our financial strength 
any long term decline in retail deposit funding would adversely impact our liquidity 
management anticipates that federal funds purchased and fhlb advances will continue to be important sources of funding in the future  and we expect to post adequate collateral for such funding requirements 
a decline in bancorp s or the bank s credit worthiness would adversely affect our ability to borrow and or the related borrowing costs  thus impacting our liquidity 
as presented in the accompanying audited consolidated statements of cash flows  the sources of liquidity vary between periods 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million 
the primary sources of funds during were million in federal funds purchased and fhlb borrowings  million in the maturities and paydowns of securities available for sale  million net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and the related warrants to the us treasury  million from the proceeds of sale of securities  million net cash provided by operating activities and million increase in deposits 
the primary uses of funds were million in loan originations net of principal collections  and million investment securities purchases 
the sources and uses differ from because the proceeds from the sale of our indirect auto portfolio of million enhanced our liquidity in we anticipate that we will be in a borrowing position in if we are unable to attract deposits in this time of economic uncertainty and competition for deposits in the marketplace intensifies  our reliance on borrowings will increase 
in addition  if we repurchase our preferred stock from the us treasury  we may fund the repurchase through additional borrowings  thus negatively impacting our liquidity 
we will monitor our lending activity to ensure our liquidity position is not jeopardized 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and unpledged securities maturing within one year totaled million 
the remainder of the unpledged available for sale securities portfolio of million provides additional liquidity 
taken together  these liquid assets equaled of our assets at december   compared to at december  the decreased liquidity in was primarily due to loan growth exceeding deposit growth 
since our receipt of the us treasury s million tcpp funds on december   we have increased net loans by million through year end 
we anticipate that cash and cash equivalents on hand and our sources of funds will provide adequate liquidity for our operating  investing and financing needs and our regulatory liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
management monitors our liquidity position daily  balancing loan funding payments with changes in deposit activity and overnight investments 
our emphasis on local deposits combined with our equity to assets ratio  provides a very stable funding base 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we have substantial additional borrowing capacity including unsecured lines of credit totaling million with correspondent banks and a million line of credit with the frb to borrow overnight  which were not drawn upon at december  the bank is a member of the fhlb and has a line of credit secured under terms of a blanket collateral agreement by a pledge of certain assets for advances of million  of which million was available at december   at an interest rate determined daily 
the overnight borrowing rate generally approximates the federal funds target rate  however due to market volatility  the rate ranged from to in borrowings under the line of credit are limited to eligible collateral 
the contract amount of loan commitments not reflected on the consolidated statement of condition was million at december  at rates ranging from to 
this amount included million under commercial lines of credit these commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards  million under revolving home equity lines  million under undisbursed construction loans  million under standby letters of credit  and a remaining million under personal and other lines of credit 
these commitments  to the extent used  are expected to be funded through repayment of existing loans  deposit growth and fhlb borrowings 
over the next twelve months  million of time deposits will mature 
we expect these funds to be replaced with new time  money market or savings accounts

the primary uses of funds are stockholder dividends  investment in our bank subsidiary  stock repurchases prior to the discontinuation of the stock repurchase program in september and ordinary operating expenses 
we anticipate that there will be sufficient earnings at the bank level to provide dividends to bancorp to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the risk is inherent in our deposit and lending activities 
management  together with alco  has sought to manage rate sensitivity and maturities of assets and liabilities to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
additionally  interest rate risk exposure is managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on our net interest margin 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
interest rate risk exposure is managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on the net interest margin 
activities in asset and liability management include  but are not limited to  lending  borrowing  accepting deposits and investing in securities 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset and liability management 
sensitivity of net interest income nii and capital to interest rate changes results from differences in the maturity or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the consolidated statement of condition is managed with the objective of correlating the movements of interest rates on loans and investments with those of deposits and borrowings 
the asset and liability policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of change to nii and capital in changing interest rate environments 
we use simulation models to forecast nii and capital 
exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by the alco and the board of directors 
they utilize interest rate sensitivity simulation models as a tool for achieving these objectives and for developing ways in which to improve profitability 
a simplified statement of condition is prepared on a quarterly basis as a starting point  using as inputs  actual loans  investments  borrowings and deposits 
if potential changes to net equity value and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest changes are not within the limits established by the board of directors  management may adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within approved limits 
in the following simulation of nii and capital under various interest rate scenarios  the simplified statement of condition is processed against three interest rate change scenarios 
in addition to a flat rate scenario  which assumes interest rates are unchanged  the scenarios include three basis point increases 
as the federal funds target rate at december  was already at its historic low of  there cannot be further reductions in the target rate 
therefore  a reduction in rate scenario is not considered in the following table at december  each of these scenarios assumes that the change in interest rates is immediate and interest rates remain at the new levels 
table summarizes the effect on nii and capital due to changing interest rates as measured against the flat rate scenario 
table effect of interest rate change on net interest income and capital at december  changes in interest estimated change in nii estimated change in capital rates in basis points as percent of nii as percent of capital up up up unchanged page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp the above table estimates the impact of interest rate changes 
the estimated changes are within our policy guidelines established by alco 
the table indicates that at december   we were asset sensitive in a rising interest rate environment 
we have mitigated the earnings sensitivity somewhat through the procurement of fixed rate borrowings 
as with any simulation model or other method of measuring interest rate risk  certain limitations are inherent in the process 
for example  although certain of our assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing time frames  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the changes in interest rates on certain categories of either our assets or liabilities may precede or lag changes in market interest rates 
also  the actual rates and timing of prepayments on loans and investment securities could vary significantly from the assumptions used in the various scenarios 
further  changes in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the yield curve could produce different results from those presented in the table 
accordingly  the results presented should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
one aspect is the time frame within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates at repricing or maturity 
an analysis of the repricing time frames is called a gap analysis because it shows the gap between the amounts of assets and liabilities repricing in each of several periods of time 
another aspect is the relative magnitude of the repricing for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability given various changes in market rates 
gap analysis gives no indication of the relative magnitude of repricing 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of change in market rates 
interest rate sensitivity gaps are calculated as the difference between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing during various time periods 
table shows our repricing gaps as of december  due to the limitations of gap analysis  as described above  we do not generally use it in managing interest rate risk 
instead we rely on the more sophisticated simulation model described above as its primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk
