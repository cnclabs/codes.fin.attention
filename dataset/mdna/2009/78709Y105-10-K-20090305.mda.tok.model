the key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our network as measured by our average daily shipments and tonnage  the prices we obtain for our services as measured by revenue per hundredweight a measure of yield and revenue per shipment  our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits  purchased transportation  claims and insurance expense  fuel and maintenance  and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels 
fuel surcharges have remained in effect for several years and are a significant component of revenue and pricing

outlook our business remains highly correlated to the success of company specific improvement initiatives as well as a variety of external factors including the general economy 
given the significantly decreased volumes and increasingly competitive pricing trends in and early there remains considerable uncertainty as to the direction of the economy for  including the timing of any economic recovery

critical accounting policies and estimates saia makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein 
in the opinion of management  the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of saia include claims and insurance accruals 
the company has self insured retention limits generally ranging from  to  per claim for medical  workers compensation  auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
for only the policy year march through february  the company has an aggregate exposure limited to an additional  above its  per claim deductible under its auto liability program 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by the company are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of the company differ from these assumptions 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis for shipments in transit while expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectibility 
revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up  scheduled day of delivery and current trend in average rates charged to customers 
since the cycle for pick up and delivery of shipments is generally days  typically less than percent of a total month s revenue is in transit at the end of any month 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses  adjustments processed and trends of collections 
billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated  however  changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates 
depreciation and capitalization of assets 
under the company s accounting policy for property and equipment  management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for the company s revenue equipment tractors and trailers based on their estimated useful lives and estimated fair values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in 
these estimates are routinely evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant 
however  actual depreciation and salvage values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
recovery of goodwill 
in connection with its acquisition of clark bros 
in  the connection in and madison freight in  the company allocated purchase price based on independent appraisals of intangible assets and real property and management s estimates of valuations of other tangible assets 
annually  the company assesses goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
this fair value based test involves assumptions regarding the long term future performance of the company  fair value of 
table of contents the assets and liabilities of the company  cost of capital rates and other assumptions 
however  actual recovery of remaining goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in this form k for discussion of a non cash goodwill impairment charge 
equity based incentive compensation 
the company maintains long term incentive compensation arrangements in the form of stock options  cash based awards and stock based awards 
the criteria for the cash based and stock based awards are total shareholder return versus a peer group of companies over a three year performance period 
the company accrues for cash based award expenses based on performance criteria from the beginning of the performance period through the reporting date 
this results in the potential for significant adjustments from period to period that cannot be predicted 
the company accounts for stock based awards in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
r with the expense amortized over the three year vesting period based on the fair value using the monte carlo method at the date the stock based awards are granted 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
r with option expense amortized over the three year vesting period based on the black scholes merton fair value at the date the options are granted 
see discussion of adoption of statement no 
r in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
these accounting policies  and others  are described in further detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk saia is exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of interest rates and fuel prices 
the detail of saia s debt structure is more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
to mitigate our risk to rising fuel prices  saia motor freight has implemented fuel surcharge programs 
these programs are well established within the industry and customer acceptance of fuel surcharges remains high 
since the amount of fuel surcharge is based on average national diesel fuel prices and is reset weekly  exposure of saia to fuel price volatility is significantly reduced 
the following table provides information about saia third party financial instruments as of december  with comparative information for december  the table presents principal cash flows in millions and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates
