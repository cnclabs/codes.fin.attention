item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by current conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally negative developments in the latter half of and in the banking industry have resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets in general and a related general economic downturn  which have continued into in addition  as a consequence of the recession that the united states now finds itself in  business activity across a broad range of industries faces significant difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and liquidity concerns in the global credit markets 
at the same time we have seen unemployment increase significantly 

table of contents part i continued item a continued as a result of the current economic environment  many financial institutions  including us  have experienced declines in the performance of their loans  including construction  land development and land loans  commercial loans and consumer loans 
consequently  competition among financial institutions for quality loans and deposits has increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many real estate dependent loans have declined and may continue to decline 
financial stock prices have been negatively affected  as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets has become more difficult compared to recent years 
as a result  there is potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations 
the impact of the recession extending for a lengthy time may adversely impact our financial performance and our stock price 
in addition  further negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provision for possible loan losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely magnify the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and many others in the banking industry 
overall  during the past year  the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business  and there can be no assurance that the environment will improve anytime soon 
until conditions improve  we expect our business  financial condition and results of operations to be negatively impacted 
rapidly changing interest rate environments could reduce our net interest margin  net interest income  fee income and net income interest and fees on loans and securities  net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings  are a large part of our net income 
interest rates are key drivers of our net interest margin and subject to many factors beyond the control of management 
as interest rates change  net interest income is affected 
rapid increases in interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in financial instrument maturities 
further  substantially higher interest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth particularly in construction lending  an important factor in the company s revenue growth over the years 
decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities and  therefore  decrease net interest income 
in response to the dramatic deterioration of the subprime  mortgage  credit and liquidity markets  the federal reserve reduced interest rates by a total of basis points since december  which likely will reduce our net interest income during the first quarter of and the foreseeable future 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere for further discussion of interest rate market risk 

table of contents part i continued item a continued our business is subject to the success of the local economies where we operate our success significantly depends upon the growth in population  income levels  deposits and housing starts in our primary and secondary markets 
if the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable  our business may not succeed 
we are currently experiencing adverse economic conditions in some of our market areas  which affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us and generally negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the market value of the real estate securing our loans as collateral has been adversely affected by the slowing economy and unfavorable change in economic conditions in our market areas and could be further adversely affected in the future 
as of december   approximately percent of our loans receivable were secured by real estate 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses caused by the adverse market and economic conditions  including the downturn in the real estate market in the state of georgia will adversely affect the value of our assets  our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
currently  we are experiencing such an economic downturn  and if it continues  our operations could be further adversely affected 
we make and hold in our portfolio a significant number of land acquisition and development and construction loans  which in the current market environment pose more credit risk than other types of loans typically made by financial institutions we offer land acquisition and development and construction loans for builders and developers 
as of december   approximately million of our loan portfolio represents loans for which the related property is neither presold nor preleased 
these land acquisition and development and construction loans are considered more risky than other types of residential mortgage loans 
the primary credit risks associated with land acquisition and development and construction lending are underwriting  project risks and market risks 
project risks include cost overruns  borrower credit risk  project completion risk  general contractor credit risk and environmental and other hazard risks 
market risks are risks associated with the sale of the completed residential units 
they include affordability risk  which means the risk of affordability of financing by borrowers  product design risks  and risks posed by completing projects 
while we believe we have established adequate reserves on our financial statements to cover the credit risk of our land acquisition and development and construction loan portfolio  there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed our reserves  which could adversely impact our earnings 
current and anticipated deterioration in the housing market and the homebuilding industry may lead to increased loss severities and further worsening of delinquencies and nonperforming assets in our loan portfolios 
consequently  our results of operations may be adversely impacted there has been substantial industry concern and publicity over asset quality among financial institutions due in large part to issues related to subprime mortgage lending  declining real estate values and general economic concerns 
furthermore  the housing and the residential mortgage markets recently have experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate  they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on our loan portfolios and real estate owned as we continue to reassess the market value of our loan portfolio  the losses associated with the loans in default and the net realizable value of real estate owned 

table of contents part i continued item a continued the homebuilding industry has experienced a significant and sustained decline in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale in various markets  including some of the markets in which we lend 
our customers who are builders and developers face greater difficulty in selling their homes in markets where these trends are more pronounced 
consequently  we are facing increased delinquencies and nonperforming assets as these builders and developers are forced to default on their loans with us 
we do not anticipate that the housing market will improve in the near term and  accordingly  additional downgrades  provisions for loan losses and charge offs related to our loan portfolio may occur 
liquidity risk could impact our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition liquidity is essential for our business 
an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowings or the sale of securities or loans could have a significant negative impact on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
we rely on commercial and retail deposits  brokered deposits  advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of atlanta and other borrowings to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if  among other things  our results of operations or financial condition or the results of operations or financial condition of the fhlb of atlanta or market conditions were to change 
although we consider these sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs  there can be no assurance in this regard and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future 
likewise  we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our business strategies  in connection with future acquisitions or for other reasons 
there can be no assurance additional borrowings  if sought  would be available to us or  if available  would be on favorable terms 
financial stock prices have been negatively affected by the recent adverse economic environment  as has the ability of the financial services industry to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
we actively review the depository institutions that hold our federal funds sold and due from banks cash balances 
we are currently not able to provide assurances that access to our cash equivalents and federal funds sold will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and we diversify our due from banks and federal funds sold among correspondent banks to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
the financials of the correspondent banks are reviewed routinely as part of our asset liability management process 
balances in our accounts with financial institutions in the u 
s 
may exceed the fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if the financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 

table of contents part i continued item a continued concern of customers over deposit insurance may cause a decrease in deposits with recent increased concerns about bank failures  customers increasingly are concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by fdic 
customers may withdraw deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with their bank is fully insured 
decreases in deposits may adversely affect our funding costs and net income 
colony began offering cdars product during that provides customers the opportunity to place uninsured deposits into the cdars network and receive full fdic insurance coverage and with the reciprocal agreement a like amount of funds is placed back in our bank  though these reciprocal deposits are classified as brokered deposits 
our federal deposit insurance premium could be substantially higher in the future  which could have a material adverse effect the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including the bank 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at a certain level 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures and expectations for further failures  in which case the fdic ensures payments of deposits up to insured limits from the deposit insurance fund 
on october   the fdic published a restoration plan designed to replenish the deposit insurance fund over a period of five years and to increase the deposit insurance reserve ratio  which decreased to percent of insured deposits on june   to the statutory minimum of percent of insured deposits by december  in order to implement the restoration plan  the fdic proposes to change both its risk based assessment system and its base assessment rates 
for the first quarter of only  the fdic increased all fdic deposit assessment rates by basis points 
these new rates range from basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions 
under the fdic s restoration plan  the fdic proposes to establish new initial base assessment rates that will be subject to adjustment as described below 
beginning april   the base assessment rates would range from basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions 
changes to the risk based assessment system would include increasing premiums for institutions that rely on excessive amounts of brokered deposits  cdars  increasing premiums for excessive use of secured liabilities  including federal home loan bank advances 
either an increase in the risk category of the bank or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
there can be no assurance that the recently enacted emergency economic stabilization act of and the american recovery and reinvestment act will help stabilize the us economy and financial system on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was enacted 
the us treasury and banking regulators are implementing a number of programs under this legislation and otherwise to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system  including the tarp capital purchase program cpp 
the company participated in the cpp program and received million on january  through the issuance of preferred stock along with warrants 
in addition  other regulators have taken steps to stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets  such as the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlg program  which we opted to remain in the unlimited insurance coverage for non interest bearing accounts and now accounts in which the rate of interest paid is percent or less but opted out of the debt guarantee portion of this program 

table of contents part i continued item a continued in addition  the us congress recently enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act arra in an effort to save and create jobs  stimulate the us economy and promote long term growth and stability 
there can also be no assurance as to the actual impact that the eesa  arra and other programs will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of the eesa  arra and other programs to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of the current financial markets conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
the eesa and arra are is relatively new legislation and  as such  are subject to change and evolving interpretation 
this is particularly true given the change in administration that occurred on january  there can be no assurance as to the effects that such changes will have on their in improving the us economy effectiveness or on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
treasury stress tests and other actions may adversely affect bank operations and value of shares on february   the us treasury secretary outlined a plan to restore stability to the financial system 
this announcement included reference to a plan by the treasury to conduct stress tests of banks which received funds under the capital purchase program and similar treasury programs 
the methods and procedures to be used by the treasury in conducting its stress tests  how these methods and procedures will be applied  and the significance or consequence of such tests presently are not known 
any of these or their consequences could adversely affect us  our bank operations and the value of colony shares  among other things 
slower than anticipated growth in new branches and new product and service offerings could result in reduced net income we have placed a strategic emphasis on expanding our branch network and product offerings 
executing this strategy carries risks of slower than anticipated growth both in new branches and new products 
new branches and products require a significant investment of both financial and personnel resources 
lower than expected loan and deposit growth in new investments can decrease anticipated revenues and net income generated by those investments  and opening new branches and introducing new products could result in more additional expenses than anticipated and divert resources from current core operations 
the financial services industry is very competitive we face competition in attracting and retaining deposits  making loans  and providing other financial services throughout our market area 
our competitors include other community banks  larger banking institutions  and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions  government sponsored enterprises  mutual fund companies  insurance companies and other nonbanking businesses 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than us 
for a more complete discussion of our competitive environment  see business markets and competition in item above 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we will lose market share  and income from deposits  loans and other products may be reduced 

table of contents part i continued item a continued inability to hire or retain certain key professionals  management and staff could adversely affect our revenues and net income we rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business  including major revenue generating functions such as our loan and deposit portfolios 
the loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively  which could negatively affect our revenues 
in addition  loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses  which could cause a decrease in our net income

table of contents part ii continued item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company colony bankcorp  inc colony is a bank holding company headquartered in fitzgerald  georgia that provides  through its wholly owned subsidiary collectively referred to as the company  a broad array of products and services throughout georgia markets 
the company offers commercial  consumer and mortgage banking services 
application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the company s financial position and or results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult and subjective 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  collateral values  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and historical loss experience 
the allowance for losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate  or the value of collateral for collateral dependent loans 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger nonhomogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogeneous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 

table of contents part ii continued item continued goodwill and other intangibles the company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight line and accelerated methods  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  customer attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  specific industry conditions and changes in competition 
overview the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors affecting the company s financial condition as of december  and  and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
taxable equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a percent federal tax rate  thus making tax exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields 
dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands  except for per share amounts 
results of operations the company s results of operations are determined by its ability to effectively manage interest income and expense  to minimize loan and investment losses  to generate noninterest income and to control noninterest expense 
since market forces and economic conditions beyond the control of the company determine interest rates  the ability to generate net interest income is dependent upon the company s ability to obtain an adequate spread between the rate earned on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
thus  the key performance for net interest income is the interest margin or net yield  which is taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets 
net income totaled million  or diluted per common share in compared to million  or diluted per common share in and million  or diluted per common share in 
table of contents part ii continued item continued selected income statement data  returns on average assets and average equity and dividends per share for the comparable periods were as follows taxable equivalent net interest income taxable equivalent adjustment net interest income provision for possible loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income basic per common share net income diluted per common share net income return on average assets net income return on average equity net income net income for decreased million  or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily the result of a million increase in provision for loan losses and a decrease of million in net interest income 
the impact of these items was partly offset by a million increase in noninterest income  a decrease of million in noninterest expense and a decrease of million in income tax expense 
net income for decreased million  or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily the result of a million increase in provision for loan losses and an increase of million in noninterest expense 
the impact of these items was partly offset by a million increase in net interest income  an increase of million in noninterest income and a decrease of million in income tax expense 
details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below 

table of contents part ii continued item continued net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  which are used to fund those assets 
net interest income is the company s largest source of revenue  representing percent of total revenue during and percent during net interest margin is the taxable equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets for the period 
the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin 
the federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions 
the company s loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate 
the prime interest rate  which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit has ranged from percent to percent during to at year end  the prime rate was percent and with the basis point reduction during the prime rate ended the year at percent 
the federal funds rate moved similar to prime rate with interest rates ranging from percent to percent during to at year end  the federal funds rate was percent and with the basis point reduction during the federal funds rate ended the year at percent 
we anticipate the federal reserve tightening interest rate policy toward the latter part of  which should improve colony s net interest margin 
the following table presents the changes in taxable equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities 
the changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each 
the company s consolidated average balance sheets along with an analysis of taxable equivalent net interest earnings are presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents part ii continued item continued rate volume analysis the rate volume analysis presented hereafter illustrates the change from year to year for each component of the taxable equivalent net interest income separated into the amount generated through volume changes and the amount generated by changes in the yields rates 
changes from to a changes from to a in thousands volume rate total volume rate total interest income loans  net taxable investment securities taxable tax exempt total investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks federal funds sold other interest earning assets total interest income interest expense interest bearing demand and savings deposits time deposits total interest expense on deposits other interest bearing liabilities federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements subordinated debentures other debt total interest expense net interest income loss a changes in net interest income for the periods  based on either changes in average balances or changes in average rates for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  are shown on this table 
during each year there are numerous and simultaneous balance and rate changes  therefore  it is not possible to precisely allocate the changes between balances and rates 
for the purpose of this table  changes that are not exclusively due to balance changes or rate changes have been attributed to rates 

table of contents part ii continued item continued our financial performance is impacted by  among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
we do not utilize derivatives to mitigate our credit risk  relying instead on an extensive loan review process and our allowance for loan losses 
interest rate risk is the change in value due to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of its investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company does not engage in any hedging activity or utilize any derivatives 
the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other market risks 
interest rate risk is addressed by our asset liability management committee alco which includes senior management representatives 
the alco monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact to the net portfolio of equity value and net interest income from potential changes to interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of financial institutions 
the repricing of interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is gap management and our company has established its policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
our exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by our board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine our change in net portfolio value in the event of assumed changes in interest rates 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we have implemented strategies to more closely match our balance sheet composition 
the company has engaged ftn financial to run a quarterly asset liability model for interest rate risk analysis 
we are generally focusing our investment activities on securities with terms or average lives in the year range 
the company maintains about percent of its loan portfolio in adjustable rate loans that reprice with prime rate changes  while the bulk of its other loans mature within years 
the liabilities to fund assets are primarily in short term certificates of deposit that mature within one year 
this balance sheet composition has allowed the company to be relatively constant with its net interest margin until during interest rates increased basis points and during interest rates decreased basis points 
the basis point decrease by the federal reserve in followed by basis point decrease in resulted in significant pressure in net interest margins 
net interest margin decreased to percent for compared to percent for and percent for given the federal reserve s aggressive posture during that ended the year with a range of percent federal funds target rate  we anticipate a slightly improved net interest margin in 
table of contents part ii continued item continued taxable equivalent net interest income for decreased million  or percent  compared to  while taxable equivalent net interest income for increased by million  or percent  compared to the fluctuation between the comparable periods resulted from the slight positive impact of growth in the average volume of earning assets and a negative impact from the decreasing average interest rates 
the average volume of earning assets during increased almost million compared to while over the same period the net interest margin decreased to percent from percent 
similarly  the average volume of earning assets during increased million compared to while over the same period the net interest margin decreased to percent from percent 
growth in average earning assets during and was primarily in loans 
the reduction in the net interest margin in was primarily the result of the federal reserve reducing interest rates basis points during along with sluggish loan growth in the average volume of loans increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the average yield on loans decreased basis points in compared to and increased basis points in compared to funding for this growth was primarily provided by other borrowings in and by deposit growth in the average volume of other borrowings increased million in compared to while average deposits decreased million in compared to the average volume of deposits increased million in compared to interest bearing deposits made up percent of the decrease in average deposits in and percent of the growth in average deposits in accordingly  the ratio of average interest bearing deposits to total average deposits was percent in  percent in and percent in this deposit mix  combined with a general decrease in interest rates  had the effect of i decreasing the average cost of total deposits by basis points in compared to and increasing the average cost of total deposits by basis points in compared to  and ii mitigating a portion of the impact of decreasing yields on earning assets on the company s net interest income 
the company s net interest spread  which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was percent in compared to percent in and percent in the net interest spread  as well as the net interest margin  will be impacted by future changes in short term and long term interest rate levels  as well as the impact from the competitive environment 
a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about interest rate sensitivity included elsewhere in this report 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for possible loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which  in management s best estimate  is necessary to absorb probable losses within the existing loan portfolio 
the provision for possible loan losses totaled million in compared to million in and million in see the section captioned allowance for possible loan losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for possible loan losses 

table of contents part ii continued item continued noninterest income the components of noninterest income were as follows service charges on deposit accounts other charges  commissions and fees other mortgage fee income securities gains total noninterest income for increased million  or percent  compared to while total noninterest income for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase in noninterest income compared to was primarily in securities gains and other income  while the increase in noninterest income compared to was primarily in mortgage fee income and service charges on deposit accounts 
changes in these items and the other components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below 
service charges on deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in volume of consumer and business account overdraft fees 
service charges on deposit accounts for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in overdraft fees  which were mostly related to consumer accounts 
mortgage fee income 
mortgage fee income for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreased mortgage loan activity with the housing and real estate downturn 
mortgage fee income for increased thousand  or percent  compared to due to a company wide focus on mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market 
all other noninterest income 
the aggregate of all other noninterest income accounts increased  thousand  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily due to gains realized from the sale of securities of  thousand for compared to thousand for  or an increase of  thousand

loan origination risk management 
in accordance with the company s decentralized banking model  loan decisions are made at the local office level 
the company utilizes an executive loan committee to assist lenders with the decision making and underwriting process of larger loan requests 
due to the diverse economic markets served by the company  evaluation and underwriting criterion may vary slightly by office 
overall  loans are extended after a review of the borrower s repayment ability  collateral adequacy  and overall credit worthiness 

table of contents part ii continued item continued commercial purpose  commercial real estate  and industrial loans are underwritten similar to other loans throughout the company 
the properties securing the company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location 
this diversity helps reduce the company s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry 
management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral  geography  and risk grade criteria 
the company also utilizes information provided by third party agencies to provide additional insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting the markets it serves 
the company extends loans to builders and developers that are secured by non owner occupied properties 
in such cases  the company reviews the overall economic conditions and trends for each market to determine the desirability of loans to be extended for residential construction and development 
sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre committed permanent loans from approved long term lenders  sales of developed property or an interim mini perm loan commitment from the company until permanent financing is obtained 
in some cases  loans are extended for residential loan construction for speculative purposes and are based on the perceived present and future demand for housing in a particular market served by the company 
these loans are monitored by on site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes  general economic conditions and trends  the demand for the properties  and the availability of long term financing 
the company originates consumer loans at the office level 
due to the diverse economic markets served by the company  underwriting criterion may vary slightly by office 
the company is committed to serving the borrowing needs of all markets served and  in some cases  adjusts certain evaluation methods to meet the overall credit demographics of each market 
consumer loans represent relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers to help minimize risk 
additionally  consumer trends and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis 
the company maintains an internal loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis 
results of these reviews are presented to management 
the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel  as well as the company s policies and procedures 
commercial  financial and agricultural 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans at december  increased percent from december  to million 
the company s commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small  medium and large businesses 
the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment 
while some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis  most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with the company s loan policy guidelines 
industry concentrations 
as of december  and december   there were no concentrations of loans within any single industry in excess of percent of total loans  as segregated by standard industrial classification code sic code 
the sic code is a federally designed standard industrial numbering system used by the company to categorize loans by the borrower s type of business 

table of contents part ii continued item continued collateral concentrations 
lending is concentrated in commercial and real estate primarily to local borrowers 
the company has a high concentration of real estate loans that could pose an adverse credit risk particularly with the current economic downturn in the real estate market 
in management s opinion  the balance of the loan portfolio is sufficiently diversified to avoid significant concentration of credit risk 
although the company has a diversified loan portfolio  a substantial portion of borrowers ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the viability of the real estate economic sector 
the continued downturn of the housing and real estate market that began in has resulted in an increase of real estate dependent problem loans 
these loans are centered primarily in the company s larger msa markets 
declining collateral real estate values that secure land development  construction and speculative real estate loans in the company s larger msa markets have resulted in increased loan loss provisions in large credit relationships 
colony is currently in eighteen counties in south and central georgia and include metropolitan markets in dougherty  lowndes  houston  chatham and muscogee counties 
as a result  the company originates and maintains large credit relationships with several commercial customers in the ordinary course of business 
the company considers large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of million prior to any portion being sold 
large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of million 
in addition to the company s normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits  the company s central credit committee must approve all new and renewed credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships 
the following table provides additional information on the company s large credit relationships outstanding at december  and december  december  december  number of period end balances number of period end balances relationships committed outstanding relationships committed outstanding large credit relationships million and greater million to million maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans at december  the table also presents the portion of loans that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index such as the prime rate 
due in one year or less after one  but within three years after three  but within five years after five years total loans with fixed interest rates loans with floating interest rates the company may renew loans at maturity when requested by a customer whose financial strength appears to support such renewal or when such renewal appears to be in the company s best interest 
in such instances  the company generally requires payment of accrued interest and may adjust the rate of interest  require a principal reduction or modify other terms of the loan at the time of renewal 

table of contents part ii continued item continued nonperforming assets and potential problem loans year end nonperforming assets and accruing past due loans were as follows loans accounted for on nonaccrual loans past due days or more other real estate foreclosed total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed assets total assets accruing past due loans days past due or more days past due total accruing past due loans nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and foreclosed real estate 
nonperforming assets at december  increased percent from december  the increase in nonperforming assets was primarily attributable to the under performance of residential real estate and land development loans given the downturn in the real estate market that began during the latter part of generally  loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become days past due and or management deems the collectibility of the principal and or interest to be in question  as well as when required by regulatory requirements 
loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is days or more past due 
for consumer loans  collectibility and loss are generally determined before the loan reaches days past due 
accordingly  losses on consumer loans are recorded at the time they are determined 
consumer loans that are days or more past due are generally either in liquidation payment status or bankruptcy awaiting confirmation of a plan 
once interest accruals are discontinued  accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations 
subsequent receipts on non accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal  and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
classification of a loan as non accrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest 
renegotiated loans are loans on which  due to deterioration in the borrower s financial condition  the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven 

table of contents part ii continued item continued foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans 
foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs  at the time of foreclosure 
write downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses 
on an ongoing basis  properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations 
write downs are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties 
allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for possible loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense  which represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for possible loan losses includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 and allowance allocations determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits  however  the entire allowance is available for any credit that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the company s control  including the performance of the company s loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
the company s allowance for possible loan losses consists of specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on impaired loans and historical valuation allowances for other loans with similar risk characteristics 
the allowances established for probable losses on impaired loans are based on a regular analysis and evaluation of classified loans 
loans are classified based on an internal credit risk grading process that evaluates  among other things i the obligor s ability to repay  ii the underlying collateral  if any  and iii the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates 
this analysis is performed at the branch level and is reviewed at the parent company level 
once a loan is classified  it is reviewed to determine whether the loan is impaired and  if impaired  a portion of the allowance for possible loan losses is specifically allocated to the loan 
specific valuation allowances are determined after considering the borrower s financial condition  collateral deficiencies  and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry  among other things 

table of contents part ii continued item continued the methodology used to assign an allowance to a nonimpaired loan is more subjective 
generally  the allowance assigned to nonimpaired loans is determined by applying historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics  adjusted for qualitative factors including the volume and severity of identified classified loans  changes in economic conditions  changes in credit policies or underwriting standards  and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
because the economic and business climate in any given industry or market  and its impact on any given borrower  can change rapidly  the risk profile of the loan portfolio is continually assessed and adjusted when appropriate 
notwithstanding these procedures  there still exists the possibility that our assessment could prove to be significantly incorrect and that an immediate adjustment to the allowance for loan losses would be required 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for each of these components on a quarterly basis 
peer comparisons  industry comparisons  and regulatory guidelines are also used in the determination of the general valuation allowance 
loans identified as losses by management  internal loan review  and or bank examiners are charged off 
an allocation for loan losses has been made according to the respective amounts deemed necessary to provide for the possibility of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
the allocation is based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for changes in experience among each category 
additional amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is subjective since it is based on judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which the charge offs may ultimately occur 
the following table shows a comparison of the allocation of the reserve for loan losses for the periods indicated 
reserve reserve reserve reserve reserve commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate farmland real estate other loans to individuals all other loans loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total end of period loans 
activity in the allowance for loan losses is presented in the following table 
there were no charge offs or recoveries related to foreign loans during any of the periods presented

the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses reflects loan quality trends  including the level of net charge offs or recoveries  among other factors 
the provision for loan losses increased million from million in to million in provisions were higher in compared to primarily due to the elevated risk of residential real estate and land development loans given the downturn in the real estate market that began in the last half of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed assets increased to percent at december  compared to percent a year ago 
during  provision for loan losses increased million from the million recorded in net charge offs in increased  thousand compared to while net charge offs in decreased thousand compared to net charge offs were fairly consistent during  and  however  the net charge offs increased significantly in primarily from the write down of non performing credits to current appraised values 
we anticipate an elevated amount of charge offs in as problem credits run through the collection process to resolution 

table of contents part ii continued item continued management believes the level of the allowance for loan losses was adequate as of december  should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses change  the company s estimate of probable loan losses could also change  which could affect the level of future provisions for possible loan losses

off balance sheet arrangements  commitments  guarantees  and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of december  payments for borrowings do not include interest 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
loan commitments and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used  the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements

these instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  performance letters of credit  guarantees and liability for assets held in trust 
such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the instruments become payable 
the company uses the same credit policies for these off balance sheet financial instruments as they do for instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments 
the company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of the company s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
the company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
loan commitments outstanding at december  are included in the preceding table 

table of contents part ii continued item continued standby letters of credit 
letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the company would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  the company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
the company s policies generally require that standby letters of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
standby letters of credit outstanding at december  are included in the preceding table 
capital and liquidity at december   shareholders equity totaled million compared to million at december  in addition to net income of million  other significant changes in shareholders equity during included million of dividends declared and an increase of thousand resulting from the stock grant plan 
the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity totaled thousand at december  compared to thousand at december  this fluctuation was mostly related to the after tax effect of changes in the fair value of securities available for sale 
under regulatory requirements  the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale does not increase or reduce regulatory capital and is not included in the calculation of risk based capital and leverage ratios 
regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure tier and total capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on balance sheet and off balance sheet items 
tier capital consists of common stock and qualifying preferred stockholders equity less goodwill 
tier capital consists of certain convertible  subordinated and other qualifying debt and the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
the company has no tier capital other than the allowance for loan losses 
using the capital requirements presently in effect  the tier ratio as of december  was percent and total tier and risk based capital was percent 
both of these measures compare favorably with the regulatory minimum of percent for tier and percent for total risk based capital 
the company s tier leverage ratio as of december  was percent  which exceeds the required ratio standard of percent 
for  average capital was million  representing percent of average assets for the year 
this compares to percent for the company paid a quarterly dividend of   and per common share during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  and quarterly dividends of   and per common share during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
this equates to a dividend payout ratio of percent in and percent in 
table of contents part ii continued item continued the company  primarily through the actions of its subsidiary bank  engages in liquidity management to ensure adequate cash flow for deposit withdrawals  credit commitments and repayments of borrowed funds 
needs are met through loan repayments  net interest and fee income and the sale or maturity of existing assets 
in addition  liquidity is continuously provided through the acquisition of new deposits  the renewal of maturing deposits and external borrowings 
management monitors deposit flow and evaluates alternate pricing structures to retain and grow deposits 
to the extent needed to fund loan demand  traditional local deposit funding sources are supplemented by the use of fhlb borrowings  brokered deposits and other wholesale deposit sources outside the immediate market area 
internal policies have been updated to monitor the use of various core and non core funding sources  and to balance ready access with risk and cost 
through various asset liability management strategies  a balance is maintained among goals of liquidity  safety and earnings potential 
internal policies that are consistent with regulatory liquidity guidelines are monitored and enforced by the bank 
the investment portfolio provides a ready means to raise cash if liquidity needs arise 
as of december   the company held million in bonds excluding fhlb stock  at current market value in the available for sale portfolio 
at december   the available for sale bond portfolio totaled million 
only marketable investment grade bonds are purchased 
although most of the bank s bond portfolios are encumbered as pledges to secure various public funds deposits  repurchase agreements  and for other purposes  management can restructure and free up investment securities for a sale if required to meet liquidity needs 
management continually monitors the relationship of loans to deposits as it primarily determines the company s liquidity posture 
colony had ratios of loans to deposits of percent as of december  and percent at december  management employs alternative funding sources when deposit balances will not meet loan demands 
the ratios of loans to all funding sources excluding subordinated debentures at december  and december  were percent and percent  respectively 
management continues to emphasize programs to generate local core deposits as our company s primary funding sources 
the stability of the bank s core deposit base is an important factor in colony s liquidity position 
a heavy percentage of the deposit base is comprised of accounts of individuals and small businesses with comprehensive banking relationships and limited volatility 
at december  and december   the bank had million and million  respectively  in certificates of deposit of  or more 
these larger deposits represented percent and percent of respective total deposits 
management seeks to monitor and control the use of these larger certificates  which tend to be more volatile in nature  to ensure an adequate supply of funds as needed 
relative interest costs to attract local core relationships are compared to market rates of interest on various external deposit sources to help minimize the company s overall cost of funds 
local market deposit sources proved insufficient to fund the strong loan growth trends at colony over the past several years 
the company supplemented deposit sources with brokered deposits 
as of december   the company had million  or percent of total deposits  in brokered certificates of deposit attracted by external third parties 
additionally  the bank uses external wholesale or internet services to obtain out of market certificates of deposit at competitive interest rates when funding is needed 

table of contents part ii continued item continued to plan for contingent sources of funding not satisfied by both local and out of market deposit balances  colony and its subsidiary have established multiple borrowing sources to augment their funds management 
the company has borrowing capacity through membership of the federal home loan bank program 
the bank has also established overnight borrowing for federal funds purchased through various correspondent banks 
management believes the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet the company s liquidity needs in the future without any material adverse impact on operating results 
liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure  the ability to liquidate assets  and the availability of alternative sources of funds 
the company seeks to ensure its funding needs are met by maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management 
asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits in banks  securities available for sale  maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity  and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits 
should the need arise  the company also maintains relationships with the federal home loan bank and several correspondent banks that can provide funds on short notice 
since colony is a bank holding company and does not conduct operations  its primary sources of liquidity are dividends up streamed from its subsidiary bank and borrowings from outside sources 
the liquidity position of the company is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate 
management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity  which if implemented  would have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents part ii continued item continued impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap presently requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other things  as further discussed in the next section 
regulatory and economic policies the company s business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other things 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowing by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
for that reason alone  the policies of the federal reserve board have a material effect on the earnings of the company 
governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future  however  the company cannot accurately predict the nature  timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on its future business and earnings

table of contents part ii continued item continued colony bankcorp  inc and subsidiary interest rate sensitivity the following table is an analysis of the company s interest rate sensitivity position at december  the interest bearing rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing period  is based upon maturity or first repricing opportunity  along with a cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap 
it is important to note that the table indicates a position at a specific point in time and may not be reflective of positions at other times during the year or in subsequent periods 
major changes in the gap position can be  and are  made promptly as market outlooks change 
assets and liabilities repricing within months to to over or less months year years years total in thousands earning assets interest bearing deposits federal funds sold investment securities loans  net of unearned income other interest bearing assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings time deposits other borrowings subordinated debentures federal funds purchased securities sold under agreement to repurchase total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of interest earning assets cumulative interest rate sensitivity as a percentage of interest earning assets interest bearing demand and savings accounts for repricing purposes are considered to reprice within months or less 
short term borrowings for repricing purposes are considered to reprice within months or less 

table of contents part ii continued item continued the foregoing table indicates that we had a one year negative gap of million  or percent of total assets at december  in theory  this would indicate that at december   million more in liabilities than assets would reprice if there were a change in interest rates over the next days 
thus  if interest rates were to decline  the gap would indicate a resulting increase in net interest margin 
however  changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and our supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of repricing of both the assets and our supporting liability can remain the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as a basis risk and  generally  relates to the repricing characteristics of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposits 
gap analysis has certain limitations 
measuring the volume of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities does not always measure the full impact on the portfolio value of equity or net interest income 
gap analysis does not account for rate caps on products  dynamic changes such as increasing prepay speeds as interest rates decrease  basis risk  or the benefit of non rate funding sources 
the majority of our loan portfolio reprices quickly and completely following changes in market rates  while non term deposit rates in general move slowly and usually incorporate only a fraction of the change in rates 
products categorized as nonrate sensitive  such as our noninterest bearing demand deposits  in the gap analysis behave like long term fixed rate funding sources 
both of these factors tend to make our actual behavior more asset sensitive that is indicated in the gap analysis 
in fact  we experience higher net interest income when rates rise  opposite what is indicated by the gap analysis 
also  during the recent period of declines in interest rates  our net interest margin has declined 
therefore  management uses gap analysis  net interest margin analysis and market value of portfolio equity as our primary interest rate risk management tools 
the company is now utilizing ftn financial asset liability management analysis for a more dynamic analysis of balance sheet structure 
the company has established earnings at risk for net interest income in a basis point rate shock to be no more than a fifteen percent percentage change 
the most recent analysis as of december  indicates that net interest income would deteriorate percent with a basis point decrease and would improve percent with a basis point increase 
the company has established equity at risk in a basis point rate shock to be no more than a twenty percent percentage change 
the most recent analysis as of december  indicates that net economic value of equity percentage change would increase percent with a basis point increase and would decrease percent with a basis point decrease 
the company has established its one year gap to be percent to percent 
the most recent analysis as of december  indicates a one year gap of percent 
the analysis reflects net interest margin compression in a declining interest rate environment 
given that interest rates have basically bottomed out with the recent federal reserve action  the company is anticipating interest rates to increase in the future though we believe that interest rates will remain flat most of the company is focusing on areas to minimize margin compression in the future by minimizing longer term fixed rate loans  shortening on the yield curve with investments  securing longer term fhlb advances  securing brokered certificates of deposit for longer terms and focusing on reduction of nonperforming assets
