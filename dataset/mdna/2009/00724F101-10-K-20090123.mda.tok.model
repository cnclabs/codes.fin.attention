we distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers  vars  systems integrators  isvs and oems  direct to end users and through our own web site at www 
adobe 
com 
we also license our technology to hardware manufacturers  software developers and service providers  and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes 
we have operations in the americas  emea and asia 
our software runs on personal computers with microsoft windows  apple os  linux  unix and various non pc platforms  depending on the product 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  stock based compensation  goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or 
table of contents services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
in addition  we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns  price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded 
in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
product returns may be more or less than what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
there could be a delay in the release of our products 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product 
when evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories 
changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
our consulting revenue is recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures  such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
accordingly  our estimates of consulting revenue could differ from actual events and may materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected 
table of contents term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  during the second quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
in addition  we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities  including a current examination by the irs for our fiscal  and tax returns 
these examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations overview of during fiscal  our software and technologies continued to redefine how people engage with ideas and information anytime  anywhere and through virtually any medium 
given our solid execution during the year  we were able to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth when compared to the previous year 

table of contents in our creative solutions segment  revenue increased by nine percent during fiscal as compared to fiscal  based on continued adoption of our cs family of products during the first three quarters of fiscal  as well as the release of our new cs family of products which began shipping in the fourth quarter of the year 
consisting of six creative suite editions and thirteen individual creative products  our cs family of products launch was the largest in our more than year history 
although reviews and market commentary about our new cs family of products were overwhelmingly positive  we believe revenue from the fourth quarter launch was significantly impacted by the global financial crisis that is affecting demand in the creative professional end user market 
helping to drive the growth we achieved in our creative solutions business was a thirteen percent growth with our professional digital imaging products during fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  we achieved strong growth in our scene business 
revenue increased by more than twenty percent with our digital imaging and digital video hobbyist markets with the introduction of new versions of our adobe photoshop elements and adobe premiere elements products during the fourth quarter 
business productivity solutions achieved greater than fifteen percent increase in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal this success was driven by continued adoption of our acrobat family of products  as well as adoption of its successor  acrobat  which was released in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
in addition  our execution in driving our enterprise business with our livecycle product family resulted in more than a thirty percent increase in revenue in this business during fiscal as compared to fiscal  with revenue exceeding million 
we also continued to grow our acrobat connect pro business which provides real time collaboration capabilities via the web utilizing our adobe flash player 
our mobile and device solutions segment achieved greater than growth during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to the ongoing success we have had targeting mobile operators  handset manufacturers and consumer electronic device manufactures with our flash lite technology 
on may   we announced the open screen project 
the project aims to enable a consistent runtime environment that will remove barriers for developers and designers as they publish content and applications across desktops and consumer devices  including phones  mobile internet devices mids and set top boxes 
as part of the project  we will be removing some restrictions on the use of some of our technology specifications and publishing several technology protocols 
we will also be removing the license fees on the next major releases of adobe flash player and adobe air for devices 
accordingly  we expect revenue from mobile and device solutions to decrease beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we would expect this decrease to be offset in time by an increased demand for tooling products  server technologies  services and applications 
in our other segments  revenue increased by fifteen percent compared to fiscal due primarily to higher revenue with our platform business and the sustaining of revenue in our legacy print and publishing business 
revenue fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product percentage of total revenue services and support percentage of total revenue total revenue in fiscal  we categorized our products into the following segments creative solutions  knowledge worker  enterprise  mobile and device solutions  platform and print and publishing products

we are combining our former mobile and device solutions segment with our platform segment 
these segment reporting changes reflect changes we have made internally in terms of how we manage these businesses

see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this lease extension 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities decreased million for a total of billion in fiscal as compared to cash used for the same period last year  primarily due to net borrowings under our credit agreement of million 
additionally  we had lower purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year see sections entitled stock repurchase program i and stock repurchase program ii discussed below  offset in part by lower proceeds related to the issuance of treasury stock 
net cash used for financing activities increased million for a total of billion during fiscal as compared to cash used of million during fiscal increases were primarily due to additional purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year 
cash used for stock repurchases increased due to a higher average cost per share  a greater number of shares being repurchased and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements 
see the following sections titled stock repurchase program i and stock repurchase program ii discussed below 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including short term and long term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  product support and administrative staff 
furthermore  cash may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
the board of directors has approved a facilities expansion for our operations in india  which may include the purchase of land and buildings 
as previously disclosed  we plan to invest million directly in venture capital  of which  approximately million has already been invested 
we expect the remaining balance to be invested over the next three to five years 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities impacting a total of approximately full time positions globally 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately of these full time positions globally 
as of november   million was paid 
the remaining accrual associated with these termination benefits is expected to be substantially paid during fiscal in fiscal  we expect to record approximately million to million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and approximately million to million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of approximately of the remaining full time positions globally 
we expect to pay this facility related liability through fiscal our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal in the event of a further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we also increased our existing million credit facility to billion 
the purpose of the credit facility is to provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes including stock repurchases 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our credit agreement 
we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash 
external investment firms managed  on average  of our consolidated invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal within the us  the portfolio is invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 
outside of the us  our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury securities 
stock repurchase program i to facilitate our stock repurchase program  designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances  we repurchase shares in the open market and also enter into structured repurchases with third parties 
authorization to repurchase shares to cover on going dilution is not subject to expiration 
however  this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our board of directors from time to time 
as part of this program  on april   the board of directors approved the use of an additional billion for stock repurchases commencing upon the close of the macromedia acquisition 
this additional billion in stock repurchases was completed by the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal and  we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions  whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of million and billion  respectively 
we entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price vwap of our common stock over a specified period of time 
we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions 
there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases 
under the terms of the agreements  there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us 
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term 
the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the contract  the number of trading days in the contract  the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal during fiscal  we also repurchased million shares at an average price of in open market transactions 

table of contents for fiscal and  the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet at the payment date  though only shares physically delivered to us by november  and november  were excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share 
all outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of november  under this program will expire on or before march  as of november  and november   approximately million and million  respectively  of up front payments remained under the agreements 
see item  market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  for share repurchases during the quarter ended november  stock repurchase program ii under this stock repurchase program  we had authorization to repurchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of november   consist of obligations under operating leases  royalty agreements and various service agreements 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments 

table of contents contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of november  total less than year years years over years total non cancellable operating leases total purchase commitments total debt total as of november   the principal outstanding under the credit agreement was million which is due in full no later than february  interest associated with this agreement cannot be estimated with certainty by period throughout the term since it is based on a fluctuating interest rate calculation 
as a result of adopting fin  we reclassified million from current income taxes payable to long term income taxes payable related to unrecognized tax benefits 
the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at november  was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
while it is reasonably possible that some issues with the irs and other examinations could be resolved within the next months  based upon the current facts and circumstances  we cannot estimate the timing of such resolution or range of potential changes as it relates to the unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as part of our financial statements 
we do not expect any material settlements in fiscal but it is inherently uncertain to determine 
two of our lease agreements and our credit agreement are subject to financial covenants 
as of november   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants and we expect to remain in compliance during the next months 
we believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements  we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
guarantees the lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
as such  we recognized million and million in liabilities  related to the extended east and west towers and almaden tower leases  respectively 
these liabilities are recorded in other long term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets 
the balance will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the leases 
as of november   the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long term liabilities and prepaid rent was million 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 

table of contents to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director s or officer s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
as part of our limited partnership interests in adobe ventures  we have provided a general indemnification to granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures  for certain events or occurrences while granite ventures is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity provided that granite ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnership 
we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim  but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency hedging instruments in countries outside the us  we transact business  in us dollars and in various other currencies 
in europe and japan  transactions that are denominated in euro and yen are subject to exposure from movements in exchange rates 
we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts for yen or euro denominated revenue 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were billion yen  billion yen and billion yen  respectively 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were million euros  million euros and million euros  respectively 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen and our european operating expenses are primarily in euro  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and forward contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
as of november   total outstanding contracts were million which included the notional equivalent of million in euro  million in yen and million in other foreign currencies 
these hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue 
as of november   all contracts were set to expire at various times through july the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk  we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
in addition  we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional currency foreign subsidiaries 
as of november  and november   this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time  we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 

table of contents economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other income loss on the consolidated statement of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended november   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at november   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries  revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities 
privately held long term investments the privately held companies in which we invest  can still be considered in the start up or development stages which are inherently risky 
the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies 
the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to 
table of contents the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 
see note and note for information regarding our limited partnership interest in adobe ventures 
short term investments and marketable equity securities we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of november   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million compared to million at november  the decrease was primarily due to the change in the fair value of our equity holdings during fiscal the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities as of november   that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
fair value deteriorations of  and were selected for illustrative purposes because none is more likely to occur than another 
marketable equity securities short term investments and fixed income securities at november   we had debt securities classified as short term investments of billion 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments 
the table below separates these investments  based on stated maturities  to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 
due within one year due within two years due within three years due after three years total a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of november  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes 
in prior years the analysis had been performed for time periods of months and months 
in the current year we have modified the analysis to model the effect of an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve 
this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 
the following tables present the hypothetical fair values in millions of our debt securities classified as short term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points bps  bps and bps 
the analysis is shown as of november  and november  bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps the portfolio at was more sensitive to changes in interest rates than at due to the larger size and a greater weighted average duration years at compared to years at
