executive overview marketing  promotional and advertising spending by consumer products companies and retailers drives a majority of the company s revenues 
the markets served are primarily consumer products  pharmaceutical  entertainment and retail 
the company s business in this area involves producing graphic images for various applications 
generally  the company or a third party creates an image and then the image is manipulated to enhance the color and to prepare it for print 
the applications vary from consumer product packaging  including food and beverage packaging images  to retail advertisements in newspapers  including freestanding inserts fsi s and magazine ads 
the graphics process is generally the same regardless of the application 
the following steps in the graphics process must take place to produce a final image strategic analysis planning and messaging conceptual design content creation file building retouching art production pre media the company s involvement in a client project may involve many of the above steps or just one of the steps  depending on the client s needs 
each client assignment  or job  is a custom job in that the image being produced is unique  even if it only involves a small change from an existing image  such as adding a low fat banner on a food package 
essentially  such changes equal new revenue for us 
the company is paid for its graphic imaging work regardless of the success or failure of the food product  the promotion or the ad campaign 
historically  a substantial majority of the company s revenues have been derived from providing graphic services for consumer product packaging applications 
packaging changes occur with regular frequency and lack of notice  and client turn around requirements are so tight  that there is little backlog 
there are regular promotions throughout the year that create revenue opportunities for us  for example valentine s day  easter  fourth of july  back to school  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  there are event driven promotions that occur regularly  such as the super bowl  grammy awards  world series  indianapolis and the olympics 
additionally  changing regulatory requirements necessitate new packaging and a high degree of documentation 
lastly  there are a number of health related banners that are added to food and beverage packaging  such as heart healthy  low in carbohydrates  enriched with essential vitamins  low in saturated fat and caffeine free 
all of these items require new product packaging designs or changes in existing designs  in each case creating additional opportunities for revenue 
graphic services for the consumer products packaging industry generally involve higher margins due to the substantial expertise necessary to meet consumer products companies precise specifications and to quickly  consistently and efficiently bring their products to market  as well as due to the complexity and variety of packaging materials  shapes and sizes  custom colors and storage conditions 
as a result of recent acquisitions  the company has increased the percentage of its revenue derived from providing graphics services to advertising and retail clients and added to its service offering graphic services to the entertainment market 
these clients typically require high volume  commodity oriented premedia graphic services 

table of contents graphic services for these clients typically yield relatively lower margins due to the lower degree of complexity in providing such services  and the number and size of companies in the industry capable of providing such services 
in  approximately percent of the company s total revenues came from its largest single client 
while the company seeks to build long term client relationships  revenues from any particular client can fluctuate from period to period due to the client s purchasing patterns 
any termination of or significant reduction in the company business relationship with any of its principal clients could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent acquisitions the company has grown its business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
schawk has completed approximately acquisitions since the company s recent acquisitions have significantly expanded its service offerings and its geographic presence  making us the only independent premedia firm with substantial operations in north america  europe and asia 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company is able to offer a broader range of services to its clients

in december  the company s canadian subsidiary entered into a revolving demand credit facility with a canadian bank to provide working capital needs up to million canadian dollars 
the credit line is guaranteed by the company 
there was no balance outstanding on this credit line at december  amendments to revolving credit facility and note purchase agreements as a result of a goodwill impairment charges and restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of  compounded by the company s stock repurchase program and weaker earnings performance  in june the company entered into amendments that  among other things  restructured its leverage and minimum net worth covenants under its revolving credit facility and note purchase agreements 
in particular the amendments reduced the size of the company s revolving credit facility by million  from million expandable to million to million  after the payment of million on or before september   the size of the company s revolving credit facility will be further reduced to million  which  based on the company s june  outstanding revolving credit balance  is expected to provide approximately million of available credit  increased the company s maximum permitted cash flow leverage ratio from to for the first quarter of  decreasing to in the fourth quarter of and thereafter  amended the credit facility s pricing terms  including increasing the interest rate margin applicable on the revolving credit facility indebtedness to a variable rate of libor plus to basis points bps  depending on the cash flow leverage ratio  and set the minimum libor at percent  increased the unused revolver commitment fee rate to bps per year

per share based on the number of shares of common stock currently outstanding  require the company to obtain lender approval of any acquisitions  revised the company s minimum consolidated net worth covenant to be based on percent of the company s consolidated net worth as of march   reduced the amount of the company s permitted capital expenditures to million  from million  during any fiscal year  and provide a waiver for any noncompliance with certain financial covenants  as well as with covenants relating to i the reduction of indebtedness within prescribed time periods using the proceeds of a previously completed asset sale  ii the payment of dividends  and iii the delivery of the company s annual and quarterly financial statements for the periods ended december  and march   respectively  within prescribed time periods 
in addition  all amounts due under the credit facility and the outstanding notes are now secured through liens on substantially all of the company s and its domestic subsidiaries personal property 
as part of the credit facility amendments  the note purchase agreements associated with its outstanding senior notes were amended to include financial and other covenants that are the same as or substantially equivalent to the revised financial and other covenants under its amended credit facility 
management believes that the level of working capital is adequate for the company s liquidity needs related to normal operations both currently and in the foreseeable future  and that the company has sufficient resources to support its operations  either through currently available cash and cash generated from future operations  or pursuant to its renegotiated credit facility 
the company s ability to realize its near term business objectives is subject to  among other things  its ability to remain in compliance with its covenants under its debt arrangements 
based on its business plan  which contains a number of assumptions related to economic trends and the company s business and operations  the company presently expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants for the foreseeable future  however compliance in and thereafter remains subject to many variables  including those described under risk factors contained in this report 
if the company is not able to remain in compliance with its debt covenants  its lenders could restrict the company s ability to draw further on its credit facility or could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the company s material debt arrangements to be immediately due and payable 
either event would materially adversely affect the company s liquidity and  in turn  its business and financial condition 
if the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness due to any covenant breach  the company s assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness and any other indebtedness that would become due as a result of any acceleration 
see risk factors for a more detailed discussion of certain of the factors that could adversely affect the company s business 
additionally  the company will need to renew  extend or enter into a new credit facility prior to the expiration of its revolving credit facility in january  however  there can be no assurances that it will be able to successfully negotiate a replacement facility or refinance any of its debt  including its revolving credit facility in january or its senior notes as they become due  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the company operates in thirteen countries besides the united states 
the company currently believes that there are no political  economic or currency restrictions that materially limit the company s flexibility in managing its global cash resources

cash flows from its historically profitable operations have permitted the company to re invest in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions of complementary businesses 
over the next five years  assuming no significant business acquisitions  capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of to million annually 
also  over the next five years  the company s revolving credit facility and most of its long term private placement debt matures  including million of debt that matures in the company s total contractual obligations over the next five years total approximately million  including all debt obligations see contractual obligation table below 
at this time  the company believes that cash flow from operations and its ability to refinance its maturing debt obligations will be sufficient to finance the company during the next five years  assuming no significant business acquisitions 
if a significant acquisition is undertaken in the next five years  the company believes that it will have sufficient access to both debt and equity markets to finance such an acquisition without unduly burdening the company s balance sheet or cash flows

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its critical accounting estimates are limited to those described below 
accounts receivable 
the company s clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  advertising agencies  retailers  both grocery and non grocery and entertainment companies 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to schawk from its normal business activities 
in assessing the carrying value of its accounts receivable  the company estimated the recoverability by making assumptions based on its historical write off experience and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos of million was established at december   compared to an allowance of million at december  a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the consumer packaging industry  a loss of a major customer or several customers  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is used or an adverse change in the physical condition of an asset 
the company s cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect its best estimate of future market and operating conditions and forecasts 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
the company s estimates of fair value represent its best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
during  the company recorded the following impairment charges million for land and buildings where the carrying values could not be supported by current appraised market values  million for internally developed software where a change in circumstances indicated that the future value of the software may not be recoverable  million to write down the carrying value of the company s large format print operation to fair value  and million for fixed assets  mainly related to leasehold improvements at a facility where the lease was terminated before the lease expiration date 
in addition  million of asset impairments  mainly for leasehold improvements at vacated facilities  were recorded in connection with the company s restructuring program  included in acquisition integration and restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations at december  a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  resulting in future additional impairment charges 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill  customer relationships and  to a lesser extent  other intangible assets 
effective in  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist 
events that may indicate potential impairment include a loss of or a significant decrease in volume from a major customer  a change in the expected useful life of an asset  a change in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  unanticipated competition relative to a major customer or the loss of key personnel relative to a major customer 
when a potential impairment condition has been identified  an impairment test of the intangible asset is performed  based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment write down of million for customer relationship intangible assets for which it was determined that future estimated cash flows 
table of contents did not support the carrying value 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  additional impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the company did not identify any other events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an impairment condition existed at december   with respect to its intangible assets other than goodwill 
the company historically performed an annual goodwill impairment test as of december each year  however  in the fourth quarter of  the company changed its annual test date to october st  commencing with the test for  in order to have the required testing completed prior to its year end closing activities 
this change did not delay  accelerate or avoid any impairment charge 
accordingly the company believes that this accounting change is preferable in its circumstances 
this change constitutes a change in accounting principle under sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  sfas no 
 a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

the company performed the required impairment test as of october  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets as amended and the relevant provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  the company assigned its goodwill to multiple reporting units  mainly on a geographic basis at a level below the operating segments 
using projections of operating cash flow for each reporting unit  the company performed a step one assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit 
the step one impairment analysis indicated a potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the company s european and anthem reporting units 
the company then prepared a step two valuation of the european and anthem reporting units and concluded  after assigning fair values to all assets and liabilities of these reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  that goodwill for the european and anthem reporting units was impaired by million and million  respectively 
the company recorded this impairment adjustment in the fourth quarter of see note goodwill and intangible assets for further information 
a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  and or a significant decrease in the market value of the company s common stock could result in additional impairment charges 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and net operating losses will not be realized 
federal  state and foreign tax authorities regularly audit us  like other multi national companies  and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as amended an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin no 
contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
actual outcomes could result in a change in reported income tax expense for a particular period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company has provided valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  primarily arising from the acquisition of seven in  due to the dormancy of the companies generating the tax assets or due to income tax rules limiting the availability of the losses to offset future taxable income 
exit reserves 
the company records reserves for the consolidation of workforce and facilities of acquired companies 
the exit plans are approved by company management prior to  or shortly after  the acquisition date 
the exit plans provide for severance pay  lease abandonment costs and other related expenses 
a change in any of the assumptions used to estimate the exit reserves that result in a decrease to the reserve would result in a decrease to 
table of contents goodwill 
any change in assumptions that result in an increase to the exit reserves would result in a charge to income 
during  the company recorded a reduction to its exit reserves for the seven worldwide acquisition in the amount of million  primarily due to changes in sublease assumptions at several vacated facilities 
at december   the company had exit reserves of approximately million that were included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  for exit activities completed in through  primarily for facility closure costs 
future increases or decreases in these reserves are possible  as the company continues to assess changes in circumstance that would alter the future cost assumptions used in the calculation of the reserves 
however  the company believes that  because the current exit reserves are diminishing  any further changes to the exit reserves would be immaterial to its consolidated financial statements

r  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  but retains the requirement that the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
r expands on the disclosures previously required by sfas no 
 better defines the acquirer and the acquisition date in a business combination  and establishes principles for recognizing and measuring the assets acquired including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interests in the acquired business 
sfas r changes the accounting for acquisition related costs from being included as part of the purchase price of a business acquired to being expensed as incurred and will require the acquiring company to recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally to be reflected in earnings  as opposed to additional purchase price of the acquired business 
as the company has a history of growing its business through acquisitions  the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on its results of operations in future periods  which impact depends on the size and the number of acquisitions it consummates in the future 
sfas no 
r also requires an acquirer to record an adjustment to income tax expense for changes in valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions related to acquired businesses 
certain of the company s acquisitions consummated in prior years would be subject to changes in accounting for the changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
after december   reductions of valuation allowances would reduce the income tax provision as opposed to goodwill

 determining the useful life of intangible assets fsp no 

fsp amends the factors to be considered in determining the useful life of intangible assets 
its intent is to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure its fair value by allowing an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing or extending the useful life of a recognized intangible asset

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure the company has million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  and expects to use its variable rate credit facilities during and beyond to fund acquisitions and cash flow needs 
the debt is variable to the eurocurrency rates 
assuming interest rate volatility in the future is similar to what has been seen in recent years  the company does not anticipate that short term changes in interest rates will materially affect its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
an adverse change of percent in interest rates from percent at december  to percent would add approximately million of interest cost annually based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december  the company does not actively manage interest rate exposure on variable rate debt and the company does not currently hedge its interest rate exposures 
the company s remaining debt is fixed at rates that range from percent to percent 
foreign exchange exposure the company is subject to changes in various foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  chinese yuan  malaysian ringgit and the australian dollar 
the company s results of operations were adversely affected by the increase in value of the us dollar relative to most foreign currencies that occurred during the second half of an additional adverse change of percent in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in sales of million  or percent  and an increase in income before income taxes of million  or percent  for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and december   the company recorded pre tax foreign exchange losses gains of million and million respectively 
these losses gains were recorded by international subsidiaries primarily for unhedged currency exposure arising from intercompany debt obligations 
these losses gains are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company does not currently hedge its foreign currency exposures
