item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following table shows our backlog from continuing operations by operating segment and geographic location as of december  and year ended december  amount percent amount percent upstream oil gas downstream oil gas engineering total backlog december  december  amount percent amount percent geographic region united states canada oman total backlog year ended december  total backlog competition we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we compete against government owned or supported companies and other companies that have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us 
in certain markets  we compete against national and regional firms against which we may not be price competitive 
we have different competitors in different markets 
in the united states  our primary upstream oil and gas construction competitors on a national basis include associated pipeline contractors  price gregory services  sheehan pipeline construction  us pipeline and welded construction 
in addition  there are a number of regional competitors  such as sunland  dyess  flint  and jomax 
our primary competitors in the downstream oil and gas market include altairstrickland  jv industrial companies  plant performance services  kbr  chicago bridge iron and matrix services 
our primary competitors in the engineering market include chm hill  gulf interstate  universal ensco  trigon  mustang engineering and englobal engineering 
our primary competitors for international onshore construction projects in developing countries include technip france  ccc lebanon  saipem italy  spie capag france  techint argentina  bechtel us  stroytransgaz russia  tekfen turkey  and nacap netherlands 
in canada  competitors for onshore pipeline construction assignments include north american energy services  flint energy services and oj pipelines 
as a result  we may be more cost effective than our competitors in certain instances or offer a superior value proposition 
in oman  competitors in oil field transport services include ofsat and truckoman  both omani companies  and in construction and the installation of flow lines and mechanical services  we compete with gulf petrochemical services oman  ccc lebanon  dodsal india  saipem italy  special technical services oman and galfar oman 
contract provisions and subcontracting most of our revenue is derived from engineering  construction and epc contracts 
the majority of our contracts fall into the following basic categories firm fixed price or lump sum fixed price contracts  providing for a single price for the total amount of work or for a number of fixed lump sums for the various work elements comprising the total price  cost plus fixed fee contracts under which income is earned solely from the fee received 
bidding cost plus fixed fee contracts has been the focus of our large pipeline construction project efforts in  but we anticipate this will decrease in  unit price contracts  which specify a price for each unit of work performed  time and materials contracts  under which personnel and equipment are provided under an agreed schedule of daily rates with other direct costs being reimbursable  and a combination of the above such as lump sums for certain items and unit rates for others 
changes in scope of work are subject to change orders to be agreed upon by both parties 
change orders not agreed to in either scope or price result in claims to be resolved in a dispute resolution process 
these change orders and claims can affect our contract revenue either positively or negatively 
we usually obtain contracts through competitive bidding or through negotiations with long standing clients 
we are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by our clients who maintain approved bidder lists 
bidders are pre qualified by virtue of their prior performance for such clients  as well as their experience  reputation for quality  safety record  financial strength and bonding capacity 
in evaluating bid opportunities  we consider such factors as the client  the geographic location  the difficulty of the work  our current and projected workload  the likelihood of additional work  the project s cost and profitability estimates  and our competitive advantage relative to other likely bidders 
we give careful thought and consideration to the political and financial stability of the country or region where the work is to be performed 
the bid estimate forms the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project control system  enabling management to monitor projects effectively 
all us government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client 
in addition  some contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements that require us to pay liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances within our control 
we act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake 
in our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor  we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only such specialized activities as hazardous waste removal  horizontal directional drills  non destructive inspection  and catering and security 
in the construction industry  the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  when acting as a prime contractor  we are subject to the risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
under a fixed price contract  we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project  based upon specific assumptions and project criteria 
if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur  our margins will decrease  and we may incur a loss 
the revenue  cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks  we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and may incur losses on projects 
depending on the size of a project  these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year 
in some cases  we are able to recover additional costs and profits from the client through the change order process 
in general  turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations 
this is a result of the long term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs  and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract 
our accounting policy related to contract variations and claims requires recognition of all costs as incurred 
revenue from change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work is recognized when an agreement is reached with the client as to the scope of work and when it is probable that the cost of such work will be recovered in a change in contract price 
profit on change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
also included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on uncompleted contracts are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design  contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs unapproved change orders 
these amounts are recorded at their estimated net realizable value when realization is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded unapproved change orders may be made in the near term 
if we do not successfully resolve these matters  a net expense recorded as a reduction in revenues  may be required  in addition to amounts that have been previously provided 
employees at december   we employed directly a multi national work force of  persons  of which approximately percent were citizens of the respective countries in which they work 
although the level of activity varies from year to year  we have maintained an average work force of approximately  over the past five years 
the minimum employment during that period has been  and the maximum was  at december   approximately percent of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe relations with our employees are satisfactory 
the following table sets forth the location of employees by work countries as of december  number of employees percent us upstream oil gas us downstream oil gas us engineering us administration canada oman other total equipment we own  lease and maintain a fleet of generally standardized construction  transportation and support equipment 
in and  expenditures for capital equipment were approximately  and  respectively 
at december   the net book value of our property  plant  and equipment was approximately  we are constantly evaluating the availability of equipment and in recent years have leased equipment to ensure its availability to support projects 
we entered into various capital leases in and adding approximately  of equipment during these periods 
we continue to evaluate expected equipment utilization  given anticipated market conditions  and may buy or lease new equipment and dispose of underutilized equipment from time to time 
all equipment is subject to scheduled maintenance to maximize fleet readiness 
we have maintenance facilities at azaiba  oman  ft

we maintain worldwide master policies written mostly through highly rated insurers 
these policies cover our property  plant  equipment and cargo against all normally insurable risks  including war risk  political risk and terrorism in third world countries 
other policies cover our workers and liabilities arising out of our operations 
primary and excess liability insurance limits are consistent with the level of our asset base 
risks of loss or damage to project works and materials are often insured on our behalf by our clients 
on other projects  builders all risk insurance is purchased when deemed necessary 
substantially all insurance is purchased and maintained at the corporate level  other than certain basic insurance  which must be purchased in some countries in order to comply with local insurance laws 
the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 
an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the future  our ability to maintain insurance  which may not be available or at rates we consider reasonable  may be affected by events over which we have no control  such as those that occurred on september  in we were not constrained by our ability to bond new projects  nor have we been negatively impacted in early item a 
risk factors the nature of our business and operations subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks 
risks related to our business our business is highly dependent upon the level of capital expenditures by oil  gas and power companies on infrastructure 
our revenue and cash flow are primarily dependent upon major engineering and construction projects 
the availability of these types of projects is dependent upon the economic condition of the oil  gas and power industries  specifically  the level of capital expenditures of oil  gas and power companies on infrastructure 
the current credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system  including capital markets  as well as a global recession  may have an adverse impact on the level of capital expenditures of oil  gas and power companies and or their ability to finance these expenditures 
our failure to obtain major projects  the delay in awards of major projects  the cancellation of major projects or delays in completion of contracts are factors that could result in the under utilization of our resources  which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow 
there are numerous factors beyond our control that influence the level of capital expenditures of oil  gas and power companies  including current and projected oil  gas and power prices as well as refining margins  the demand for electricity  the abilities of oil  gas and power companies to generate  access and deploy capital  exploration  production and transportation costs  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  the sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions  regulatory restraints on the rates that power companies may charge their customers  local and international political and economic conditions  the ability or willingness of host country government entities to fund their budgetary commitments  and technological advances 
our final settlements with the doj and the sec  and the prosecution of former employees that will follow  may negatively impact our ongoing operations 
as a result of our final settlements with the doj and the sec resolving their investigations of violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and other provisions of the federal securities laws  which are more fully described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k  we are subject to ongoing review and regulation of our business operations  including the review of our operations and compliance program by a government approved independent monitor 
the activities of the independent monitor will have a cost to us and may cause a change in our processes and operations  the outcome of which we are unable to predict 
in addition  the settlements  and the prosecution of former employees that will likely follow  may impact our operations or result in legal actions against us in countries that are the subject of the settlements 
the final settlements could also result in third party claims against us  which may include claims for special  indirect  derivative or consequential damages 
our failure to comply with the terms of settlement agreements with the doj and sec would have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 
under our final settlements with the doj and sec  we are subject to a three year deferred prosecution agreement and permanently enjoined from committing any future violations of the federal securities laws 
our failure to comply with the terms of the settlements with the doj and sec could result in resumed prosecution and other regulatory sanctions  and could otherwise negatively affect our operations 
in addition  if we fail to make timely payment of the penalty amounts due to the doj and or the disgorgement amounts specified in the sec settlement  the doj and or the sec will have the right to accelerate payment  and demand that the entire balance be paid immediately 
our ability to comply with the terms of the settlements is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program  including our supervision  training and retention of competent employees  the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and our foreign corrupt practices act compliance manual and code of business conduct and ethics  and our continuing management of our agents and business partners 
we may continue to experience losses associated with our prior nigeria based operations 
in february  we completed the sale of our nigerian operations 
in august  we and our subsidiary  willbros international services nigeria limited  entered into a global settlement agreement the global settlement agreement with ascot offshore nigeria limited ascot  the purchaser of our nigerian operations and berkeley group plc  the purchaser s parent company 
among the other matters  the global settlement agreement provided for the payment of an amount in full and final settlement of all disputes between ascot and us related to the working capital adjustment to the closing purchase price under the february share purchase agreement 
in connection with the sale of our nigerian operations  we also entered into a transition services agreement the transition services agreement  and ascot delivered a promissory note in favor of us 
the global settlement agreement provided for a settlement in the amount of million  the amount by which we and ascot agreed to adjust the closing purchase price downward the settlement amount 
under the global settlement agreement  we retained approximately million of the settlement amount and credited this amount to the account of ascot for amounts which were due to us under the transition services agreement and promissory note 
our payment of the balance of the settlement amount settled i any and all obligations and disputes between ascot and us in relation to the adjustment to the closing purchase price under the share purchase agreement and ii all of the parties respective rights and obligations under the indemnification provisions of the share purchase agreement  except as provided in the global settlement agreement 
as partial consideration for the parties agreement on the settlement amount  ascot secured with a non nigerian bank supplemental backstop letters of credit totaling approximately million  which backstopped corresponding letter of credit obligations that we had under various contracts taken over by ascot 
in the third quarter of  substantially all of our letters of credit related to our former operations in nigeria expired  with only one  of letter of credit remaining outstanding 
on february   the transition services agreement with ascot expired according to its terms 
we may  however  continue to experience losses or incur expenses subsequent to the sale and disposition of our operations and the global settlement agreement 
in particular the same difficulties which led to our leaving nigeria continue to exist for ascot  as well as additional challenges  including various financial difficulties that we understand ascot may from time to time be experiencing 
accordingly  ascot s continued willingness and ability to perform our former projects in west africa continue to be important factors to further reducing our risk profile in nigeria and elsewhere in west africa 
we issued parent company guarantees to our former clients in connection with the performance of some of our contracts in nigeria and nearby west africa locations 
although ascot is now responsible for completing these projects  our parent company guarantees may remain in force in varying degrees until the projects are completed 
indemnities are in place pursuant to which ascot and its parent company are obligated to indemnify us for any losses we incur under these parent company guarantees 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our indemnity rights 
the guarantees include five projects under which we estimated that  at february   there was aggregate remaining contract revenue of approximately million and aggregate cost to complete of approximately million 
in early  we received our first notification asserting various rights under one of our outstanding parent guarantees 
on february   wwai  the ascot company performing the west african gas pipeline wagp contract  received a letter from west african gas pipeline company limited wapco  the owner of wagp  wherein wapco gave written notice alleging that wwai was in default under the wagp contract  as amended  and giving wwai a brief cure period to remedy the alleged default 
we understand that wwai responded by denying being in breach of its wagp contract obligations  and apparently also advised wapco that wwai requires a further million  without which it will not be able to complete the work which it had previously undertaken to perform 
we understand that  on february   wapco terminated the wagp contract for the alleged continuing non performance of wwai 
on february   we received a letter from wapco reminding us of our parent guarantee on the wagp contract and requesting that we remedy wwai s default under that contract  as amended 
approximately on february   we received another letter from wapco formally demanding that we pay all sums payable in consequence of the non performance by ascot with wapco stating that quantification of that amount would be provided sometime in the future when the work was completed 
on previous occasions  we have advised wapco that  for a variety of legal  contractual  and other reasons  we did not consider our prior wagp contract parent guarantee to have continued application  and we reiterated that position to wapco in our response to its february  letter 
we will again reiterate our position in response to their february  letter 
wapco disputes our position that we are no longer bound by the terms of our prior parent guarantee of the wagp contract and has reserved all its rights in that regard 
currently  the wagp project is yet to be completed for a variety of technical and commercial reasons unrelated to wapco s termination of the wagp contract 
we anticipate that this developing dispute with wapco may result in a lengthy arbitration proceeding between wapco and wwai in the london court of international arbitration to determine the validity of the alleged default notice issued by wapco to wwai  including any resulting damage award  in combination with a lawsuit between wapco and us in the english courts under english law to determine the enforceability  in whole or in part  of our parent guarantee  which we expect to be a lengthy process 
we currently have no employees working in nigeria and we have no intention of returning to nigeria 
if ultimately it is determined by an english court that we are liable  in whole or in part  for damages that wapco may establish against wwai for wwai s alleged non performance of the wagp contract  or if wapco is able to establish liability against us directly under our parent company guarantee  and  in either case  we are unable to enforce our rights under the indemnity agreement entered into with ascot in connection with the wagp contract  we may experience substantial losses 
however  management cannot  at this time  predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation which may ensue in this developing wagp contract dispute  or be certain of the degree to which the indemnity agreement given in our favor by ascot will protect us 
based upon our current knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances  we do not expect that the outcome of the dispute will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december    and management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  identified a new material weakness and confirmed that a previously disclosed material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist 
we believe that these material weaknesses were successfully remediated as of june  we believe that the other material weaknesses reported as of december  were eliminated in february as a result of the sale of our nigerian assets and operations 
however  our inability to remediate these material weaknesses prior to february  our inability to remediate our most recent material weaknesses identified or existing as of december  prior to june   and any other control deficiencies that we may discover in the future  could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis 
as a result  our business  operating results and liquidity could be harmed 
as disclosed in our annual reports on form k for   and  management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting identified several material weaknesses 
these material weaknesses led to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and and the first three quarters of although we made progress in executing our remediation plans during and  including the remediation of three material weaknesses  as of december   management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to the following remaining material weaknesses in internal controls nigeria accounting during the fourth quarter of  we determined that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed related to the company s management control environment over the accounting for our nigeria operations 
this weakness in management control led to the inability to adequately perform various control functions including supervision over and consistency of inventory management  petty cash disbursements  accounts payable disbursement approvals  account reconciliations  and review of timekeeping records 
this material weakness resulted primarily from our inability to maintain a consistent and stable internal control environment over our nigeria operations in the fourth quarter of nigeria project controls estimate to complete a material weakness existed related to controls over the nigeria project reporting 
this weakness existed throughout and is a continuation of a material weakness reported in our form k 
the weakness primarily impacted one large nigeria project with a total contract value of approximately million  for which cost estimates were not updated timely in the fourth quarter of due to insufficient measures being taken to independently verify and update reliable cost estimates 
this material weakness specifically resulted in material changes to revenue and cost of sales during the preparation of our year end financial statements by our accounting staff prior to their issuance 
moreover  management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  identified a new material weakness and confirmed that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting previously identified on november  continued to exist 
the newly identified material weakness and the previously identified material weakness have both been successfully remediated as of june  the newly identified material weakness related to a lack of proper control over the update and renewal of the worker s compensation insurance rate master file 
the previously identified material weakness related to management s review of subcontract cost calculations for a project in canada 
the remediation plan for the material weakness relating to the lack of proper control over the update and review of the worker s compensation insurance rate master file consisted of developing additional documented control procedures to ensure the worker s compensation insurance rate master file is accurately updated in a timely manner and the worker s compensation insurance cost calculations are performed accurately using the updated master file data 
the remediation plan for the previously identified material weakness relating to management review of subcontract cost calculations began in the fourth quarter of and consisted of hiring an additional project controller  enhancing the management review process  and introducing system upgrades to automate certain processes  which management believes will prevent the omission of previously identified costs  such as those described above 
we believe that our most recent material weaknesses identified or existing as of december  were successfully remediated as of june  we also believe that our reported material weaknesses at december  were eliminated in february upon the sale of our nigeria assets and operations since those material weaknesses related solely to our operations in that country 
however  our inability to remediate these material weaknesses prior to february  our inability to remediate our most recent material weaknesses prior to june  and any other control deficiencies we identify in the future  could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis  which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity 
furthermore  because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud  even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements 
our international operations are subject to political and economic risks of developing countries 
although we sold our operations in nigeria and venezuela  we have operations in the middle east oman and anticipate that a portion of our contract revenue will be derived from  and a portion of our long lived assets will be located in  developing countries 
conducting operations in developing countries presents significant commercial challenges for our business 
a disruption of activities  or loss of use of equipment or installations  at any location in which we have significant assets or operations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  we are subject to risks that ordinarily would not be expected to exist to the same extent in the united states  canada  japan or western europe 
some of these risks include civil uprisings  terrorism  riots and war  which can make it impractical to continue operations  adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses  repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements and converting it into dollars or other fungible currency  exchange rate fluctuations  which can reduce the purchasing power of local currencies and cause our costs to exceed our budget  reducing our operating margin in the affected country  expropriation of assets  by either a recognized or unrecognized foreign government  which can disrupt our business activities and create delays and corresponding losses  availability of suitable personnel and equipment  which can be affected by government policy  or changes in policy  which limit the importation of skilled craftsmen or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient  governmental instability  which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential customers to be withdrawn or delayed  reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services  and decrees  laws  regulations  interpretations and court decisions under legal systems  which are not always fully developed and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs 
our operations in developing countries may be adversely affected in the event any governmental agencies in these countries interpret laws  regulations or court decisions in a manner which might be considered inconsistent or inequitable in the united states  canada  japan or western europe 
we may be subject to unanticipated taxes  including income taxes  excise duties  import taxes  export taxes  sales taxes or other governmental assessments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any quarter or year 
these risks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by a concentration of business in a particular country 
due to a limited number of major projects worldwide  we expect to have a substantial portion of our resources dedicated to projects located in a few countries 
therefore  our results of operations are susceptible to adverse events beyond our control that may occur in a particular country in which our business may be concentrated at that time 
economic downturns in such countries could also have an adverse impact on our operations 
special risks associated with doing business in highly corrupt environments may adversely affect our business 
although we have completed the sale of our nigeria operations  our international business operations may continue to include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent 
since the anti bribery restrictions of the fcpa make it illegal for us to give anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage  we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
we cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations  terminations  or scope adjustments may occur  from time to time  with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn 
many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them  in some cases without any provision for penalties or lost profits 
therefore  project terminations  suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog 
finally  poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits 
our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material adverse effect on us 
we occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price 
these types of claims occur due to matters such as owner caused delays or changes from the initial project scope  which result in additional costs  both direct and indirect 
these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings  and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved 
when these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending  we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims 
a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition 
our business is dependent on a limited number of key clients 
we operate primarily in the oil  gas  power and refinery industries  providing construction  engineering and facilities development and operations services to a limited number of clients 
much of our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with our major clients and obtaining a share of contracts from these clients 
the loss of any of our major clients could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
three substantial clients were responsible for percent of our backlog at december  our use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our operating results 
a portion of our projects is currently performed on a fixed price basis 
under a fixed price contract  we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project  based upon a defined scope  which includes specific assumptions and project criteria 
if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur  our margins will decrease  and we may incur a loss 
the revenue  cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks  we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending on the size of a project  these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year 
in general  turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations 
this is a result of the long term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts  whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract 
percentage of completion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in material adjustments that would adversely affect our operating results 
we recognize contract revenue using the percentage of completion method on long term fixed price contracts 
under this method  estimated contract revenue is accrued based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs  taking into consideration physical completion 
estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined 
accordingly  contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved  and adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised 
these estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience  and are only estimates 
variation of actual results from these assumptions or our historical experience could be material 
to the extent that these adjustments result in an increase  a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract revenue  we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings  which could be material 
terrorist attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations  our ability to raise capital or secure insurance  or our future growth 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action  including us military operations in iraq  will likely lead to continued volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our operations 
in addition  future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating both outside and inside the united states 
further  the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments may subject our operations to increased risks and  depending on their ultimate magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to a number of operational risks 
our business operations include pipeline construction  fabrication  pipeline rehabilitation services and construction and turnaround and maintenance services to refiners and petrochemical facilities 
these operations involve a high degree of operational risk 
natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  equipment and the environment  and suspension of operations 
in locations where we perform work with equipment that is owned by others  our continued use of the equipment can be subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage  loss of revenue  casualty loss  increased costs and significant liability to third parties 
the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 
an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable 
we may become liable for the obligations of our joint ventures and our subcontractors 
some of our projects are performed through joint ventures with other parties 
in addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work  where work is performed through a joint venture  we also have potential liability for the work performed by our joint ventures 
in these projects  even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget  we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of our joint ventures to perform or complete work in accordance with contract specifications 
we act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake 
in our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor  we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only such specialized activities as hazardous waste removal  nondestructive inspection and catering and security 
however  with respect to epc and other contracts  we may choose to subcontract a substantial portion of the project 
in the construction industry  the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  when acting as a prime contractor  we are subject to the risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
governmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
many aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate  including those relating to currency conversion and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and earnings of our personnel  the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers  including  in some jurisdictions  mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets 
in addition  we depend on the demand for our services from the oil  gas and power industries  and  therefore  our business is affected by changing taxes  price controls  and laws and regulations relating to the oil  gas and power industries generally 
the adoption of laws and regulations by the countries or the states in which we operate that are intended to curtail exploration and development drilling for oil and gas or the development of power generation facilities for economic and other policy reasons  could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services 
our operations are also subject to the risk of changes in laws and policies which may impose restrictions on our business  including trade restrictions  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
other types of governmental regulation which could  if enacted or implemented  adversely affect our operations include expropriation or nationalization decrees  confiscatory tax systems  primary or secondary boycotts directed at specific countries or companies  embargoes  extensive import restrictions or other trade barriers  mandatory sourcing and local participation rules  oil  gas or power price regulation  and unrealistically high labor rate and fuel price regulation 
our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in  or new interpretations of  existing regulations  and the impact of these changes could be material 
our strategic plan relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth 
acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 
our strategic plan involves growth through  among other things  the acquisition of other companies 
such growth involves a number of risks  including inherent difficulties relating to combining previously separate businesses  diversion of management s attention from ongoing day to day operations  the assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  including both foreseen and unforeseen liabilities  failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations  difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel  services and systems of an acquired business and to integrating marketing  contracting  commercial and other operational disciplines  and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
our operations expose us to potential environmental liabilities 
our us and candadian operations are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations which are complex and stringent 
we regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas  such as rivers  lakes and wetlands 
significant fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations  and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of releases of hazardous substances  rendering a person liable for environmental damage  without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
in addition to potential liabilities that may be incurred in satisfying these requirements  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others  or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed 
we own and operate several properties in the united states and canada that have been used for a number of years for the storage and maintenance of equipment and upon which hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released 
any release of substances by us or by third parties who previously operated on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  the resource compensation and recovery act rcra  and analogous state or local laws 
cercla imposes joint and several liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment  while rcra governs the generation  storage  transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes and clean up contaminated property 
this could have a significant impact on our future results 
our operations outside of the united states are oftentimes potentially subject to similar governmental or provincial controls and restrictions relating to the environment 
our industry is highly competitive  which could impede our growth 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
a substantial number of the major projects that we pursue are awarded based on bid proposals 
we compete for these projects against government owned or supported companies and other companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
in some markets  there is competition from national and regional firms against which we may not be able to compete on price 
our growth may be impacted to the extent that we are unable to successfully bid against these companies 
our operating results could be adversely affected if our non us operations became taxable in the united states 
if any income earned  currently or historically  by willbros group  inc or its non us subsidiaries from operations outside the united states constituted income effectively connected with a us trade or business  and as a result became taxable in the united states  our consolidated operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the services of our executive management 
our success depends heavily on the continued services of our executive management 
our management team is the nexus of our operational experience and customer relationships 
our ability to manage business risk and satisfy the expectations of our clients  stockholders and other stakeholders is dependent upon the collective experience and relationships of our management team 
in addition  we do not maintain key man life insurance for these individuals 
the loss or interruption of services provided by one or more of our senior officers could adversely affect our results of operations 
our goodwill may become impaired 
we have a substantial amount of goodwill following our acquisitions of inserv and midwest 
at least annually  we evaluate our goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of each operating unit 
this estimated fair value could change if there were future changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  capital expenditure levels or ability to perform at levels that were forecasted 
these changes could result in an impairment that would require a material non cash charge to our results of operations 
a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill 
sustained adverse equity market conditions and the resulting decline in market multiples and the company s stock price which in turn regarded as an indicator of an adverse change in the business climate  led to non cash  pre tax charge of  in the fourth quarter of the company will continue to monitor the carrying value of its goodwill 
risks related to our common stock our common stock  which is listed on the new york stock exchange  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are likely to continue in the future  and you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid by you 
the market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control  including the following the risk factors described in this item a  a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally  general conditions in our customers industries  and general conditions in the securities markets 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover  which may adversely affect the performance of our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  which may adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 
for example  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  which allows only one third of our directors to be elected each year  restrict the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors  and authorize our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise  either by us  a member of management or a major stockholder  or the perception that these sales could occur  may depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions  we may dilute share ownership 
we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
if we do issue additional equity securities  such issuances may have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders individual ownership percentages in our company 
our prior sale of common stock  warrants and convertible notes  and our outstanding warrants and convertible notes may lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding stock 
on november   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock 
in october  we sold  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of which  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock remained outstanding at december  
the recent issuance of warrants and the prior issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes and million of our senior convertible notes due the notes may cause a significant increase in the number of shares of common stock currently outstanding 
in may  we induced the conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes into a total of  shares of our common stock 
in addition  certain holders have exercised their right to convert the notes  converting approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes into  shares of our common stock as of december  as of december    shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and  shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
if we elect to induce the conversion of additional convertible notes or holders elect to convert additional convertible notes  there may be a significant increase in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding 
our authorized shares of common stock consist of million shares 
the issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would result in further dilution of the ownership interest in us held by existing stockholders 
we are authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  one million shares of preferred stock  which may give other stockholders dividend  conversion  voting and liquidation rights  among other rights  which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
while our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock  it reserves the right to do so in the future

our year end cash balance of  contributed to  of cash provided by continuing operating activities 
we achieved these successes as a result of building a new management team over the past two years  leveraging our acquisitions  and successfully executing on two large diameter cross country pipeline construction projects and one significant epc project in the us over the past two years  we have created  of stockholder s equity 
these accomplishments reinforce our commitment to deliver value to our stockholders as well as our customers 
our ceo  randy harl  joined willbros in january  followed shortly thereafter in august  by our cfo  van welch 
this was the starting point of enhancing the management team to make it more scalable as the company grew from revenue of  during to  during  over times the level 
after strengthening the company s financial position in late through a private equity offering of  and amending the existing credit facility  became a year of transition 
noteworthy transition events include the sale of the nigeria assets and operations in february  completing the negotiations leading to the final may settlement with the doj and sec  the acquisitions of midwest in july and inserv in november  and the creation of a more robust  less expensive credit facility in november 
the new management team was successful in removing uncertainties associated with past irregularities in nigeria and building a scalable foundation for growth in at the end of  backlog was at a record level of  in july  we acquired midwest to provide an entry point into the canada large diameter pipeline construction market 
during  the canada pipeline operations provided  of revenue and are positioned to take advantage of additional work in in november  we acquired inserv and formed a new downstream oil gas business segment 
downstream oil gas revenues were  downstream oil gas continues to perform as expected and is the catalyst for our shift to a company more focused on providing services 
in our legacy business  we had three significant projects in two cost reimbursable plus fixed fee contract types and one lump sum epc project 
the southeast supply header sesh project commenced in late as of december   total project revenue was   was recognized in another large diameter pipeline project  the midcontinent express project mep  contributed  of revenue in the guardian expansion and extension project guardian was our largest lump sum epc contract in  generating  of revenue with an appropriate risk adjusted margin 
our current challenge continuing to deliver value to our stockholders and our customers in will be very challenging 
we find ourselves in the midst of a significant economic dislocation  the impacts of which are already observable in severe commodity price declines 
oil traded at  an all time high in july as of february  oil was at  a decline from the high point 
the result has been a rapid decline in the north american rig counts and capital budget reductions by many e p  midstream  and downstream oil and gas companies 
the shrinking market will present new challenges and opportunities for us 
we are positioned to capitalize on the opportunities because of the organizational and process changes that we have made over the past two years 
early in the fourth quarter of  our engineering business segment began to experience the effects a reduction in market demand 
engineering has generally been a leading indicator of engineering and construction market changes 
as a result of engineering s fourth quarter decline  we took steps to right size our business segments and develop a strategy to realign our cost structure such that we could be responsive to our customers needs in a down cycle market 
we reduced annual engineering segment and corporate g a costs by  and  respectively 
a charge of approximately  was recorded as the cost of making these changes 
we continue to monitor  identify and take action on any non productive costs that would adversely impact our liquidity and ability to execute our development strategies 
however  our primary objective is to develop a cost structure that is compatible with our customers needs such that we can continue to develop our business in a different economic environment as compared to the past two years 
we have completed or are in the process of completing the following internally shifting people and assets among our business segments to address the shifting customer demands  working with our primary material suppliers and subcontractors to jointly develop a lower cost structure  identifying and reducing labor cost escalations that occurred as a result of the previous energy construction market imbalance where demand was exceeding supply  continuing to pursue our business strategy and leverage a strong balance sheet and cash position 
as of december   we have  of cash  cash equivalents  and  of capacity under our revolving loan facility 
this liquidity will allow us to continue our pursuit of o growing our pipeline manage and maintain service area  o expanding our downstream oil gas service offering in canada  o targeting risk adjusted opportunities in the middle east and north africa  and o increasing our government contracting focus 
we believe there will be opportunities in today s market for the companies who can respond quickly to their customers needs for a price point more consistent with the price of oil and gas in today s market 
our strategy we apply our core value system to everything we do  and those values provide the foundation for our strategy and execution 
our core values are safety  honesty integrity  our people  our customers  superior financial performance  vision innovation  and effective communication 
we work diligently to apply these values everyday and use them to guide us in the execution of our strategy 
we believe by allowing our values to drive the achievement of our strategic goals  we will increase stockholder value by leveraging our competitive strengths to focus on positioning ourselves for sustained long term earnings growth 
key elements of our strategy are as follows focus on managing risk we have implemented a core set of business conduct  practices and policies which have fundamentally improved our risk profile 
examples of our risk management execution include increasing our activity levels in lower risk countries  diversifying our service offerings and end markets  practicing rigorous financial management and limiting contract execution risk 
risk management is emphasized throughout all levels of the organization and covers all aspects of a project from strategic planning and bidding to contract management and financial reporting 
focus resources in markets with the highest risk adjusted return 
we believe north america continues to offer us highly attractive risk adjusted returns and the majority of our resources are focused on north america 
in spite of the current economic dislocation  we believe targeted areas in north america will provide significant opportunities 
more specifically  the monetization of previously developed oil and gas reserves requires connectivity to the end markets  and the ongoing development of unconventional shale gas plays is expected to provide new work in and beyond 
even though we are heavily concentrated in north america  we continue to seek international opportunities which can provide superior  more diversified risk adjusted returns and believe our extensive international experience is a competitive advantage 
we relocated our president of international operations to muscat  oman to expand our middle east operations into uae and saudi arabia 
additionally  we have opened an office in libya 
we believe that markets in north africa and the middle east  may offer attractive opportunities for us in the future given mid and long term industry trends 
maintain a conservative contract portfolio 
while we will continue to pursue a balanced contract portfolio  current market dynamics suggest we may be entering a period of increased fixed price contracting opportunities 
we believe our fixed price execution experience  our current efforts to realign our cost structure to the rapidly changing market  our improved systems  and focus on risk management  provide us a competitive advantage versus many of our competitors 
leverage industry position and reputation into a broader service offering we believe the global energy infrastructure market will continue to provide opportunities 
the challenge will be to identify and focus on the critical few projects with a high probability of moving forward in the near term 
we believe our core capabilities can be expanded beyond our current offerings and markets  and we are selectively evaluating these prospects 
our established platform and track record position us to expand our expertise into a broader range of related service offerings 
we intend to leverage our project management  engineering and construction skills to establish additional service offerings  such as instrumentation and electrical services  turbo machinery services  environmental services and pipeline system integrity services 
we believe that over time  a more balanced mix of recurring services  such as program management and maintenance services  and capital projects will enhance the earnings profile of our business 
additionally  we intend to pursue selective strategic acquisitions to complement our organic expansion strategies and to minimize our dependence on the cyclical large diameter cross country pipeline construction market 
we began this process in with the inserv and midwest acquisitions that expanded our service offerings as well as the geographies where we deliver those services 
our november acquisition of inserv complemented our service offerings in the midstream market 
our july acquisition of midwest significantly enhanced our presence in mainline pipeline construction in western canada 
we believe that companies with strong balance sheets and liquidity positions will have opportunities to acquire assets and companies in today s uncertain market 
maintain financial flexibility maintaining the financial flexibility to meet the material  equipment and personnel needs to support our project commitments  as well as the ability to pursue our expansion and diversification objectives is critical to our growth 
we view financial strength and flexibility as a fundamental requirement to fulfilling our strategy 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and borrowing capacity of  comprised of cash and cash equivalents of  and unutilized cash borrowing capacity of  under our revolving credit facility to address our current capital requirements with no short term borrowings or commercial paper outstanding 
for the year ended december   we increased our working capital position  for continuing operations  by  percent to  from  at december  in addition  our  senior secured revolving credit facility the credit facility provides us additional financial flexibility in the form of  in cash borrowing capacity to pursue our growth strategy 
the combination of our strong cash position  the borrowing availability under our existing credit facility  and our future cash flow from operations will allow us to focus on the highest return projects available during uncertain economic times as well as pursue our strategy of diversification as opportunities present themselves 
the limited availability of credit in the market has not affected our credit facility  nor do we believe that it will impact our ability to access surety bonding in the future 
leverage core service expertise into additional full epc contracts our core expertise and service offerings allow us to provide our customers with a single source epc solution which creates greater efficiencies to the benefit of both our customers and our company 
as one of the few pipeline constructors with engineering capabilities  we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide this integrated service to our customers 
in performing integrated epc contracts  we establish ourselves as overall project managers from the earliest stages of project inception and are therefore better able to efficiently determine the design  permitting  procurement and construction sequence for a project in connection with making engineering decisions 
our customers benefit from a more seamless execution  while for us  these contracts often yield higher profit margins on the engineering and construction components of the contract compared to stand alone contracts for similar services 
additionally  this contract structure allows us to deploy our resources more efficiently and capture the engineering  procurement and construction components of these projects 
significant business developments in  we made significant progress to further position willbros as a leader in the engineering and construction industry  and continue to do so 
a recap of recent initiatives include the following the quality of our execution on one of our largest pipeline construction projects in canada has positioned us to negotiate potential additional work with this customer 
additionally in canada we are leveraging our strong in country presence in combination with our downstream oil and gas capabilities to more actively pursue downstream oil and gas opportunities  including above ground storage tanks and process heaters 
we have added experienced senior operating and business development resources to our pipeline manage and maintain business and restructured the group to increase coordination amongst our engineering  program management and construction capabilities to provide our customers a more integrated service solution 
our efforts to pursue new business in the middle east and north africa are expected to result in the award of our first contract in libya 
we significantly increased our ability to pursue and execute government contracts with the addition of more operating level leadership and greater cross utilization of our existing construction and program management capabilities 
while individually these business initiatives were relatively modest contributors to our results  we believe that the groundwork is in place for each of these expanded service lines to enhance our future performance 
in addition to putting in place important capabilities to expand and support growth  we also made substantial progress towards operational and financial improvements to our business model  preparing us for the challenges of the current market environment 
we have worked diligently to stay ahead of the curve  staying focused on important process and system improvements designed to keep the business best positioned for prevailing market conditions 
these actions include improving our strategic planning process to better align our resources with both current opportunities and long term growth objectives  redirecting our sales process to most efficiently target the right customers with the right opportunities for willbros to deliver integrated solutions  which we believe offer our customers superior value  investing in system and process improvements to increase the value we deliver to our customers including o delivering lower costs through improved procurement processes and procedures  o reinforcing our project execution skills  particularly as we begin to see a shift toward more fixed price contracts  reduced our effective tax rate to  and initiating the reorganization of the company from a panama holding company structure to a delaware holding company structure which was approved by the stockholders on february  significant subsequent project awards during the first quarter of we have been awarded two significant projects that will add approximately  to our backlog 
the texas independence pipeline tips is approximately miles of pipeline and construction and will commence in early march 
in addition to tips  we have verbal commitment and are in the final negotiations with ncra to extend our current contract for program management services associated with portions of the planned heavy crude expansion project and related major capital projects for ncra in mcpherson  kansas 
goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge totaling  for our downstream oil gas segment for the impairment of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we performed our required annual impairment test for goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis supported by comparative market multiples to determine the fair values of our businesses versus their book values 
the test indicated that the book value for downstream oil gas goodwill exceeded its fair value 
the impairment charge was primarily driven by sustained adverse conditions in the equity markets  which negatively impacted the market capitalization of almost all public companies  including our own  and is in turn  regarded as an indicator of an adverse change in the business climate 
our stock reached a low of per share in the fourth quarter of as compared to a high of in the preceding quarter  a decrease 
the charge reduces goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of inserv in november and does not impact the company s business operations 
we believe this impairment does not represent a decrease in the operational value of our downstream oil gas segment 
excluding the goodwill impairment  downstream oil gas s operational and financial performance has met or exceeded our pre acquisition expectations  and we expect this to be the case in and beyond 
downstream oil gas continues to allow us to provide a more diverse service offering and reduces our dependence on large diameter cross country pipeline construction activity
