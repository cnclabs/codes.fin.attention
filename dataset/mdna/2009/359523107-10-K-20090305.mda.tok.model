item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background fuel tech  inc fuel tech has two broad technology segments that provide advanced engineering solutions to meet the pollution control  efficiency improvement and operational optimization needs of energy related facilities worldwide 
they are as follows air pollution control technologies the air pollution control technology segment focuses primarily on nitrogen oxide nox emission reductions in flue gas from boilers  incinerators  furnaces and other stationary combustion sources and includes the noxout  noxout cascade  gsg  noxout ultra and noxout scr processes 
fuel tech distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
fuel chem technologies the fuel chem technology segment uses chemical processes  including tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  to control slagging  fouling and corrosion  as well as the formation of sulfur trioxide  ammonium bisulfate  particulate matter pm  carbon dioxide  nox and unburned carbon in fly ash in furnaces and boilers 
fuel tech sells its fuel chem program through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
at december   fuel chem programs were operating on over combustion units around the world  treating a wide variety of solid and liquid fuels  including coal  heavy oil  biomass and municipal waste 
the fuel chem program improves the efficiency  reliability and environmental status of plants operating in the electric utility  industrial  pulp and paper  waste to energy  university and district heating markets and offers numerous operational  financial and environmental benefits to owners of boilers  furnaces and other combustion units 
the key market dynamic for both technology segments is the continued use of fossil fuels  especially coal  as the principal fuel source for global electricity production 
coal accounts for approximately of all us electricity generation 
coal s share of global electricity generation is forecast to be approximately by major coal consumers include china  the united states and india 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are deemed critical 
we routinely discuss our critical accounting policies with the company s audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues from the sales of chemical products are recorded when title transfers  either at the point of shipment or at the point of destination  depending on the contract with the customer 
fuel tech uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for equipment construction and license contracts that are sold within the air pollution control technology segment 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual construction costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
revisions in completion estimates and contract values in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revisions become known can influence the timing of when revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
provisions are made for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
as of december  and december   fuel tech had no construction contracts in progress that were identified as loss contracts 
fuel tech s apc contracts are typically six to twelve months in length 
a typical contract will have three or four critical operational measurements that  when achieved  serve as the basis for us to invoice the customer via progress billings 
at a minimum  these measurements will include the generation of engineering drawings  the shipment of equipment and the completion of a system performance test 
as part of most of its contractual project agreements  fuel tech will agree to customer specific acceptance criteria that relate to the operational performance of the system that is being sold 
these criteria are determined based on mathematical modeling that is performed by fuel tech personnel  which is based on operational inputs that are provided by the customer 
the customer will warrant that these operational inputs are accurate as they are specified in the binding contractual agreement 
further  the customer is solely responsible for the accuracy of the operating condition information  all performance guarantees and equipment warranties granted by us are void if the operating condition information is inaccurate or is not met 
accounts receivable includes unbilled receivables  representing revenues recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
at december  and december   unbilled receivables were approximately  and  respectively 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts were  and at december  and december   respectively 
such amounts are included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
fuel tech has installed over units with the technology and has never failed to meet a performance guarantee when the customer has provided the required operating conditions for the project 
as part of the project implementation process  we perform system start up and optimization services that effectively serve as a test of actual project performance 
we believe that this test  combined with the accuracy of the modeling that is performed  enables revenue to be recognized prior to the receipt of formal customer acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts in order to control and monitor the credit risk associated with our customer base  we review the credit worthiness of customers on a recurring basis 
factors influencing the level of scrutiny include the level of business the customer has with fuel tech  the customer s payment history and the customer s financial stability 
representatives of our management team review all past due accounts on a weekly basis to assess collectibility 
at the end of each reporting period  the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is reviewed relative to management s collectibility assessment and is adjusted if deemed necessary 
our historical credit loss has been insignificant 
assessment of potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets effective january   fuel tech adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under the guidance of this statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but rather are required to be reviewed annually or more frequently if indicators arise  for impairment 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the carrying value 
fuel tech uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to determine the current fair value of its two reporting units 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce and working capital changes 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
fuel tech reviews other intangible assets  which include customer lists and relationships  covenants not to compete  patent assets and acquired technologies  for impairment on a recurring basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates of future cash flows are made  however  the actual cash values that could be realized may differ from those that are estimated 
based upon the nature of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded on the balance sheets as of december  and  the company believes that  in order for an impairment to occur  a series of material prolonged negative economic events would have to occur 
these events would most likely be seen in economic indicators such as suppressed consolidated revenues or common stock price  reduced cash flows or declining apc order backlog 
valuation allowance for deferred income taxes deferred tax assets represent deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at the end of each reporting period  fuel tech reviews the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
as part of this review  we consider if there are taxable temporary differences that could generate taxable income in the future  if there is the ability to carry back the net operating losses or credits  if there is a projection of future taxable income  and if there are any tax planning strategies that can be readily implemented 
stock based compensation fuel tech recognizes compensation expense for employee equity awards ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of awards 
determining the fair value of stock options using the black scholes model requires judgment  including estimates for risk free interest rate an estimate based on the yield of zero coupon treasury securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option  expected volatility an estimate based on the historical volatility of fuel tech s common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the option  and expected life of the option an estimate based on historical experience including the effect of employee terminations 
if any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual  stock based compensation expense could be impacted

versus revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the year over year increase of  or  was driven by a increase in revenues from the fuel chem technology segment that were largely offset by a modest revenue decline in the apc technology segment 
revenues for the apc technology segment were  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  versus the global financial crisis and the vacatur of the clean air interstate rule cair in july subsequently remanded in december had a negative effect on segment revenues and apc order backlog 
this segment is well positioned to capitalize on cair the next phase of increasingly stringent us air quality standards which is effective january   and the clean air visibility rule cavr  which is effective january  thousands of utility and industrial boilers will be impacted by these regulations and fuel tech s technologies will serve as an important element in enabling utility and industrial boiler unit owners to attain compliance 
during  fuel tech announced new contracts valued at approximately  revenues for the fuel chem technology segment were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  versus this segment s growth is indicative of the continued market acceptance of fuel tech s patented tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  particularly on coal fired units  which represent the largest market opportunity for the technology  both domestically and abroad 
during  fuel tech added new units to its customer base  of which were coal fired units  the largest annual total in the company s history 
historically  most demonstrations convert into commercial accounts 
cost of sales for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the cost of sales percentage for the apc technology segment increased to from in the increase is attributable to the mix of project business 
the cost of sales percentage for the fuel chem technology segment increased to in from in the increase is due to costs associated with demonstration periods and other related start up activities for the record number of incremental units noted above  especially for the demonstrations in india and china where the company bore a significantly higher portion of the costs versus typical demonstrations in the united states 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the  increase over is principally attributable to the following fuel tech recorded  in stock compensation expense in in accordance with sfas r  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this amount represented a  increase over  attributable to stock option awards to directors and certain fuel tech employees in and the on going expense recognition related to stock options awarded in prior years 
fuel tech invested approximately  in personnel and other costs  including expenses associated with the start up of the company s beijing  china office  in the areas of engineering  sales  marketing and administration to ensure the company s financial and operational infrastructure are able to accommodate anticipated future growth 
partially offsetting this unfavorable variance was a reduction in annual incentive expenses of  as the minimum income threshold for the year ended december  was not met and  thus  no bonus payments were made under the company s incentive plan 
research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel tech has established a more focused approach in the pursuit of commercial applications for its technologies outside of its traditional markets  and in the development and analysis of new technologies that could represent incremental market opportunities 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased by versus due to decreases in the interest rates paid by institutions with whom the company s investments were located 
further  fuel tech recorded interest expense of in related specifically to a short term credit facility that was used to support the start up of fuel tech s office in beijing  china 
finally  the change in other income expense is due largely to the impact of foreign exchange rates related to balances denominated in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   fuel tech recorded tax expense of  for the year ended december   fuel tech recorded tax expense of  that predominantly represented deferred tax expense related to taxable income recognized in versus revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the year over year increase of  or  predominantly reflects moderate increases in both technology segments 
revenues for the apc technology segment were  for the year ended december   an increase of   or  versus this segment is positioned well to capitalize on the next phase of increasingly stringent us air quality standards 
with the compliance for the epa s sip call regulation beginning to wind down  utilities and industrial facilities across the country are planning for compliance with the clean air interstate rule cair and the clean air visibility rule cavr  which take effect in and  respectively 
thousands of utility and industrial boilers will be impacted by these regulations and fuel tech s technologies will serve as an important element in enabling utility and industrial boiler unit owners to attain compliance 
in  fuel tech announced new contracts valued at million  which exceeded the previous annual record by almost 
revenues for the fuel chem technology segment were  in  an increase of  or  over this segment s growth is indicative of the continued market acceptance of fuel tech s patented tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  particularly on coal fired units  which represent the largest market opportunity for the technology  both domestically and abroad 
in  fuel tech added new coal fired units to its customer base  the largest annual total in the company s history 
cost of sales for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the cost of sales percentage for for the apc technology segment decreased to from in the decrease is attributable to the mix of project business 
for the fuel chem technology segment  the cost of sales percentage increased to in from in the increase is due to start up costs related to the incremental units noted above  without the realization of related revenues as only two of the new units contributed significant revenues during due to customer related delays impacting the timing of startup 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the  increase over is principally attributable to the following fuel tech recorded  in stock compensation expense in in accordance with statement r  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this amount represented a  increase over attributable to the awarding of stock options to all fuel tech employees in december and to an increase in the fair value of the options granted  which was driven by an increase in the price of fuel tech s common stock 
partially offsetting this unfavorable variance was a reduction in revenue related expenses of  as fuel tech aligned the focus of all employees under a common incentive plan in research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel tech has established a more focused approach in the pursuit of commercial applications for its technologies outside of its traditional markets  and in the development and analysis of new technologies that could represent incremental market opportunities 
interest income increased by over reflecting higher average cash and short term investment balances 
further  fuel tech recorded interest expense of in related specifically to a short term credit facility that was used to support the start up of fuel tech s new office in beijing  china 
finally  the moderate increase in other income is due largely to foreign exchange gains related to balances denominated in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   fuel tech recorded tax expense of  which predominantly represents deferred tax expense related to taxable income recognized in for the year ended december   fuel tech recorded tax expense of  also representing deferred tax expense related to taxable income 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   fuel tech had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  and working capital of  versus  and  at december   respectively 
operating activities provided  of cash for the year ended december   primarily due to the favorable operating results of the business segments 
investing activities used cash of  for the year ended december   primarily for expenditures related to our new corporate headquarters building to support and enhance the operations of the business of  the acquisition funding for substantially all of the assets of tackticks  llc and flowtack  llc of  and the remainder used principally for equipment related to the fuel chem technology segment 
capital expenditures  which typically consist of equipment related to fuel chem demonstration programs or commercial installations  are expected to be funded primarily from cash flows from operations 
other than the outfitting of the new corporate headquarters building in  the company has historically incurred a nominal amount of maintenance capital expenditures 
fuel tech generated cash from financing activities in the amount of  of this amount  represents proceeds derived from the exercise price of options and warrants exercised in  while represents the excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options in fuel tech has a domestic million revolving credit facility expiring july  the facility is unsecured and bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points 
fuel tech can use this facility for cash advances and standby letters of credit 
at december   the company had outstanding standby letters of credit and bank guarantees  predominantly to customers  totaling approximately  in connection with contracts in process 
fuel tech is committed to reimbursing the issuing bank for any payments made by the bank under these instruments 
at december   there were no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately  was available 
management has met with the company s lending institutions and  during the course of those meetings  was not made aware of any information indicating that they will not be able to perform their obligations for any letters of credit or guarantees issued  nor be unable to supply funds to fuel tech if the company chooses to borrow funds under its two revolving credit facilities
