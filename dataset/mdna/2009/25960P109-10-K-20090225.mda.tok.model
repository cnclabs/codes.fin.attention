acquisitions  dispositions  repositionings and financings 
acquisitions 
during  we completed the following acquisition transactions in march  we acquired a million square foot office portfolio consisting of six class a buildings  all located in our core los angeles submarkets santa monica  beverly hills  sherman oaks encino and warner center woodland hills for a contract price of approximately million 
as described below  we have contributed these six properties to fund x 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
in february  we acquired a two thirds interest in a  square foot office building located in honolulu  hawaii 
as part of the same transaction  we also acquired all of the assets of the honolulu club  a private membership athletic and social club  which is located in the building 
the aggregate contract price was approximately million and the purchase was made through a consolidated joint venture with our local partner 
in may  the operations of the athletic club were sold to a third party for a nominal cost 
simultaneously  the acquirer leased from us the space occupied by the athletic club 
the results of operations and loss on sale of the assets of the athletic club were not material 
in december  we acquired the five sixths that we did not already own of the fee title to the land underlying one of our existing office properties in the westwood submarket  for a fixed contract price of million 
with the completion of this acquisition  we now own of the fee interest and of the leasehold interest 
repositionings 
we generally select a property for repositioning at the time we purchase it 
we often strategically purchase properties with large vacancies or expected near term lease roll over and use our knowledge of the property and submarket to determine the optimal use and tenant mix 
a repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property 
a repositioning may involve a complete structural renovation of a building to significantly upgrade the character of the property  or it may involve targeted remodeling of common areas and tenant spaces to make the property more attractive to certain identified tenants 
because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property  tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket  the results are varying degrees of depressed rental revenue and occupancy levels for the affected property  which impacts our results and  accordingly  comparisons of our performance from period to period 
the repositioning process generally occurs over the course of months or even years 
during  we had on going repositioning efforts on three of our office properties representing buildings and approximately million rentable square feet 
repositioning properties exclude acquisition properties where the plan for improvement is implemented as part of the acquisition 
financings 
during  we completed the following financing transactions in october  we completed the initial closing of million of equity commitments for our newly formed institutional fund  douglas emmett fund x  llc  of which we committed million 
in connection with the initial closing  we contributed to fund x the six office properties which we acquired in march as well as the related million loan 
fund x contemplates a fund raising period until july and an investment period of up to four years from the initial closing  followed by a ten year value creation period 
with limited exceptions  fund x will be our exclusive investment vehicle during its investment period  using the same underwriting and leverage principles and focusing primarily on the same markets as we have 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
in august  we obtained a non recourse million term loan secured by the six property portfolio that we acquired in march as described above and in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
this loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to one month libor plus basis points  however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fix the interest at based on an actual day basis until september  this loan facility matures on august  this long term loan replaces the million bridge loan obtained in march in connection with the property acquisition 
in march  we obtained a non recourse million term loan secured by four of our previously unencumbered office properties 
this loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to one month libor plus basis points  however we have entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fix the interest rate at based on an actual day basis until january  this loan facility matures on april  proceeds from this loan were utilized to repay our secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
in february  the joint venture in which we have a two thirds interest obtained an million loan that financed our february acquisition described above and in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
this loan has an interest rate of one month libor plus basis points and a two year term with a one year extension 
basis of presentation for the periods subsequent to october   the financial statements presented are the consolidated financial statements of douglas emmett  inc and its subsidiaries including our operating partnership 
douglas emmett  inc did not have any meaningful operating activity until the consummation of our ipo and the related acquisition of our predecessor and certain other entities in october for a detailed description of this transaction and our resulting organization  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the financial statements for the periods prior to october  are the consolidated financial statements of our predecessor 
they include the accounts of dera and certain institutional funds  but do not include the accounts of other entities which were acquired at the time of our ipo 
because the period reflects significant differences in the ongoing economic impact resulting from our ipo formation transactions  the results are in many cases not directly comparable to or and we urge readers to be even more than usually cautious in using them to predict future results 
as a result of these facts  investors are urged to exercise caution in using these past results as an indicator for our future performance 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations of douglas emmett  inc and our predecessor are based upon their respective consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates of certain items and judgments as to certain future events  for example with respect to the allocation of the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings  improvements  equipment  and any related intangible assets and liabilities  or the effect of a property tax reassessment of our properties in connection with the ipo 
these determinations  even though inherently subjective and subject to change  affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
while we believe that our estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and judgments at the time they are made  some of our assumptions  estimates and judgments will inevitably prove to be incorrect 
as a result  actual outcomes will likely differ from our accruals  and those differences positive or negative could be material 
some of our accruals are subject to adjustment as we believe appropriate based on revised estimates and reconciliation to the actual results when available 
investment in real estate 
acquisitions of properties and other business combinations are accounted for utilizing the purchase method and  accordingly  the results of operations of acquired properties are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land  buildings and improvements  equipment and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in place at market leases  acquired above and below market leases and tenant relationships 
initial valuations are subject to change until such information is finalized no later than months from the acquisition date 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment  and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount 
if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases 
the fair values of tangible assets are determined on an as if vacant basis 
the as if vacant fair value is allocated to land  where applicable  buildings  tenant improvements and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property 
the estimated fair value of acquired in place at market leases are the costs we would have incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition 
such estimates include the fair value of leasing commissions and legal costs that would be incurred to lease the property to this occupancy level 
additionally  we evaluate the time period over which such occupancy level would be achieved and we include an estimate of the net operating costs primarily real estate taxes  insurance and utilities incurred during the lease up period  which is generally six months 
above market and below market in place lease values are recorded as an asset or liability based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received or paid pursuant to the in place tenant or ground leases  respectively  and our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed to operations as incurred 
significant betterments are capitalized 
interest  insurance and property tax costs incurred during the period of construction of real estate facilities are capitalized 
when assets are sold or retired  their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period 
the values allocated to land  buildings  site improvements  tenant improvements  and in place leases are depreciated on a straight line basis using an estimated life of years for buildings  years for site improvements  a portfolio average term of existing leases for in place lease values and the respective remaining lease terms for tenant improvements and leasing costs 
the values of above and below market tenant leases are amortized over the remaining life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market tenant leases or a decrease for above market tenant leases to rental income 
the value of above and below market ground leases are amortized over the remaining life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market ground leases or a decrease for above market ground leases to office rental operating expense 
the amortization of acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
income taxes 
as a reit  we are permitted to deduct distributions paid to its stockholders  eliminating the federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the corporate level 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
revenue recognition 
revenue and gain is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
of the securities and exchange commission  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all leases are classified as operating leases 
for all lease terms exceeding one year  rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
deferred rent receivables represent rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis in excess of billed rents 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
in addition  we record a capital asset for leasehold improvements constructed by us that are reimbursed by tenants  with the offsetting side of this accounting entry recorded to deferred revenue which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the deferred revenue is amortized as additional rental revenue over the life of the related lease 
rental revenue from month to month leases or leases with no scheduled rent increases or other adjustments is recognized on a monthly basis when earned 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes  common area maintenance and other recoverable costs are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees  which are included in rental income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
we recognize gains on sales of real estate pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate fas 
the specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in fas related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  profit sharing or leasing method 
if the sales criteria have been met  we further analyze whether profit recognition is appropriate using the full accrual method 
if the criteria to recognize profit using the full accrual method have not been met  we defer the gain and recognize it when the criteria are met or use the installment or cost recovery method as appropriate under the circumstances 
monitoring of rents and other receivables 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance  we may recognize bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent 
we generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants  other than security deposits or letters of credit 
if our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
stock based compensation 
we have awarded stock based compensation to certain key employees and members of our board of directors in the form of stock options and long term incentive plan units ltip units 
these awards are accounted for under fas no 
r revised  share based payment fas r  which was effective beginning january  we had no stock based compensation awards outstanding prior to our ipo in october this pronouncement requires that we estimate the fair value of the awards and recognize this value over the requisite vesting period 
we utilize a black scholes model to calculate the fair value of options  which uses assumptions related to the stock  including volatility and dividend yield  as well as assumptions related to the stock award itself  such as the expected term and estimated forfeiture rate 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions for which we have relied on observations of both historical trends and implied estimates as determined by independent third parties 
for ltip units  the fair value is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant and a discount for post vesting restrictions estimated by a third party consultant 
financial instruments 
the estimated fair values of financial instruments are determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methods 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
accordingly  estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in current market exchanges 
interest rate agreements 
we manage our interest rate risk associated with borrowings by obtaining interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts 
no other derivative instruments are used 
we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income  which is a component of our stockholders equity account 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
results of operations the comparability of our results of operations between  and is affected by our acquisition and repositioning activities in all years presented 
this includes the acquisition of four office properties  three multifamily properties and the fee interest in one parcel of land that we lease to a third party under a long term ground lease that we acquired from our non predecessor entities at the time of our ipo 
this also includes nine office properties  one multifamily property and the remaining fee interest in one parcel of land that we acquired from unaffiliated entities subsequent to our ipo 
as a consequence  our results are not comparable from period to period due to the varying timing of individual property acquisitions  the impact of the ipo formation transactions and lease up or increased vacancy resulting from repositioning activities 
our repositioning efforts have also impacted our operating results  and we expect that to continue 
in our office portfolio  our repositioning properties include warner center towers  the trillium and bishop place for all periods presented 
in addition  harbor court  sherman oaks galleria and wilshire were repositioning properties in our acquisition properties in our office portfolio include brentwood court  brentwood medical plaza  brentwood san vicente medical and san vicente plaza  which were acquired at the time of our ipo  as well as century park west and cornerstone plaza  which were acquired in during  we acquired the honolulu club and a portfolio of six properties as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
as of december   the repositioning and acquisition properties represented of our total office portfolio based on rentable square feet 
in addition  during the three years we acquired four properties in our multifamily portfolio royal kunia in march and barrington kiowa  barry and kiowa at the time of our ipo 
as of december   our multifamily acquisitions represented of the total units in our multifamily portfolio 
during the periods discussed  we had no multifamily repositioning properties 
as discussed under basis of presentation  our results of operations for contain the consolidated results of douglas emmett  inc and its subsidiaries  including our operating partnership  for the period from october  through december  the results of operations for the period january  through october  consist of our predecessor  which includes the accounts of dera and the institutional funds

total office revenue consists of rental revenue  tenant recoveries and parking and other income 
total office portfolio revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for for the reasons described below 
rental revenue 
rental revenue includes rental revenues from our office properties  percentage rent on the retail space contained within office properties  and lease termination income 
total office rental revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase is due to million of incremental rent from the nine properties we acquired subsequent to the beginning of  as well as increases in average rental rates for new and renewal leases across our existing office portfolio 
parking and other income 
total office parking and other income increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily due to incremental revenues of million from the nine properties we acquired subsequent to the beginning of  as well as increases in parking rates implemented across the portfolio and increases in ground rent income 
multifamily revenue total multifamily revenue 
total multifamily revenue consists of rent  parking income and other income 
total multifamily revenue decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease is primarily due to million in amortization of below market leases for certain multifamily units initially recorded at the time of our ipo and formation that were fully amortized during the second quarter of  thus causing a decline when comparing to this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million resulting from increased occupancy and an increase in rents charged to both new and existing tenants  including increases for select santa monica multifamily units 
these units were under leases signed prior to a change in california law that allows landlords to reset rents to market rates when a tenant moves out 
therefore  a portion of the multifamily increase was due to the rollover to market rents of several of these rent controlled units  or pre units  since january  operating expenses office rental expenses 
total office rental expenses increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily due to million of incremental operating expenses from the nine properties we acquired subsequent to the beginning of the increase was offset by a net reduction in various operating expenses in our existing portfolio  consisting primarily of lower property tax accruals offset by higher utility expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to incremental depreciation and amortization of million from the nine properties we acquired subsequent to the beginning of  as well as the finalization of the purchase price allocation and related lives of real estate assets combined at the time of our ipo formation transactions

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue office revenue total office revenue 
total office revenue consists of rental revenue  tenant recoveries and parking and other income 
total office portfolio revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for for the reasons described below 
rental revenue 
rental revenue includes rental revenues from our office properties  percentage rent on the retail space contained within office properties  and lease termination income 
total office rental revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for this increase is primarily due to incremental rent from the four properties we acquired at the time of our ipo in october  the two additional properties we acquired in the second and fourth quarters of as described above  and gains in occupancy at our repositioning properties 
rent also increased for the remainder of our office portfolio that was not acquired or repositioned during the periods presented  primarily due to gains in occupancy and increases in average rental rates for new and renewal leases signed since january  in addition  we recognized approximately million of incremental rent related to the amortization of net below market rents that resulted from the mark to market adjustments to our leases that we recorded in connection with our ipo 
tenant recoveries 
total office tenant recoveries increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for primarily due to incremental recoveries from the four properties acquired in the fourth quarter of  and the two additional properties we acquired in the overall increase is also attributable to increases in tenant recoveries at our repositioning properties resulting from increases in occupancy  as well as an increase in recoverable scheduled services  payroll expense and property taxes as described in office rental expenses below 
parking and other income 
total office parking and other income increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to gains in occupancy in our repositioning and acquisition properties and parking rate increases implemented in july and july across the portfolio 
multifamily revenue total multifamily revenue 
total multifamily revenue consists of rent  parking income and other income 
total multifamily revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for  primarily due to the three multifamily property acquisitions in our ipo formation transactions  as well as villas at royal kunia  which we acquired in march in addition  a significant number of our santa monica multifamily units were under leases signed prior to a change in california law that allows landlords to reset rents to market rates when a tenant moves out 
a portion of the multifamily increase was due to the rollover to market rents of several of these rent controlled units  or pre units  since january  the remainder of the increase was primarily due to increases in rents charged to other existing and new tenants 
in addition  we recognized approximately million of incremental rent related to the amortization of net below market rents that resulted from the mark to market adjustments to our leases that we recorded in connection with our ipo 
operating expenses office rental expenses 
total office rental expense increased million  or  to million for compared to for expenses increased due to higher levels of scheduled services  payroll expense and property tax expense  reflecting both additional properties acquired at and after our ipo  as well as higher costs at existing properties between comparative periods 
the increased expense was offset by lower operating expenses in that resulted from the elimination of fees for property management services  which were provided by douglas  emmett and company deco in prior to the acquisition and consolidation of deco in the ipo formation transactions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for decreased million to million for  compared to million for the level of general and administrative expenses for was primarily attributable to one time non cash compensation costs at the time of our ipo totaling approximately million and the payment by our predecessor of million in one time discretionary cash bonuses prior to the consummation of our ipo 
there were no such costs during  however  these savings were partially offset by publicly traded reit related costs subsequent to our ipo  including legal and audit fees  directors and officers insurance and costs related to our compliance with section of sarbanes oxley 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to depreciation of the higher cost basis for each existing property in our portfolio as a result of recording these real estate assets at market value in connection with our ipo and formation transactions  as well as incremental depreciation related to the ten office and multifamily properties we acquired as described above 
non operating income and expenses gain on investments in interest rate contracts  net 
we recognized a net gain of million on investments in interest rate contracts in due to changes in the fair market value of our in place interest rate swap contracts during the ten month period of prior to our ipo formation transactions 
in conjunction with our ipo  we entered into a series of interest rate swaps that effectively offset any future changes in the fair value of our predecessor s existing interest rate contracts 
therefore  no comparable gain or loss was recognized during interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding debt related to the million borrowed in the fourth quarter of to fund a portion of the formation transactions related to our ipo and an additional million borrowed during the second quarter of to fund repurchase of our equity and the purchase of our new property in century city 
the remaining increase in interest expense was primarily due to borrowings outstanding under our corporate revolver during to fund additional repurchases of our equity and the purchase of our new property in the olympic corridor 
deficit distributions to minority partners  net 
deficit distributions to minority partners  net  was a million net distribution for the expense was primarily due to cash distributions to limited partners exceeding the carrying amount of minority interest in the institutional funds included in our predecessor 
this category was not applicable subsequent to our ipo and therefore no such amount was recorded in minority interests 
minority interest income totaling million was recognized for compared to minority expense of million expense for the amount in represents the limited partners ownership interest in our predecessor  including a preferred minority investor 
the amount in represents the portion of results attributable to minority ownership interests in our operating partnership 
liquidity and capital resources available borrowings  cash balances and capital resources in october  we completed the initial closing of fund x 
as of the date of its initial closing  fund x had obtained equity commitments totaling million  of which we committed million and certain of our officers committed million on the same terms as the other investors 
fund x contemplates a fund raising period until july and an investment period of up to four years from the initial closing  followed by a ten year value creation period 
with limited exceptions  fund x will be our exclusive investment vehicle during its investment period  using the same underwriting and leverage principles and focusing primarily on the same markets as we have 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further description of the acquisition and note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further description of the debt 
we had total indebtedness of billion at december   excluding a loan premium representing the mark to market adjustment on variable rate debt assumed from our predecessor 
our debt increased million from december  primarily as a result of acquisitions as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further description of the debt 
we have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks led by bank of america  na and banc of america securities llc totaling million 
at december   there was approximately million available to us under this credit facility 
this revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to either libor plus basis points or federal funds rate plus basis points if the amount outstanding is million or less 
however  if the amount outstanding is greater than million  the credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to either libor plus basis points or federal funds rate plus basis points the facility is scheduled to mature on october  but has two one year extensions available to us 
in the current economic environment and credit market  there is a chance that we may not meet the criteria necessary to utilize the extensions  or the availability under the facility may be reduced upon extension 
we have used our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes  including acquisition funding  redevelopment and repositioning opportunities  tenant improvements and capital expenditures  share equivalent repurchases  recapitalizations and working capital 
we have historically financed our capital needs through short term lines of credit and long term secured mortgages of which have been at floating rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in short term interest rates on our cash flow from operations  we generally enter into interest rate swap or interest rate cap agreements 
at december   of our debt was effectively fixed at an overall rate of on an actual day basis by virtue of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements in place at the end of the reporting period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
at december   our total borrowings under secured loans represented of our total market capitalization of billion 
total market capitalization includes our consolidated debt and the value of common stock and operating partnership units each based on our common stock closing price at december  on the new york stock exchange of per share 
the nature of our business  and the requirements imposed by reit rules that we distribute a substantial majority of our income on an annual basis  will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term 
in we declared an annual dividend of per share  paid quarterly following the end of each quarter 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through cash provided by operations and  if necessary  by drawing upon our senior secured revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that cash provided by operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions  redevelopment and repositioning of properties  non recurring capital expenditures  and repayment of indebtedness at maturity 
we do not expect that we will have sufficient funds on hand to cover all of these long term cash requirements 
we will seek to satisfy these needs through cash flow from commitments to fund x  operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of debt and equity securities  including units in our operating partnership  property dispositions and joint venture transactions 
we have historically financed our operations  acquisitions and development  through the use of our revolving credit facility or other short term acquisition lines of credit  which we subsequently repay with long term secured floating rate mortgage debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in short term interest rates on our cash flow from operations  we generally enter into interest rate swap or interest rate cap agreements at the time we enter into term borrowings 
commitments the following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments  excluding periodic interest payments  as of december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years thereafter long term debt obligations minimum lease payments purchase commitments related to capital expenditures associated with tenant improvements and repositioning and other purchase obligations total includes million of debt carried by the honolulu club joint venture in which we held a interest and million of debt carried by fund x in which we held a interest of the common equity 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively  at december  and net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for compared to million for the increase in reflects higher net cash flow from existing properties that generated improved results  as well as incremental cash flow from acquired properties 
net cash used in investing activities increased million to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to a higher level of spending on property acquisitions in the period compared to the period 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million to million for compared to million for the comparative difference was primarily due to the increased level of borrowings associated with property acquisitions in as compared to the use of funds primarily for equity repurchases in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
in conjunction with our ipo  we entered into two new series of interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts 
the first series effectively offset all future changes in fair value from our existing interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts  and the second series effectively replaced the existing interest rate contracts and qualified for cash flow hedge accounting under fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  as amended and interpreted 
we only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
for a description of our interest rate contracts  please see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report
