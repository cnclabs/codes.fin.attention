table of contents part ii continued management s financial review tabular dollars in millions  except per share data our business the pepsi bottling group  inc is the world s largest manufacturer  seller and distributor of pepsi cola beverages 
when used in these consolidated financial statements  pbg  we  our  us and the company each refers to the pepsi bottling group  inc and  where appropriate  to bottling group  llc bottling llc  our principal operating subsidiary 
we have the exclusive right to manufacture  sell and distribute pepsi cola beverages in all or a portion of the us  mexico  canada  spain  russia  greece and turkey 
pbg manages and reports operating results through three reportable segments us canada  europe which includes spain  russia  greece and turkey and mexico 
as shown in the graph below  the us canada segment is the dominant driver of our results  generating percent of our volume and percent of our net revenues 
volume total billion raw cases revenue total billion bar graph bar graph the majority of our volume is derived from brands licensed from pepsico  inc pepsico or pepsico joint ventures 
these brands are some of the most recognized in the world and consist of carbonated soft drinks csds and non carbonated beverages 
our csds include brands such as pepsi cola  diet pepsi  diet pepsi max  mountain dew and sierra mist 
our non carbonated beverages portfolio includes brands with starbucks frapuccino in the ready to drink coffee category  mountain dew amp and sobe adrenaline rush in the energy drink category  sobe and tropicana in the juice and juice drinks category  aquafina in the water category  and lipton iced tea in the tea category 
we continue to strengthen our powerful portfolio highlighted by our focus on the hydration category with sobe life water  propel fitness water and g in the us in some of our territories we have the right to manufacture  sell and distribute soft drink products of companies other than pepsico  including dr pepper  crush and squirt 
we also have the right in some of our territories to manufacture  sell and distribute beverages under brands that we own  including electropura  e pura and garci crespo 
see part i  item of this report for a listing of our principal products by segment 
we sell our products through cold drink and take home channels 
our cold drink channel consists of chilled products sold in the retail and foodservice channels 
we earn the highest profit margins on a per case basis in the cold drink channel 
our take home channel consists of unchilled products that are sold in the retail  mass merchandiser and club store channels for at home consumption 
our products are brought to market primarily through direct store delivery dsd or third party distribution  including foodservice and vending distribution networks 
the hallmarks of the company s dsd system are customer service  speed to market  flexibility and reach 
these are all critical factors in bringing new products to market  adding accounts to our existing base and meeting increasingly diverse volume demands 
our customers range from large format accounts  including large chain foodstores  supercenters  mass merchandisers  chain drug stores  club stores and military bases  to small independently owned shops and foodservice businesses 
changing consumer shopping trends and on the go lifestyles are shifting more of our volume to fast growing channels such as supercenters  club and dollar stores 
retail consolidation continues to increase the strategic significance of our large volume customers 
in  sales to our top five retail customers represented approximately percent of our net revenues 
pbg s focus is on superior sales execution  customer service  merchandising and operating excellence 
our goal is to help our customers grow their beverage business by making our portfolio of brands readily available to consumers at every shopping occasion  using proven methods to grow not only pepsico brand sales  but the overall beverage category 
our objective is to ensure we have the right product in the right package to satisfy the ever changing needs of today s consumers 
we measure our sales in terms of physical cases sold to our customers 
each package  as sold to our customers  regardless of configuration or number of units within a package  represents one physical case 
our net price and gross margin on a per case basis are impacted by how much we charge for the product  the mix of brands and packages we sell  and the channels through which the product is sold 
for example  we realize a higher net revenue and gross margin per case on a ounce chilled bottle sold in a convenience store than on a liter unchilled bottle sold in a grocery store 
our financial success is dependent on a number of factors  including our strong partnership with pepsico  the customer relationships we cultivate  the pricing we achieve in the marketplace  our market execution  our ability to meet changing consumer preferences and the efficiencies we achieve in manufacturing and distributing our products 
key indicators of our financial success are the number of physical cases we sell  the net price and gross margin we achieve on a per case basis  our overall cost productivity which reflects how well we manage our raw material  manufacturing  distribution and other overhead costs  and cash and capital management 
the discussion and analysis throughout management s financial review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the related accompanying notes  including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes  environmental and other matters arising from the normal course of business 
we apply our best judgment  our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future  in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances  such as current economic conditions  and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change 
as future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision  actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following policies  which require the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment  to be the most critical to the portrayal of pbg s results of operations and financial condition 
we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and have discussed the selection of these policies and related disclosures with the audit and affiliated transactions committee of our board of directors 
other intangible assets  net and goodwill our intangible assets consist primarily of franchise rights  distribution rights  licensing rights  brands and goodwill and principally arise from the allocation of the purchase price of businesses acquired 
these intangible assets  other than goodwill  are classified as either finite lived intangibles or indefinite lived intangibles 
the classification of intangibles and the determination of the appropriate useful life require substantial judgment 
the determination of the expected life depends upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset 
in our evaluation of the expected life of these intangible assets  we consider the nature and terms of the underlying agreements  our intent and ability to use the specific asset  the age and market position of the products within the territories in which we are entitled to sell  the historical and projected growth of those products  and costs  if any  to renew the related agreement 
intangible assets that are determined to have a finite life are amortized over their expected useful life  which generally ranges from five to twenty years 
for intangible assets with finite lives  evaluations for impairment are performed only if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  however  they are evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
prior to  the company completed this test in the fourth quarter 
during  the company changed its impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to the third quarter  with the exception of mexico s intangible assets 
impairment testing of mexico s intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was completed in the fourth quarter to coincide with the completion of our strategic review of the business 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which we determined to be the countries in which we operate 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit  as determined by its discounted cash flows  with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
we evaluate other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment by comparing the fair values of the assets with their carrying values 
the fair value of our franchise rights  distribution rights and licensing rights is measured using a multi period excess earnings method that is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
the fair value of our brands is measured using a multi period royalty savings method  which reflects the savings realized by owning the brand and  therefore  not requiring payment of third party royalty fees 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows in conducting an impairment analysis for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the cash flows may be impacted by future actions taken by us and our competitors and the volatility of macroeconomic conditions in the markets in which we conduct business 
assumptions used in our impairment analysis  such as forecasted growth rates  cost of capital and additional risk premiums used in the valuations  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our long term strategic plans 
an inability to achieve strategic business plan targets in a reporting unit  a change in our discount rate or other assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets  which could then result in a material non cash impairment charge to our results of operations 
the recent volatility in the global macroeconomic conditions has had a negative impact on our business results 
if this volatility continues to persist into the future  the fair value of our intangible assets could be adversely impacted 
as a result of the impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  the company recorded a million non cash impairment charge relating primarily to distribution rights and brands for the electropura water business in mexico 
the impairment charge relating to these intangible assets was based upon the findings of an extensive strategic review and the finalization of restructuring plans for our mexican business 
in light of the weakening macroeconomic conditions and our outlook for the business in mexico  we lowered our expectation of the future performance  which reduced the value of these intangible assets and triggered the impairment charge 
after recording the above mentioned impairment charge  mexico s remaining net book value of goodwill and other intangible assets is approximately million 
for further information about our goodwill and other intangible assets see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement medical benefit plans we sponsor pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans in various forms in the united states and similar pension plans in our international locations  covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the assets  liabilities and expenses associated with our international plans were not significant to our worldwide results of operations or financial position  and accordingly  assumptions  expenses  sensitivity analyses and other data regarding these plans are not included in any of the discussions provided below 

table of contents part ii continued in the us  the non contributory defined benefit pension plans provide benefits to certain full time salaried and hourly employees 
benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation  or stated amounts for each year of service 
effective january   newly hired salaried and non union hourly employees are not eligible to participate in these plans 
additionally  effective april   benefits from these plans will no longer continue to accrue for certain salaried and non union employees that do not meet age and service requirements 
the impact of these plan changes will significantly reduce the company s future long term pension obligation  pension expense and cash contributions to the plans 
employees not eligible to participate in these plans or employees whose benefits will be discontinued will receive additional company retirement contributions under the company s defined contribution plans 
substantially all of our us employees meeting age and service requirements are eligible to participate in our postretirement medical benefit plans 
assumptions effective for the fiscal year  the company adopted the measurement date provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
as a result of adopting sfas  the company s measurement date for plan assets and benefit obligations was changed from september to its fiscal year end 
the determination of pension and postretirement medical plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefit obligations 
significant assumptions include discount rate  expected return on plan assets  certain employee related factors such as retirement age  mortality  and turnover  rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings  and for retiree medical plans  health care cost trend rates 
on an annual basis we evaluate these assumptions  which are based upon historical experience of the plans and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
these assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions 
a change in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and postretirement medical benefit expenses and obligations as well as related funding requirements 
the discount rates used in calculating the present value of our pension and postretirement medical benefit plan obligations are developed based on a yield curve that is comprised of high quality  non callable corporate bonds 
these bonds are rated aa or better by moody s  have a principal amount of at least million  are denominated in us dollars  and have maturity dates ranging from six months to thirty years  which matches the timing of our expected benefit payments 
the expected rate of return on plan assets for a given fiscal year is based upon actual historical returns and the long term outlook on asset classes in the pension plans investment portfolio 
in connection with the pension plan design change we changed our asset allocation targets 
the current target asset allocation for the us pension plans is percent equity investments  of which approximately half is to be invested in domestic equities and half is to be invested in foreign equities 
the remaining percent is to be invested primarily in long term corporate bonds 
based on our revised asset allocation  historical returns and estimated future outlook of the pension plans portfolio  we changed our estimated long term rate of return on plan assets assumption from percent to percent 
differences between the assumed rate of return and actual rate of return on plan assets are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss in equity and amortized to earnings utilizing the market related value method 
under this method  differences between the assumed rate of return and actual rate of return from any one year will be recognized over a five year period to determine the market related value 
other gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and from differences between assumed and actual experience are determined at each measurement date and deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss in equity 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds percent of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized to earnings over the average remaining service period of active participants 
the cost or benefit from benefit plan changes is also deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss in equity and amortized to earnings on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 
net unrecognized losses and unamortized prior service costs relating to the pension and postretirement plans in the united states  totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the following tables provide the weighted average assumptions for our and pension and postretirement medical plans expense pension discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets net of administrative expenses rate of compensation increase postretirement discount rate rate of compensation increase health care cost trend rate during  our ongoing defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan expenses totaled million  which excludes one time charges of approximately million associated with restructuring actions and our pension plan design change 
in  these expenses are expected to increase by approximately million to million as a result of the following factors a decrease in our weighted average discount rate for our pension expense from percent to percent  reflecting decreases in the yields of long term corporate bonds comprising the yield curve 
this 
table of contents change in assumption will increase our pension expense by approximately million 
asset losses during will increase our pension expense by million 
a decrease in the rate of return on plan asset assumption from percent to percent  due to revised asset allocation  historical trends and our projected long term outlook 
this change in assumption will increase our pension expense by approximately million 
the pension design change  which will freeze benefits of certain salaried and non union hourly employees  will decrease our pension expense by approximately million 
additional expected contributions to the pension trust will decrease pension expense by million 
other factors  including improved health care claim experience  will decrease our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expenses by approximately million 
in addition  we expect our defined contribution plan expense will increase by million to million due to additional contributions to this plan for employees impacted by the pension design change 
sensitivity analysis it is unlikely that in any given year the actual rate of return will be the same as the assumed long term rate of return 
the following table provides a summary for the last three years of actual rates of return versus expected long term rates of return for our pension plan assets expected rates of return on plan assets net of administrative expenses actual rates of return on plan assets net of administrative expenses sensitivity of changes in key assumptions for our pension and postretirement plans expense in are as follows discount rate a basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the expense for the pension and postretirement medical benefit plans by approximately million 
expected rate of return on plan assets a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease the expense for the pension plans by approximately million 
the postretirement medical benefit plans have no expected return on plan assets as they are funded from the general assets of the company as the payments come due 
contribution to the plan a million decrease in planned contributions to the plan for will increase our pension expense by million 
funding we make contributions to the pension trust to provide plan benefits for certain pension plans 
generally  we do not fund the pension plans if current contributions would not be tax deductible 
effective in  under the pension protection act  funding requirements are more stringent and require companies to make minimum contributions equal to their service cost plus amortization of their deficit over a seven year period 
failure to achieve appropriate funded levels will result in restrictions on employee benefits 
failure to contribute the minimum required contributions will result in excise taxes for the company and reporting to the regulatory agencies 
during  the company contributed million to its pension trusts 
the company expects to contribute an additional million to its pension trusts in  of which approximately million is to satisfy minimum funding requirements 
these amounts exclude million and million of contributions to the unfunded plans for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
for further information about our pension and postretirement plans see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
casualty insurance costs due to the nature of our business  we require insurance coverage for certain casualty risks 
in the united states  we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity 
this captive entity participates in a reinsurance pool for a portion of our workers compensation risk 
we provide self insurance for the workers compensation risk retained by the company and automobile risks up to million per occurrence  and product and general liability risks up to million per occurrence 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from third party providers 
at december   our net liability for casualty costs was million  of which million was considered short term in nature 
at december   our net liability for casualty costs was million  of which million was considered short term in nature 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability 
we evaluate these estimates periodically during the year and we believe that they are appropriate  however  an increase or decrease in the estimates or events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of these costs may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize in the future 
we establish valuation 
table of contents part ii continued allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as required under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal year  we recognize the impact of our tax positions in our financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have established a tax reserve is audited and finally resolved  and the number of years for which we have audits that are open varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of an audit  we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that is more likely than not to occur 
nevertheless  it is possible that tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions  which could have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the resolution of a tax position could be recognized as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes and our deferred taxes in the period of resolution  and may also require a use of cash 
for further information about our income taxes see income tax expense in the results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
relationship with pepsico pepsico is a related party due to the nature of our franchise relationship and its ownership interest in our company 
more than percent of our volume is derived from the sale of pepsico brands 
at december   pepsico owned approximately percent of our outstanding common stock and percent of our outstanding class b common stock  together representing approximately percent of the voting power of all classes of our voting stock 
in addition  at december   pepsico owned percent of the equity of bottling llc and percent of pr beverages limited pr beverages  a consolidated venture for our russian operations 
we fully consolidate the results of bottling llc and pr beverages and present pepsico s share as minority interest in our consolidated financial statements 
on march   together with pepsico  we formed pr beverages  a venture that enables us to strategically invest in russia to accelerate our growth 
pbg contributed its business in russia to pr beverages  and pepsico entered into bottling agreements with pr beverages for pepsico beverage products sold in russia on the same terms as in effect for pbg immediately prior to the venture 
pr beverages has an exclusive license to manufacture and sell pepsico concentrate for such products 
increases in gross profit and operating income resulting from the consolidation of the venture are offset by minority interest expense related to pepsico s share 
minority interest expense is recorded below operating income 
our business is conducted primarily under beverage agreements with pepsico  including a master bottling agreement  non cola bottling agreements  distribution agreements and a master syrup agreement 
these agreements provide pepsico with the ability  at its sole discretion  to establish prices  and other terms and conditions for our purchase of concentrates and finished products from pepsico 
pepsico provides us with bottler funding to support a variety of trade and consumer programs such as consumer incentives  advertising support  new product support and vending and cooler equipment placement 
the nature and type of programs  as well as the level of funding  vary annually 
additionally  under a shared services agreement  we obtain various services from pepsico  which include services for information technology maintenance and the procurement of raw materials 
we also provide services to pepsico  including facility and credit and collection support 
because we depend on pepsico to provide us with concentrate which we use in the production of csds and non carbonated beverages  bottler incentives and various services  changes in our relationship with pepsico could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

as of year end  we had available short term bank credit lines of approximately million  of which million was outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of percent

market risks and cautionary statements quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks 
these risks include changes in the price of commodities purchased and used in our business  interest rates on outstanding debt and currency movements impacting our non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
we are also subject to the risks associated with the business environment in which we operate 
we regularly assess all of these risks and have strategies in place to reduce the adverse effects of these exposures 
our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates is to minimize the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in the applicable rates and prices 
to achieve this objective  we have derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
we monitor our counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our derivative instruments 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on our financial instruments 
these sensitivity analyses evaluate the effect of hypothetical changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in our stock price on our unfunded deferred compensation liability 
information provided by these sensitivity analyses does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that we would incur under normal market conditions because  due to practical limitations  all variables other than the specific market risk factor were held constant 
as a result  the reported changes in the values of some financial instruments that are affected by the sensitivity analyses are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge 
commodity price risk we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive business environment in which we operate 
we use future and option contracts to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity 
table of contents prices related primarily to anticipated purchases of raw materials and energy used in our operations 
with respect to commodity price risk  we currently have various contracts outstanding for commodity purchases in and  which establish our purchase prices within defined ranges 
we estimate that a percent decrease in commodity prices with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our financial instruments of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is inherent to both fixed and floating rate debt 
we effectively converted billion of our senior notes to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps 
changes in interest rates on our interest rate swaps and other variable debt would change our interest expense 
we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt and cash equivalents  with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in an increase to net interest expense of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk in  approximately percent of our net revenues were generated from outside the united states 
social  economic and political conditions in these international markets may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the overall risks to our international businesses include changes in foreign governmental policies and other social  political or economic developments 
these developments may lead to new product pricing  tax or other policies and monetary fluctuations that may adversely impact our business 
in addition  our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our businesses outside the us into us dollars affects year over year comparability 
we generally have not hedged against these types of currency risks because cash flows from our international operations have been reinvested locally 
we have foreign currency transactional risks in certain of our international territories for transactions that are denominated in currencies that are different from their functional currency 
we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge portions of our forecasted us dollar cash flows in these international territories 
a percent weaker us dollar against the applicable foreign currency  with all other variables held constant  would result in a change in the fair value of these contracts of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
in  we entered into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of intercompany receivable balances that are denominated in mexican pesos 
a percent weaker us dollar versus the mexican peso  with all other variables held constant  would result in a change of million and million in the fair value of these contracts at december  and december   respectively 
unfunded deferred compensation liability our unfunded deferred compensation liability is subject to changes in our stock price  as well as price changes in certain other equity and fixed income investments 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 
since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust the employee s deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to the employees accounts increases or decreases the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price 
therefore  changes in compensation expense as a result of changes in our stock price are substantially offset by the changes in the fair value of these contracts 
we estimate that a percent unfavorable change in the year end stock price would have reduced the fair value from these forward contract commitments by million and million at december  and december   respectively 
cautionary statements except for the historical information and discussions contained herein  statements contained in this annual report on form k and in the annual report to the shareholders may constitute forward looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans

we classify bottler incentives as follows direct marketplace support represents pepsico s and other brand owners agreed upon funding to assist us in offering sales and promotional discounts to retailers and is generally recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales 
if the direct marketplace support is a reimbursement for a specific  incremental and identifiable program  the funding is recorded as an offset to the cost of the program either in net revenues or selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
advertising support represents agreed upon funding to assist us with the cost of media time and promotional materials and is generally recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales 
advertising support that represents reimbursement for a specific  incremental and identifiable media cost  is recorded as a reduction to advertising and marketing expenses within selling  delivery and administrative expenses 

table of contents part ii continued total bottler incentives recognized as adjustments to net revenues  cost of sales and selling  delivery and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations were as follows fiscal year ended net revenues cost of sales selling  delivery and administrative expenses total bottler incentives share based compensation the company grants a combination of stock option awards and restricted stock units to our middle and senior management and our board of directors 
see note for further discussion on our share based compensation 
shipping and handling costs our shipping and handling costs reported in the consolidated statements of operations are recorded primarily within selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
such costs recorded within selling  delivery and administrative expenses totaled billion in  and foreign currency gains and losses and currency translation we translate the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  while we translate the statements of operations at the average rates of exchange during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments of our foreign subsidiaries are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of minority interest on our consolidated balance sheets 
transactional gains and losses arising from the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions in foreign currency that is different from the local functional currency are included in other non operating expenses income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
pension and postretirement medical benefit plans we sponsor pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans in various forms in the us and other similar plans in our international locations  covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
on december   we adopted the funded status provision of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  which requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of the pension and other postretirement plans 
in addition  on december   we adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas  which requires that our assumptions used to measure our annual pension and postretirement medical expenses be determined as of the year end balance sheet date and all plan assets and liabilities be reported as of that date 
for fiscal years ended and prior  the majority of the pension and other postretirement plans used a september measurement date and all plan assets and obligations were generally reported as of that date 
as part of measuring the plan assets and benefit obligations on december   we adjusted our opening balances of retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss for the change in net periodic benefit cost and fair value  respectively  from the previously used september measurement date 
the adoption of the measurement date provisions resulted in a net decrease in the pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans liability of million  a net decrease in retained earnings of million  net of minority interest of million and taxes of million and a net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of million  net of minority interest of million and taxes of million 
there was no impact on our results of operations 
the determination of pension and postretirement medical plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefit obligations 
significant assumptions include discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  certain employee related factors such as retirement age  mortality  and turnover  rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings  and for retiree medical plans  health care cost trend rates 
we evaluate these assumptions on an annual basis at each measurement date based upon historical experience of the plans and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
differences between the assumed rate of return and actual return of plan assets are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss in equity and amortized to earnings utilizing the market related value method 
under this method  differences between the assumed rate of return and actual rate of return from any one year will be recognized over a five year period in the market related value 
other gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and from differences between assumed and actual experience are determined at each measurement date and deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss in equity 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds percent of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized to earnings over the average remaining service period of active participants 
the cost or benefit from benefit plan changes is also deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss in equity and amortized to earnings on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 
see note for further discussion on our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize in the future 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as required under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal year  we recognize the impact of our tax positions in our financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit  based on the technical merit of the position 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate 
see note for further discussion on our income taxes 
earnings per share we compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other equity awards from stock compensation plans were exercised and converted into common stock that would then participate in net income 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities not exceeding three months at the time of purchase 
the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximate the amounts shown on our consolidated balance sheets due to their short term nature 
allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to non payment  bankruptcies and sales returns 
our accounting policy for the provision for doubtful accounts requires reserving an amount based on the evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable  sales return trend analysis  detailed analysis of high risk customers accounts  and the overall market and economic conditions of our customers 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the cost of our inventory is generally computed on the first in  first out method 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment pp e at cost  except for pp e that has been impaired  for which we write down the carrying amount to estimated fair market value  which then becomes the new cost basis 
other intangible assets  net and goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  however  they are evaluated for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
intangible assets that are determined to have a finite life are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which we expect to receive economic benefit  which generally ranges from five to twenty years  and are evaluated for impairment only if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of the expected life depends upon the use and the underlying characteristics of the intangible asset 
in our evaluation of the expected life of these intangible assets  we consider the nature and terms of the underlying agreements  our intent and ability to use the specific asset  the age and market position of the products within the territories in which we are entitled to sell  the historical and projected growth of those products  and costs  if any  to renew the related agreement 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
initial fair value is generally based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques 
see note for further discussion on our goodwill and other intangible assets 
casualty insurance costs in the united states  we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity 
this captive entity participates in a reinsurance pool for a portion of our workers compensation risk 
we provide self insurance for the workers compensation risk retained by the company and automobile risks up to million per occurrence  and product and general liability risks up to million per occurrence 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from a third party provider 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
minority interest minority interest is recorded for the entities that we consolidate but are not wholly owned by pbg 
minority interest recorded in our consolidated financial statements is primarily comprised of pepsico s share of bottling llc and pr beverages 
at december   pepsico owned percent of bottling llc and percent of pr beverages venture 
treasury stock we record the repurchase of shares of our common stock at cost and classify these shares as treasury stock within shareholders equity 
repurchased shares are included in our authorized and issued shares but not included in our shares outstanding 
we record shares reissued using an average cost 
at december   we had million shares authorized under our share repurchase program 
since the inception of our share repurchase program in october  we have repurchased approximately million shares and have reissued approximately million for stock option exercises 
financial instruments and risk management we use derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements associated with commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
derivative instruments are generally designated and accounted for as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge 
the derivative s gain or loss recognized in earnings is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item 
if a fair value or cash flow hedge were to cease to qualify for hedge accounting or were terminated  it would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled  but hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively 
if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist  any associated amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to earnings at that time 
we also may enter into a derivative instrument for which hedge accounting is not required because it is entered into to offset changes in the fair value of an underlying transaction recognized in earnings economic hedge 
these instruments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 

table of contents part ii continued commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
liabilities related to commitments and contingencies are recognized when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable

note earnings per share the following table reconciles the shares outstanding and net earnings used in the computations of both basic and diluted earnings per share fiscal year ended shares in millions net income weighted average shares outstanding during period on which basic earnings per share is calculated effect of dilutive shares incremental shares under stock compensation plans weighted average shares outstanding during period on which diluted earnings per share is calculated basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other equity awards from our stock compensation plans were exercised and converted into common stock that would then participate in net income 
diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended and exclude the dilutive effect of million and million stock options  respectively 
these shares were excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation because for the years noted  the exercise price of the stock options was greater than the average market price of the company s common shares during the related periods and the effect of including the stock options in the computation would be anti dilutive 
for the fiscal year ended  there were no stock options excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation 

table of contents note share based compensation accounting for share based compensation effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
among its provisions  sfas r requires the company to recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value 
the company adopted sfas r in using the modified prospective approach 
under this transition method  the measurement and our method of amortization of costs for share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   would be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same amortization method that was previously used in our sfas pro forma disclosure 
results for prior periods have not been restated as provided for under the modified prospective approach 
for equity awards granted after the date of adoption  we amortize share based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting term 
compensation expense is recognized only for share based payments expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures  both at the date of grant as well as throughout the vesting period  based on the company s historical experience and future expectations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the effect of forfeitures on the pro forma expense amounts was recognized based on estimated forfeitures

the table below outlines the weighted average assumptions for options granted during years ended december   december  and december  risk free interest rate expected term in years expected volatility expected dividend yield the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining expected term 
the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time employees will retain their vested stocks until exercise 
due to the lack of historical experience in stock option exercises  we estimate expected term utilizing a combination of the simplified method as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
and historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of the company s stock and the implied volatility of its traded options 
the expected dividend yield is management s long term estimate of annual dividends to be paid as a percentage of share price 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of pbg stock on the date of grant 
we receive a tax deduction for certain stock option exercises when the options are exercised  generally for the excess of the stock price over the exercise price of the options 
additionally  we receive a tax deduction for restricted stock units equal to the fair market value of pbg s stock at the date the restricted stock units are converted to pbg stock 
sfas r requires that benefits received from tax deductions resulting from the grant date fair value of equity awards be reported as operating cash inflows in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
benefits from tax deductions in excess of the grant date fair value from equity awards are treated as financing cash inflows in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in tax benefits from equity awards in the consolidated statements of cash flows  of which million was recorded in the financing section with the remaining being recorded in cash from operations

annual impairment testing the company completes its impairment testing of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently as indicators warrant 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  however  they are evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
in previous years the company completed this test in the fourth quarter using a measurement date of third quarter end 
during the second quarter ended june   the company changed its impairment testing of goodwill to the third quarter  using a measurement date at the beginning of the third quarter 
with the exception of mexico s intangible assets  the company has also changed its impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to the third quarter  using a measurement date at the beginning of the third quarter 
impairment testing of mexico s intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was completed in the fourth quarter to coincide with the completion of the strategic review of the business 
as a result of this testing  the company recorded a million non cash impairment charge million net of tax and minority interest 
the impairment charge relates primarily to distribution rights and brands for electropura water business in mexico 
the impairment charge relating to these intangible assets was determined based upon the findings of an extensive strategic review and the finalization of certain restructuring plans for our mexican business 
in light of weakening macroeconomic conditions and our outlook for the business in mexico  we lowered our expectations of the future performance  which reduced the value of these intangible assets and triggered an impairment charge 
the fair value of our franchise rights and distribution rights was estimated using a multi period excess earnings method that is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
the fair value of our brands was estimated using a multi period royalty savings method  which reflects the savings realized by owning the brand and  therefore  not having to pay a royalty fee to a third party

note fair value measurements we adopted sfas at the beginning of fiscal for all financial instruments valued on a recurring basis  at least annually 
the standard defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
it also establishes a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

table of contents level observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in non active markets  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs reflecting management s own assumptions about the input used in pricing the asset or liability 
if the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy  the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument

these contracts generally range from one to months in duration and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
at december   the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts was a million gain recorded in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
in  million of a gain was recognized in aocl and million of a loss was reclassified into earnings in cost of goods sold for our foreign exchange contracts 
for these cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument is deferred in aocl until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a fair value change on a qualifying cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings immediately and is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item 
we have also entered into treasury rate lock agreements to hedge against adverse interest rate changes on certain debt financing arrangements  which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
gains and losses that are considered effective are deferred in aocl and amortized to interest expense over the duration of the debt term 
in  we recognized a million loss in aocl for treasury rate locks that settled in the fourth quarter 
additionally  in  we reclassified from aocl million of a loss to interest expense from our treasury rate locks that previously settled

during we recognized million of ineffectiveness for the treasury locks that were settled in the fourth quarter 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our other contracts was not material to our results of operations in  or fair value hedges we finance a portion of our operations through fixed rate debt instruments 
we effectively converted billion of our senior notes to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these interest rate swaps meet the criteria for fair value hedge accounting and are percent effective in eliminating the market rate risk inherent in our long term debt 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with these swaps is fully offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
during  the fair value of the interest rate swaps increased to a net asset of million at december  from a liability of million at december  the fair value of our swaps was recorded in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency hedges we entered into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of our intercompany receivable balances that are denominated in mexican pesos

unfunded deferred compensation liability our unfunded deferred compensation liability is subject to changes in our stock price as well as 
table of contents part ii continued price changes in other equity and fixed income investments 
participating employees in our deferred compensation program can elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to be paid out on a future date or dates 
as part of the deferral process  employees select from phantom investment options that determine the earnings on the deferred compensation liability and the amount that they will ultimately receive 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 
since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust his or her deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to employees accounts increases or decreases the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price 
at december   we had a prepaid forward contract for  shares at a price of  which was accounted for as an economic hedge 
this contract requires cash settlement and has a fair value at december   of million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of this contract changes based on the change in our stock price compared with the contract exercise price 
we recognized an expense of million and income of million in and  respectively  resulting from the change in fair value of these prepaid forward contracts 
the earnings impact from these instruments is recorded in selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
other financial assets and liabilities financial assets with carrying values approximating fair value include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
financial liabilities with carrying values approximating fair value include accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and short term debt 
the carrying value of these financial assets and liabilities approximates fair value due to their short maturities and since interest rates approximate current market rates for short term debt 
long term debt  which includes the current maturities of long term debt  at december   had a carrying value and fair value of billion and billion  respectively  and at december   had a carrying value and fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
the fair value is based on interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities

our tax filings are subject to review by various tax authorities who may disagree with our positions 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position  for which we have established tax reserves  is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of an audit  we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that is more likely than not to occur 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the resolution of a matter could be recognized as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes and our deferred taxes in the period of resolution  and may also require a use of cash

table of contents years through we are in agreement with the audit results except for one matter which we continue to dispute for our through tax years 
in january   we reached an agreement with the irs related to our audit years  which will result in a cash payment of approximately million 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that our worldwide reserves for uncertain tax benefits could decrease in the range of million to million within the next twelve months as a result of the completion of audits in various jurisdictions  including the settlement with the irs and the expiration of statute of limitations 
the reductions in our tax reserves will result in a combination of additional tax payments  the adjustment of certain deferred taxes or the recognition of tax benefits in our income statement 
in the event that we cannot reach settlement of some of these audits  our tax reserves may increase  although we cannot estimate such potential increases at this time
