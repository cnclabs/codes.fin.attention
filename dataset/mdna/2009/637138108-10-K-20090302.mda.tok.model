during  we served communities throughout a fourteen county market area in pennsylvania berks  bucks  carbon  centre  chester  delaware  lancaster  lehigh  luzerne  monroe  montgomery  northampton  philadelphia and schuylkill  as well as the cecil county  maryland area and the greater wilmington area of new castle county  delaware 
within this geographic region  there are seven distinct market areas the reading berks county area  an area in which the service industry is increasingly replacing the old line manufacturing industry  the greater lehigh valley area  consisting of lehigh  northampton  southern carbon and monroe counties  also an area in which a growing service industry is replacing the old line manufacturing industry  the northeast pennsylvania region  consisting of luzerne  schuylkill and northern carbon counties  a mix of urban  suburban and rural areas  the five county philadelphia metropolitan area  consisting of philadelphia and its suburbs in bucks  chester  delaware and montgomery counties  lancaster county  an area with a significant agricultural economy  centre county  consisting of the state college bellefonte area  and the greater wilmington area of new castle county  delaware  an area with substantial industrial operations 
competition the banking and financial services industry is extremely competitive in our market area 
we face vigorous competition for customers  loans and deposits from many companies  including commercial banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  credit unions  trust companies  mortgage companies  money market mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment firms 
many of these competitors are significantly larger than national penn  have greater resources  lending limits and larger branch systems  offer a wider array of banking services than national penn  and are long established in their geographic markets some of which have only been recently entered by national penn 
see general development of business below 
in addition  some of these competitors are subject to a lesser degree of regulation than that imposed on national penn 
many of these competitors have elected to become financial holding companies under the gramm leach bliley act of  including many of the largest ones 
this development will likely further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
see gramm leach bliley act below 
business strategy our goal is to become the most highly regarded financial institution in the markets we serve 
we intend to accomplish this goal by combining the sophisticated products and fee based services of a major regional financial services company with the personal attention  service and responsiveness of a community bank holding company 
we believe this strategy results in greater profitability than a typical community bank 
the primary components of our business strategy are commercial banking  consumer banking  niche marketing  development of fee income  and enhanced customer service 
commercial banking 
commercial banking has been our historic and ongoing business focus 
our business customers tend to be small to middle market customers with annual gross revenues generally between million and million 
many of these customers require us to have a high degree of understanding of their business in order for us to be able to customize solutions to their financial requirements 
we believe that this helps to distinguish us from our competitors 
we offer a wide range of products including short term loans for seasonal and working capital purposes  term loans secured by real estate and other assets  loans for construction and expansion needs  revolving credit plans  leveraged finance or business acquisition financing  interest rate derivatives and sophisticated cash management services 
we also engage in commercial real estate lending  including loans to developers of both residential and commercial projects 
as of december   our commercial loan portfolio was billion  which represents of our total loans outstanding 
another important component of our commercial lending practice is our emphasis on small businesses and their unique needs 
in order to serve small businesses better  national penn bank is an approved sba preferred express lender by the us small business administration 
being a preferred express lender authorizes us to underwrite and approve qualifying small business loans without the prior approval of the small business administration 
consumer banking 
we offer a full range of deposit accounts  which include demand  now  money market  certificates of deposit and other checking and savings accounts 
we also offer consumer loan products such as installment loans  home equity loans  residential mortgage loans  multi family loans  educational loans and credit cards 
in addition  we offer automated teller services through an inter bank automated teller system  safe deposit and night depository facilities and internet banking services  including on line bill paying 
the company continues to focus its efforts in further development of retail products and services 
niche marketing 
an important component of our business strategy is the development of business lines that give us higher margin opportunities 
we are continually assessing the markets within which we operate in order to identify and seize upon opportunities where we believe a market segment is being under served 
once identified  we focus on customizing solutions that are beneficial to the user and profitable to us 
an example is our manufacturing group 
the manufacturing group is a unique lending group whose focus is on assisting manufacturing firms in solving industry specific challenges 
the manufacturing group is comprised of specialized teams of experienced bankers who have industry specific training or experience and can offer an array of resources to time challenged business owners  through the manufacturing group s solutions networktm a database of national penn professionals and other selected third party resource providers who assist with financial and non financial business challenges 
value added areas include industry specific seminars  newsletters  and websites 
at december   the manufacturing group managed relationships with loans outstanding of approximately million 
another example is our leasing company 
national penn leasing company provides equipment lease financing 
it has been in business since december and had total leases outstanding of million as of december  other examples are our international banking group and our government banking group 
the international banking group provides for customer import  export and general documentary credit  foreign exchange and international payment needs 
as of december   the unit managed a letter of credit portfolio totaling million 
the international banking group has been in operation since june our government banking group  formed in  serves the unique banking needs of local government entities such as school districts  municipalities and townships 
at december   our government banking group deposits totaled million 
development of fee income 
in addition to generation of fee income through our commercial banking operations including mortgage lending  we have a number of specialized investment and insurance subsidiaries to develop fee income and to serve specific markets 
we currently provide trust and investment management services through national penn investors trust company  our national trust company subsidiary  and christiana bank trust company 
we also provide investment management services through national penn capital advisors  inc and vantage investment advisors  llc 
securities brokerage services are currently provided by a third party vendor  primevest financial services  inc  under the name national penn investment services 
in total  our wealth management group currently manages and or advises approximately billion for over  individual and corporate accounts 
we currently provide insurance services primarily property and casualty insurance through national penn insurance agency  inc and higgins insurance associates 
we also offer specialized employee benefits consulting services through caruso benefits group  inc these companies currently serve over  customers 
for the year ended december   our efforts in the wealth and insurance business produced fee income for the company of million compared to million for the year ended december  enhanced customer service 
our business strategy is supported by a strong delivery system that places greater emphasis on customer service 
we have segmented our market into regions based primarily on geographic considerations 
each region is managed by a regional president who reports to the chief operating officer 
this officer coordinates our sales and servicing efforts in order to effectively serve our current customers and gain new customers 
the purpose of this initiative is to better leverage our centralized marketing and servicing efforts  thereby increasing sales of the wide range of products and services that we offer 
we believe that this cross functional approach leads to more responsive service for our customers who  in turn  reward us with more of their total financial services business

the company makes commercial loans for real estate development  equipment financing  accounts receivable and inventory financing and other purposes as required by the broad spectrum of borrowers 
commercial loans by their nature carry higher risk than loans to consumers 
the changes in commercial borrowers financial condition and cash flow plus the potential volatility in the value of collateral held makes commercial lending a higher risk form of lending 
consequently  a greater percentage of the company s resources and the staff s time are devoted to monitoring this area of the portfolio 
the company s credit policies determine advance rates against the different forms of collateral that can be pledged against commercial loans 
typically  the majority of loans will be limited to a percentage of their underlying collateral values such as real estate values  new equipment  eligible accounts receivable and finished inventory or raw material

national penn bank s investment portfolio consists primarily of agency and municipal bonds 
the agency bonds include debentures as well as mortgage backed securities issued by gmna  fnma and fhlmc 
agency and municipal bonds carry low risk based capital requirements 
the primary purpose of the national penn bank investment portfolio is to provide a secondary source of liquidity 
another purpose is to provide a source of income 
for liquidity purposes  we concentrate on buying high quality  highly marketable securities 
we also construct the portfolio seeking a steady cash flow stream 
a high percentage of the national penn bank investment portfolio supports our funding pledging needs that is  we must pledge qualifying assets to secure deposits of municipalities and other governmental entities 
in addition to the factors discussed  we follow a strategy of shortening the duration of the investment portfolio when rates are low and lengthening the duration of the investment portfolio when rates are high 
whether we are buying shorter term securities during low rate cycles  or longer term securities during times of higher rates  we consider the impact of the investment portfolio in the company s overall interest rate risk position 
we therefore might adjust the strategy  due to our need to remain consistent with our interest rate risk corporate guidelines 
national penn investment company s portfolio consists primarily of investments in regional or community banking organizations 
these investments are in the form of common stock or trust preferred securities 
the primary purpose of this portfolio is to generate income  including both current income in the form of interest and dividends  as well as long term capital gains 
these investments require the same risk based capital as commercial loans  but the overall dollar amount of this portfolio  million at december   is relatively small so the impact on capital is not material

the discontinuance of any product or service  whether or not any customer or governmental agency has challenged any such product or service  could have a negative impact on national penn s reputation 
future acquisitions our acquisition strategy consists of identifying financial service companies  including banks  insurance agencies and wealth management related businesses  with business philosophies that are similar to ours  which operate in strong markets  and which can be acquired at an acceptable cost 
in evaluating acquisition opportunities  we generally consider potential revenue enhancements and operating efficiencies  asset quality  interest rate risk  and management capabilities 
discussions with acquisition candidates take place frequently 
concentrations  seasonality we do not have any portion of our businesses dependent on a single or limited number of customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business

the guidelines require that bank holding companies maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
for purposes of calculating the ratios  a bank holding company s assets and some of its specified off balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories and its capital is classified in one of three tiers 
the required minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of total capital must be tier capital 
tier capital consists principally of common shareholders equity  retained earnings  a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the federal reserve has ruled that the senior perpetual preferred stock issued to the treasury department under the troubled asset relief program s capital purchase program described in more detail below also qualifies as tier capital 
the remainder of total capital may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities and a limited amount of subordinated debt  qualifying preferred stock and loan loss allowance tier capital 
at december   national penn s tier capital and total tier and tier combined capital ratios were and  respectively 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal reserve requires a bank holding company to maintain a minimum leverage ratio 
this requires a minimum level of tier capital as determined under the risk based capital rules to average total consolidated assets of for those bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion 
the federal reserve expects all other bank holding companies to maintain a ratio of at least to above the stated minimum 
at december   national penn s leverage ratio was 
the federal reserve has also indicated that it will consider a tangible tier capital leverage ratio deducting all intangibles and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the federal reserve has not advised national penn of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to national penn 
the federal deposit insurance act fdia requires an insured institution to take prompt corrective action in the event minimum capital requirements are not met 
pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdia  the federal banking agencies have specified  by regulation  the levels at which an insured institution is considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized 
under these regulations  an institution is considered well capitalized if it satisfies each of the following requirements it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more 
it has a tier risk based capital ratio of or more 
it has a leverage ratio of or more 
it is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
at december   national penn bank qualified as well capitalized under these regulatory standards

the assessments are based on the risk classification of the depository institutions 
national penn bank and christiana were each required to pay subject to certain credits regular fdic insurance assessments in  and expect to be required to pay regular insurance assessments to the fdic in the fdic has announced that  in  it will raise current assessment rates and alter the way in which the assessment system differentiates for risk

the operations of christiana are subject to regulations of the state bank commissioner of the state of delaware and the fdic 
the occ and the fdic  which have primary federal supervisory authority over national penn bank and christiana  respectively  regularly examine banks in such areas as reserves  loans  investments  management practices  trust  and other aspects of operations 
these examinations are designed for the protection of depositors rather than shareholders 
each bank must furnish annual and quarterly reports to the primary regulator  each of which has the legal authority to prevent the bank from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern  among other things  the scope of a bank s business  the investments a bank may make  the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain with its district federal reserve bank  the types and terms of loans a bank may make and the collateral it may take  the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations  and the establishment of branches  including community offices 
pennsylvania law and delaware law each permit statewide branching 
under the national bank act  national penn bank is required to obtain the prior approval of the occ for the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by it in one year would exceed its net profits for the current year plus its retained net profits for the two preceding years  less any required transfers to surplus 
in addition  national penn bank may only pay dividends to the extent that its retained net profits including the portion transferred to surplus exceed statutory bad debts 
under the fdia  national penn bank is prohibited from paying any dividends  making other distributions or paying any management fees if  after such payment  it would fail to satisfy its minimum capital requirements 
christiana is also subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to national penn 
currently  christiana may pay dividends to the extent of its accumulated retained earnings 
as subsidiary banks of a bank holding company  national penn bank and christiana are each subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or its subsidiaries  on investments in the stock or other securities of the bank holding company or its subsidiaries  and on taking such stock or securities as collateral for loans 
the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulations also place certain limitations and reporting requirements on extensions of credit by a bank to the principal shareholders of its parent holding company  among others  and to related interests of such principal shareholders 
in addition  such legislation and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a principal shareholder of a holding company may obtain credit from banks with which the subsidiary bank maintains a correspondent relationship 
regulation of other subsidiaries national penn s direct non bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the federal reserve 
in july  national penn converted investors trust company from a state chartered trust company regulated by the federal reserve and the pennsylvania department of banking to a limited purpose national trust company regulated by the occ 
national penn bank s other direct non bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the occ 
in addition  national penn capital advisors  inc and vantage investment advisors  llc  investment advisory firms  are each primarily subject to regulation by the sec and various state securities regulators 
national penn bank s insurance agency subsidiaries  including those acquired in the knbt merger  are also primarily subject to regulation by the pennsylvania department of insurance 
monetary and fiscal policies the financial services industry  including national penn and its subsidiaries  is affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of government agencies  including the federal reserve 
through open market securities transactions and changes in its discount rate and reserve requirements  the federal reserve exerts considerable influence over the cost and availability of funds for lending and investment 
gramm leach bliley act the gramm leach bliley act of glba repealed various provisions of the glass steagall act to permit commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks securities firms 
amended the bhca to permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in any type of financial activity 
permits subsidiaries of national banks now to engage in a broad range of financial activities that are not permitted for national banks themselves 
the result is that banking companies are generally able to offer a wider range of financial products and services and are more readily able to combine with other types of financial companies  such as securities and insurance companies 
glba created a new kind of bank holding company called a financial holding company a fhc that is authorized to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to financial activities and any activity that the federal reserve determines is complementary to financial activities and does not pose undue risks to the financial system 
a bank holding company qualifies to become a fhc if it files an election with the federal reserve and if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well capitalized  well managed  and cra rated satisfactory or better 
although national penn believes that it is eligible to do so  national penn has not elected to become a fhc 
national penn has  instead  continued to utilize the authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries to expand its business products and services 
glba also authorizes national banks to create financial subsidiaries 
this is in addition to the present authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries 
a financial subsidiary is a direct subsidiary of a national bank that satisfies the same conditions as a fhc  plus certain other conditions  and is approved in advance by the occ 
a financial subsidiary can engage in most  but not all  of the activities newly authorized for a fhc 
national penn bank has not created any financial subsidiaries 
in addition  glba includes significant provisions relating to the privacy of consumer and customer information 
these provisions apply to any company the business of which is engaging in activities permitted for a fhc  even if it is not itself an fhc 
thus  they apply to national penn 
glba requires a financial institution to adopt and disclose its privacy policy  give consumers and customers the right to opt out of most disclosures to non affiliated third parties  not disclose any account information to non affiliated third party marketers and follow regulatory standards to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer and customer information 
although the long range effects of glba cannot be predicted  national penn believes glba will further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
fair credit reporting act the federal banking agencies have issued final regulations implementing the affiliate marketing provisions added to the fair credit reporting act by the fair and accurate credit transactions act 
the regulations  which became effective january   with a mandatory compliance date of october   require a financial institution to provide consumers with notice and an opportunity to opt out before using certain information received from an affiliate to make a marketing solicitation 
usa patriot act in recent years  a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act gave the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers and increased information sharing 
it also substantially broadened the scope of federal anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence policies  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the united states treasury department has issued a number of regulations to implement various provisions of the patriot act 
these regulations impose obligations on national penn to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report potential money laundering and terrorist financing activities and to verify the identity of its customers 
failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing or to comply with all of the relevant laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on national penn s business 
interest on reserves drawing upon its accelerated authority under eesa see troubled asset relief program  below  the federal reserve issued an interim final rule directing that interest be paid on the required and excess reserve balances held by depository institutions at federal reserve banks 
the regulation became effective with the reserve maintenance period beginning october  fdic deposit insurance coverage on october   the fdic increased the amount of deposit insurance coverage per depositor from  to  the increase  which is temporary  will remain effective until december  fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program national penn has enrolled in the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlg  which was established by the fdic in october as an initiative to counter the current system wide crisis in the nation s financial sector 
the tlg provides two limited guarantee programs 
the debt guarantee program dgp guarantees newly issued senior unsecured debt of insured depository institutions and their affiliated bank holding companies 
debt  including promissory notes  commercial paper  inter bank funding  and any unsecured portion of secured debt issued on or before june   is fully protected in the event the issuing institution subsequently fails  or its holding company files for bankruptcy 
the dgp debt guarantee is triggered by payment default rather than bankruptcy or receivership  and short term debt issued for one month or less is not covered 
the dgp guarantee expires on june   even for debt that matures after that date 
the transaction account guarantee program tag guarantees noninterest bearing transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount  held by insured depository institutions 
in addition to traditional demand deposit accounts  the tag covers business payroll accounts  low interest now accounts and funds held in trust by attorneys  called iolta accounts 
insurance coverage under tag lasts through december fees to participate in the dgp are based on the length to maturity of the debt 
for tag participants  a basis point annual rate surcharge is added to an institution s current fdic insurance assessment to cover noninterest bearing transaction account amounts over  troubled asset relief program on october   the emergency economic stabilization act eesa was signed into law for the purpose of providing treasury with the authority and facilities to restore liquidity and stability to the us economy 
central to the eesa is the troubled asset relief program tarp  under which treasury can purchase troubled assets from any financial institution subject to appropriate terms and conditions that minimize the long term negative impact on us taxpayers 
on october   in a joint statement with the fdic and the federal reserve  treasury announced the creation of the tarp capital purchase program cpp to enable treasury to make capital investments in public and private banking institutions 
under cpp  treasury can purchase up to billion of senior preferred shares on standardized terms from qualifying us controlled banks  savings associations  and certain bank and savings and loan holding companies 
a participating institution may sell shares of its senior preferred stock valued between and of its risk weighted assets 
senior preferred stock ranks senior to common stock and pari passu with existing senior preferred stock  is non voting  and is callable at par after three years 
shares of senior preferred stock pay a cumulative annual dividend of for the first five years and in later years 
as part of the purchase transaction  treasury also receives warrants to purchase common stock in the institution equating to of the market price of its investment in the senior preferred stock at the time of issuance 
national penn applied to participate in cpp and received treasury approval to do so 
on december   by letter agreement  which included cpp standardized terms  national penn issued and sold to treasury i  shares of national penn s series b fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock having a liquidation preference of  per share and ii a warrant to purchase up to  shares of the national penn s common stock  without par value  at an initial exercise price  subject to anti dilution adjustments  of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
rules issued by treasury and certain provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of the recovery act require participating institutions  including national penn  to adopt certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which treasury holds cpp senior preferred stock 
under these standards  the amount of bonus and incentive compensation that may be paid each year is limited  incentive compensation must not be designed to encourage executives to take excessive risks or to manipulate earnings  bonuses and incentive compensation based on materially inaccurate financial statements must be returned  golden parachute payments are prohibited  and certain federal income tax deductions are limited 
these restrictions generally apply to the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and the next three most highly compensated executive officers but  in some instances  apply to a larger group of executives 
in addition  the american recovery and reinvestment act requires cpp participants to hold a non binding say on pay shareholder vote to approve the compensation of their executives 
participating institutions are also restricted from increasing their common stock dividend and from redeeming or repurchasing shares of their common stock while treasury owns the institution s senior preferred stock 
see dividend restrictions above 
these dividend restrictions and executive and corporate governance standards must remain in place for so long as treasury holds the cpp participant s senior preferred stock 
the american recovery and reinvestment act allows cpp participants  with the consent of treasury and the federal reserve  to redeem at any time the senior preferred stock sold to treasury 
upon the redemption of the senior preferred stock  the participant will no longer be required to comply with the dividend restrictions and executive compensation and corporate governance standards

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of national penn conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the financial services industry

risk factors variations in interest rates may negatively affect national penn s financial performance 
changes in interest rates may reduce profits 
the primary source of income for national penn is the differential  or the net interest spread  between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
as prevailing interest rates change  net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and re pricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
an increase in the general level of interest rates may also adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to repay their obligations 
in a declining interest rate environment  national penn may be unable to re price deposits downward in the same magnitude and or with the same timing as the movement in its interest sensitive assets 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates  whether upward or downward  could materially adversely affect national penn s net interest spread  loan origination volume  asset quality and overall profitability 
national penn s allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposure 
national penn depends on the creditworthiness of its customers 
national penn periodically reviews the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  considering economic conditions and trends  collateral values and credit quality indicators  including past charge off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets 
as a result of these considerations  national penn has from time to time increased its allowance for loan losses  most recently for the fourth quarter of  when it increased its provision for loan losses to million 
the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate over time to cover credit losses because of unanticipated adverse changes to the economy caused by recession  inflation  unemployment or other factors beyond national penn s control 
if the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases  if the risk profile of a market  industry or group of customers changes materially  or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate  national penn s business  financial condition  liquidity  capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely impact the value of national penn s investments 
national penn maintains an investment portfolio which includes  but is not limited to  municipal bonds and collateralized debt obligations 
the market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the issuer or composition of the bonds themselves  such as ratings downgrades  adverse changes in business climate and lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities 
national penn periodically  but not less than quarterly  evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
in conjunction with the third and fourth quarter of evaluations  national penn recorded after tax unrealized losses of million and million resulting from other than temporary impairment charges on collateralized debt obligations 
national penn may be required to record additional impairment charges if investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other than temporary 
if it is determined that a significant impairment has occurred  national penn would be required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset  which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
included in the investment portfolio is the approximately million in capital stock of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh that is owned by national penn 
the federal home loan bank is experiencing a potential capital shortfall  has suspended its quarterly cash dividend  and could possibly require its members  including national penn  to make additional capital investments in the home loan bank 
in order to avail itself of correspondent banking services offered by the home loan bank  national penn must continue to be a member  ie  a shareholder in the home loan bank 
should the home loan bank cease operations  write off of the home loan bank stock owned by national penn  and the loss of this liquidity source  could have material adverse effect on national penn s business  financial condition  liquidity  capital and results of operations 
national penn may incur impairments to goodwill 
national penn reviews its goodwill at least annually 
significant negative industry or economic trends  including the lack of recovery in the market place of national penn s common stock  reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to national penn s business  could indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
national penn s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely on projections of future operating performance 
national penn operates in competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results 
additionally  if national penn s analysis results in an impairment to its goodwill  national penn would be required to record a non cash charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist 
any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price 
national penn may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of recent transactions 
national penn s success depends on  among other things  national penn s ability to realize anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements from recent acquisitions  including the christiana and knbt mergers  and to combine the businesses of the acquired companies in a manner that permits growth without materially disrupting existing customer relationships or resulting in decreased revenues due to loss of customers 
if national penn is not able to successfully achieve these objectives  the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
additionally  if the integration efforts following acquisitions are not successfully managed  the failure of these integration efforts could result in loan losses  deposit attrition  operating costs  loss of key employees  disruption of national penn s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that adversely affect national penn s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or result in unanticipated losses 
the impact of recently enacted legislation and government programs to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time  and such legislation is subject to change 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
under eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  invest in financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
pursuant to this authority  the us treasury announced its capital purchase program the cpp  under which it is purchasing preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions  including national penn  to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy 
in accordance with the terms of the cpp  national penn issued to the us treasury shares of senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
participation in the cpp subjects national penn to increased oversight by the us treasury  regulators and congress 
the us treasury has issued rules implementing the eesa 
in addition to these rules  the american recovery and reinvestment act of contains executive compensation and corporate governance standards that apply to all cpp participants  including national penn 
for example  participation in the cpp restricts national penn s ability to increase dividends on its common stock and to repurchase its common stock 
in addition  the rules issued by the us treasury and the recovery act subject national penn to restrictions on executive compensation and require national penn to submit its executive compensation program to a non binding shareholder vote 
with regard to increased oversight  the us treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the cpp purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect national penn s corporate books and records through its federal banking regulator 
in addition  the us treasury has the right to appoint two directors to national penn s board if national penn misses dividend payments for six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  on the preferred stock 
we expect that future rulemaking under the eesa and the recovery act will be forthcoming from the us treasury which could impact our operations 
congress has held hearings on implementation of the cpp and the use of funds and may adopt further legislation impacting financial institutions that have obtained funding under the cpp or changing lending practices that legislators believe led to the current economic situation 
furthermore  the us treasury is required to issue rules interpreting and implementing the executive compensation provisions of the recovery act 
although it is unclear what  if any  additional legislation will be enacted into law or rules will be issued  certain laws or rules may be enacted or imposed administratively by the us treasury that could restrict national penn s operations or increase governmental oversight of its businesses and its corporate governance practices 
the special inspector general for tarp has requested information from tarp participants  including a description of past and anticipated uses of the tarp funds and plans for addressing executive compensation requirements under the cpp 
it is unclear at this point what the ramifications of such disclosure are or may be in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the actual impact that eesa  the recovery act and their implementing regulations  or any other governmental program  will have on the financial markets generally  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of the financial markets to stabilize and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect national penn s business  results of operations  financial condition  access to funding and the trading price of national penn s common stock 
governmental regulation  legislation and accounting industry pronouncements could adversely affect national penn 
in addition to the eesa  national penn and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive state and federal regulation  supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of the operations of national penn and its subsidiaries and change from time to time 
these laws and regulatory efforts are primarily intended for the protection of consumers  depositors and the government s deposit insurance funds and the accomplishment of governmental policy objectives such as combating terrorism  eg  the bank secrecy act 
in addition  national penn is subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations 
national penn cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in these areas or in their interpretations or applications will have on national penn 
any such changes may negatively affect national penn s financial performance  its ability to expand its products and services and or to increase the value of its business and  as a result  could be materially adverse to national penn s shareholders 
national penn s ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to regulatory limits 
national penn is a bank holding company 
its operations are conducted by direct and indirect subsidiaries  each of which is a separate and distinct legal entity 
substantially all of national penn s assets are held by its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
national penn s ability to pay dividends depends primarily on its receipt of dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
its principal bank subsidiary  national penn bank  which includes national penn bank s hometowne heritage bank  knbt bank  and nittany bank divisions  is national penn s primary source of dividends 
dividend payments from national penn bank and christiana are subject to legal and regulatory limitations  generally based on net profits and retained earnings  imposed by bank regulatory agencies 
the ability of national penn bank and christiana to pay dividends is also subject to profitability  financial condition  regulatory capital requirements  capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements 
there is no assurance that national penn bank  christiana and or national penn s other subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future or that national penn will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders in the future 
national penn s ability to pay dividends is also subject to limitations imposed by the terms of the cpp 
national penn s failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock 
competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect national penn s profitability 
national penn s subsidiaries face substantial competition in originating loans  both commercial and consumer 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of national penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
additionally  several of national penn s banking competitors have participated or may participate in the cpp and other government programs  which would subject national penn to more intense competition 
such competitors are large financial institutions that have received multi million or multi billion dollar infusions of capital from the us treasury or other support from federal programs  which has strengthened their balance sheets and enhanced their ability to withstand the uncertainty of the current economic environment 
this competition could reduce national penn s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that national penn s subsidiaries originate and the interest rates they may charge on these loans 
in attracting business and consumer deposits  national penn s subsidiaries face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of national penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources from participation in the cpp or otherwise  more aggressive marketing campaigns and better brand recognition and more branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than national penn  which could decrease the deposits that national penn attracts or require national penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect national penn s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  national penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase national penn s cost of funds 
national penn s banking and non banking subsidiaries also compete with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  insurance agencies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms 
some of national penn s non bank competitors are subject to less extensive regulations than those governing national penn s banking operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over national penn s banking and non banking subsidiaries in providing financial products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit national penn s margins on banking and non banking services  reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition 
national penn s subsidiaries face intense competition with various other financial institutions for the attraction and retention of key personnel  specifically those who generate and maintain national penn s customer relationships 
these competitors may not be subject to the limitations on executive compensation imposed under the eesa and the recovery act  may not be subject to federal taxation  and may offer greater compensation and other benefits  which could result in the loss of potential and or existing key personnel  including the loss of potential and or existing substantial customer relationships 
national penn s future information technology needs  developments and events may negatively affect national penn s financial performance and reputation 
effective and competitive delivery of national penn s products and services is increasingly dependent upon information technology resources and processes  both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables national penn to reduce costs 
national penn s future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations 
many of national penn s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
additionally  as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves  keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive for national penn  and national penn s need to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel becomes increasingly critical  particularly as national penn completes future acquisitions and enters into new markets 
there can be no assurance that national penn will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services  which could reduce its ability to effectively compete 
national penn operates in a legal and regulatory environment that generally seeks to minimize the risks for consumers and other product end users and protect their interests 
maintaining information security and dealing with any breach of information security  whether by national penn or by a third party  may be difficult and expensive 
national penn may be exposed to both financial and reputational risk if there is a compromise or loss of data  whether due to internal or external acts or omissions  and whether intentional or not  or if there is electronic fraud 
national penn s internal control systems are inherently limited 
national penn s system of internal controls  disclosure controls and corporate governance policies and procedures is inherently limited 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake and controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
because of the inherent limitation of a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected  which may have an adverse effect on national penn s business  results of operations or financial condition 
a warning about forward looking information this report  including information incorporated by reference in this report  contains forward looking statements about national penn and its subsidiaries 
in addition  from time to time  national penn or its representatives may make written or oral forward looking statements about national penn and its subsidiaries 
these forward looking statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for forward looking statements provided by the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are not statements of historical fact  and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believe  expect  may  will  should  project  plan  seek  target  intend or anticipate or the negative thereof or comparable terminology 
forward looking statements include discussions of strategy  financial projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions  statements regarding plans  objectives  expectations or consequences of various transactions  and statements about the future performance  operations  products and services of national penn and its subsidiaries 
national penn cautions its shareholders and other readers not to place undue reliance on such statements 
national penn s businesses and operations are and will be subject to a variety of risks  uncertainties and other factors 
consequently  actual results and experience may materially differ from those contained in any forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and experience to differ from those projected include  but are not limited to  the risk factors set forth above  as well as the following national penn s branding and marketing initiatives may not be effective in building name recognition and customer awareness of national penn s products and services 
national penn may be unable to differentiate itself from its competitors by a higher level of customer service  as intended by its business strategy and other marketing initiatives 
expansion of national penn s product and service offerings may take longer  and may meet with more effective competitive resistance from others already offering such products and services  than expected 
additionally  new product development by new and existing competitors may be more effective  and take place more quickly  than expected 
business development in newly entered geographic areas may be more difficult  present more operational and management risks and challenges  and take longer  than expected

the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the earnings performance of the company for the year ended december  and financial condition of the company as of december   with a primary focus on an analysis of operating results 
the financial statements presented include the results of christiana bank trust company christiana since its acquisition on january  and knbt bancorp  inc knbt since its acquisition on february  current performance does not guarantee and may not be indicative of similar performance in the future 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included in this report at item the company s strategic plan is designed to enhance shareholder value by operating a highly profitable financial services company within the markets it serves 
specifically  management is focused on increased market penetration in selected geographic areas  and achieving excellence in both retail and commercial lines of business 
the company also grows revenue through appropriate and targeted acquisitions through expanding into new geographical markets 
the acquisition of christiana and knbt in the first quarter of is representative of such a strategic initiative 
the current economic climate and interest rate environment present challenges for all financial institutions in achieving their business goals 
the company s financial performance is substantially affected by external factors beyond its control 
issues such as the length and severity of the deteriorating domestic economic climate  counterparty creditworthiness  the functioning and availability of liquidity in capital markets and consumer demand for products and services are all impacted by legislative and regulatory initiatives of the federal government 
in addition to historical information  this form k contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this document are subject to risks and uncertainty 
forward looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations by the company 
when we use words such as believe  expect  anticipate  or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
additional information concerning forward looking statements is contained in this report at item a 
risk factors  which is incorporated by reference into this management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and predominant practice within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered by management to be a critical accounting policy due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered 
the company continually reassesses the allowance and charges off uncollectible loans against the reserve when circumstances do not warrant continuance of the loan as a viable asset 
recoveries of assets previously written off  if any  are credited to the allowance for credit losses account 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan and lease losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss in event of default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows or collateral liquidation values on impaired loans  mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
although goodwill is not subject to amortization  the company must test the carrying value for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of our reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets  including goodwill 
our reporting units were identified based upon an analysis of each of our individual operating segments 
a reporting unit is defined as any distinct  separately identifiable component of an operating segment for which complete  discrete financial information is available that management regularly reviews 
we allocated goodwill to each reporting unit based on its relative fair value at the time of the related acquisition 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to use a high degree of subjectivity 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value  an expense may be required on the company s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill as of june each year  and again at any quarter end if any material events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill 
for this testing  the company retained a third party valuation firm to perform a step one test for potential goodwill impairment 
the company and the valuation firm determined that the income approach and the market approach were most appropriate in determining whether a step two test for impairment was necessary 
the income approach uses a dividend discount analysis 
this approach calculates cash flows based on anticipated financial results assuming a change of control transaction 
this change of control assumes that an acquirer will achieve an expected base level of earnings  achieve integration cost savings and incur certain transaction costs including such items as legal and financial advisors fees  contract cancellations  severance and employment obligations  and other transaction costs 
the analysis then calculates the present value of all excess cash flows generated by the company above the minimum tangible capital ratio plus the present value of a terminal sale value 
the market approach is used to calculate the fair value of a company by calculating median pricing multiples in recent actual acquisitions of companies similarly sized and then applying these multiples to the community banking segment 
this technique uses historical data to create a current pricing level and is thus a trailing indicator 
results provided by the market approach need to be understood in this context 
it is believed that the current turmoil in the financial markets is recent and has not yet fully impacted pricing levels of acquisitions 
impairment testing for for goodwill and intangibles was completed at june  by our outside consultant 
at that time there was no indication or determination of goodwill or intangible impairment at national penn 
notwithstanding the significant disruptions in the financial markets  as well as national penn s recording of significant other than temporary impairment charges on investments during the third and fourth quarters of  management re affirms the original findings by the consultant 
management has determined that there is no change at december  to the june finding of no impairment of goodwill or intangibles 
this conclusion is based on several factors 
first  there was no sustained drop in npbc stock price below national penn s tangible book value during the last two quarters of second  the integrations of knbt and christiana were completed successfully  and the resulting new national penn continues to grow and add new business 
third  while the economic situation has resulted in elevated non performing loans  national penn continues to compare favorably in this area versus its peers 
there is no indication that there were elevated credit problems at either knbt or christiana 
lastly  the other than temporary impairment charges incurred by national penn are due to disruptions in the financial markets and do not reflect on the success of the acquisitions that generated the goodwill and intangibles 
no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings the company also uses judgment in the valuation of other intangible assets 
a core deposit base intangible asset has been recorded for core deposits defined as checking  money market and savings deposits that were acquired in acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
the core deposit base intangible asset has been recorded using the assumption that the acquired deposits provide a more favorable source of funding than more expensive wholesale borrowings 
an intangible asset has been recorded for the present value of the difference between the expected interest to be incurred on these deposits and interest expense that would be expected if these deposits were replaced by wholesale borrowings  over the expected lives of the core deposits 
if the analysis concludes these deposits have a shorter life than was estimated  then the company will write down the asset by expensing the amount that is impaired 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that the company may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
as of january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  using the modified retrospective method 
fas r requires that the company measure and recognize compensation expense for share based compensation  based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option grant under the company s share based compensation plans is estimated using the black sholes option pricing model based on various estimates and assumptions  including expected volatility  expected dividends  expected terms  expected forfeitures and the risk free rates associated with the awards 
all of these estimates and assumptions may be susceptible to significant change that may impact earnings in future periods 
the company periodically reviews its investment portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses are temporary  based on an evaluation of the creditworthiness of the issuers guarantors as well as the underlying collateral  if applicable  in addition to the continuing performance of the securities 
management also evaluates other facts and circumstances that may be indicative of an other than temporary impairment otti condition 
this includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of the type of security and length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost as well as certain collateral related characteristics 
the company contracted with a third party advisory firm to provide an additional collateralized debt obligation cdo valuation 
all aspects of the securities were examined including the basic tranche seniority subordination  cash flow waterfall mechanics  overcollateralization tests and interest coverage tests 
in addition  assumptions surrounding deferral or defaults were examined  as well as the probability that these events happen in the future 
discount rate assumptions were intended to reflect the uncertainty inherent to their projections of bond cash flows 
the discount rate selected was comparable to spreads observed currently in the market for similarly rated cdo instruments  specifically high yield collateralized loan obligations  and was intended to reflect general market discounts currently being applied to structured credit products 
during  the company owned a portfolio of cdos which included a synthetic cdo as well as bank and insurance company pooled trust preferred investments 
due to the impact of the economic climate  the company has closely monitored key aspects of the acquired tranches 
through the monthly evaluations  the securities were assigned into one of six classes dependent upon the tranche s analytics such as overcollateralization tests and interest capitalization analyses 
prior to third quarter  otti was deemed not present pursuant to the testing results 
at the end of third quarter  the company recognized otti on its only synthetic cdo 
at that time  all other cdo securities were deemed performing in the analytics 
subsequently though  at the end of fourth quarter  otti was recognized on a portion of the bank and insurance company pooled trust preferred investments due to the continued deterioration of the financial services industry 
financial condition at december   total assets were billion  an increase of billion or from the billion at december  the increase in assets in was primarily the effect of the result of the acquisition of billion and million in assets acquired from knbt and christiana  respectively 
total assets at the end of increased million or to billion over the billion at year end the increase in assets in is reflected primarily in the net loan and lease category  and the investments category  which increased million  and million  respectively 
loan portfolio net loans and leases  including loans held for sale  increased to billion during  an increase of billion or compared to the growth was primarily due to the increase of billion in loans acquired from knbt and continued strength in the commercial loan portfolio which increased by approximately million since the second quarter management targets loan percentage growth in the low to mid single digits for all of the company had million in loans held for sale at december  as compared with million at december  the company s loans are widely diversified by borrower  industry group  and geographical area in the company s market areas

in situations where a renewal is appropriate  the company s policy in this regard is to evaluate the credit for collectibility consistent with the normal loan evaluation process 
this policy is used primarily in evaluating ongoing customers use of their lines of credit that are at floating interest rates 
risk elements loans a loan is placed in a non accrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
loans past due are those loans which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans are those loans with terms that have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower

the categories of loans that comprised the december  balance of non performing assets were commercial and industrial loans  million  commercial real estate  million  residential mortgages  million and consumer loans  million 
the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing assets was and at december  and  respectively 
another measure of the company s credit quality is reflected by the ratio of net charge offs to average total loans and leases of for versus for  and the ratio of non performing assets to total loans of at december  compared to at december  additional discussion regarding non performing assets is set forth in the paragraph of this item titled allowance for loan and lease losses 
investment portfolio the investment portfolio is primarily a secondary source of liquidity  but it also serves as a source of income 
as such  the investment portfolio consists of shorter term investments that provide current liquidity and longer term investments that provide higher income 
securities include us treasury  us government agency and government sponsored agencies  municipal and corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  trust preferred pools and marketable equity securities 
the company can classify its securities among three categories held to maturity  trading  and available for sale 
management determines the appropriate classification of the company s securities at the time of purchase 
held to maturity securities are limited to debt securities for which management has the intent and the company has the ability to hold to maturity 
these securities are reported at amortized cost 
trading securities are debt and equity securities held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
these securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
the company does not engage in security trading activities 
all other debt and marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of the related deferred income tax effect excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
available for sale securities include securities that management intends to hold for an indefinite period of time  such as securities to be used as part of the company s asset liability management strategy or securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks  the need to increase capital  or similar factors 
premiums and discounts on debt securities are recognized in interest income on a level yield basis over the period to maturity 
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on mortgage backed securities are based on the estimated cash flows of the mortgage backed securities  periodically adjusted for changes in estimated lives  on a level yield basis 
premiums and discounts on state and municipal securities are amortized or accreted on a straight line basis to maturity 
the cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method 
unrealized losses are charged to earnings when management determines that the decline in fair value of a security is other than temporary 
securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired are permanently written down from their original cost basis to reflect the adjusted fair value subsequent to a measurement for impairment 
the impairment is deemed other than temporary if there is serious credit concern regarding a particular debt issuer  or severe fluctuation in interest rates 
the other than temporary adjustment is charged to current earnings in the period of measurement 
declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
regardless of classification as to shorter term or longer term  the majority of the company s investments are readily marketable securities held as available for sale  and the majority of the company s investments qualify as collateral for deposit pledging needs 
investments of both held to maturity and available for sale increased million or to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the primary reason for the increase was the addition of million in securities from the knbt acquisition 
during the second quarter  national penn reclassified its cdo investments  which includes bank and insurance company pools of trust preferred debt and one synthetic cdo  from available for sale to held to maturity 
this action reflects the company s intent to hold these investments to maturity 
the increase in investment of both held to maturity and available for sale securities was partially offset by the company s taking a million pre tax other than temporary impairment charge on the investment in a synthetic collateralized debt obligation 
this occurred during the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company took a non cash other than temporary impairment pretax charge of million on cdo investments in pooled trust preferred securities

net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them  respectively 
interest income for the year ended december  increased to million  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due a higher level of interest earning assets attributable to the acquisitions of christiana and knbt 
the increase in interest income was partially offset by declines in general market interest rates on earning assets and the non cash other than temporary impairment on cdos 
average interest earning assets for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of billion  or  over average interest earning assets for the year ended december  of billion 
average loan balances grew by billion and average balances of investments increased by million 
on a tax equivalent basis  average yields on interest earning assets decreased by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the federal open market committee of the federal reserve board slashed the target federal funds rate from at january  to a range of to by the end of while this allowed the company to lower interest costs  it also had a negative impact on asset yields 
rates on variable rate and adjustable rate loans fell and new loans were originated at lower rates than those maturing 
interest income on loans for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the prior year 
interest income on commercial loans and lease financing for the year ended december  increased to million  from million for the primary reason for the increase was average balances of commercial loans and lease financing grew billion to billion due to the aforementioned acquisition of christiana and knbt 
the increase in interest income was partially offset by the decline in market rates during interest income on installment loans increased by million  to as compared to million earned in income earned on mortgage loans was million for the year ended december   up million from the prior year 
tax equivalent interest income on securities and other earning assets increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million to million  an increase of compared to interest expense of million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to a higher level of interest bearing liabilities obtained through the acquisitions of christiana and knbt 
the increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the year ended december  of compared to in the average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the prior year 
furthermore  this average cost of borrowings decreased basis points which reflects the general market conditions during net interest income for the fiscal year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the net interest margin on a full taxable equivalent basis increased by basis points to 
a primary reason for the increase was the acquisition of knbt which resulted in fair value adjustments to loans and deposits during to reflect a market rate of return on those acquired assets and liabilities 
the adjustments were accreted during the year and resulted in increases to net interest margin amounting to basis points 
partially offsetting the increase in gross margin was the fact that yields on earning assets declined at a faster pace than yields on interest bearing liabilities 
the decline in average cost of liabilities occurs at a slower pace due to the asset liability mix of the company s balance sheet 
net interest income increased million or to million in from the amount of million 
interest income increased million or to million in  as compared to million in  as a result of an increase in loan interest income of million and an increase in investment securities interest income of million 
interest expense in increased million or to million from the amount of million due to an increase in interest on deposits of million  an increase in interest on long term borrowings of million  and an increase in expense for securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased of  the increase in interest expense on deposits is due primarily to an increase in the volume of interest bearing deposits and the average rate paid on these deposits in the increase in interest expense on borrowings is a result of an increase in the average balance of borrowings outstanding during offset by a decrease in the overall average rate on borrowings

the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the increase related to higher outstanding balances and that due to the levels and volatility of interest rates

net interest margin is net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 
during  net interest margin was  compared to during and during allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is determined by periodic reviews of loan quality  current economic conditions  loss experience and loan growth 
based on these factors  the provision for loan and lease losses was million  million and million for the year ended december    and respectively 
the allowance for loan and lease losses of million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans was at year end and at year end net loan charge offs increased to million in  compared to net loan charge offs of million in and million in management continues to believe its loan loss allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the current portfolio

loans to individuals are charged off any time repayment is deemed highly unlikely or as soon as the loan becomes days delinquent 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
management conducts a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio which includes any loan designated as having a high risk profile including but not limited to  loans classified as substandard or doubtful as defined by regulation  loans criticized internally or designated as special mention  delinquencies  expirations  overdrafts  loans to customers having experienced recent operating losses and loans identified by management as impaired 
the analysis is performed to determine the amount which would be adequate to absorb probable losses contained in the loan portfolio and results in the adjustment of the allowance for loan and lease losses alll 
the analytical process is regularly reviewed and adjustments may be made based on the assessments of internal and external influences on credit quality 
during analyses of the alll  a variety of factors were considered  some of which included general economic conditions  trends in charge offs for each loan type  the level of nonperforming assets  including loans over days delinquent and impaired loans  the level of delinquent loans  a review of portfolio concentration  industry and loan type  and levels of criticized and classified loans 
the following table shows the composition of the allowance for loan and lease losses dollars in thousands specific reserves allocated reserves unallocated reserves the following table shows asset quality indicators for the periods presented dollars in thousands non performing loans non performing loans to total loans delinquent loans excluding non performing loans delinquent loans to total loans classified loans classisfied loans to total loans tier capital and alll classified loans to tier capital and alll total loans specific reserve the first element of the alll is an estimation of losses specific to individual impaired loans 
in this process  specific reserves are established based on an analysis of the most probable sources of repayment including liquidation of collateral or the market value of the loan itself 
the specific allowances related to impaired loans are set forth in the previous table detailing the components of the alll 
specific reserves have historically represented a small component of the overall reserve  and fluctuate based on changes in the underlying loans and charge offs 
allocated reserve the second element of the alll  the allocated reserves  represents a general allowance for loan pools where the loans are not individually evaluated  though rated according to a ten point quality matrix 
this amount is determined by applying loss factors to pools of loans within the portfolio having similar risk characteristics 
the allocated reserves are determined using a baseline factor that is an average of the rolling twelve month net charge off ratios over the past five years multiplied by the average life of each pool of loans 
prior to the company used a rolling eight quarter chargeoff experience to create the baseline factor 
adjustments may be made to baseline factors for some or all pools based on the assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
these may include elements such as changes in credit underwriting  concentration risk and or other recent observable asset quality trends  as well as an assessment of current economic conditions 
the company evaluates the alll methodology for appropriate enhancements 
during the third quarter of the company made adjustments to its methodology which added quantitative factors to the measurements of these internal and external influences which resulted in a redistribution of the allocated and unallocated reserves 
specifically  the way in which environmental factors are quantified was reviewed and adjusted causing a reduction in allocated reserves and an increase in the unallocated reserves without changing the overall level of reserves 
it is likely that the methodology will continue to evolve over time 
allocated reserves are presented in the previous table detailing the components of the alll 
allocated reserves result from a combination of historical charge offs and an assessment of the current environment  which for the periods of through  reflect a relatively low and stable level of net charge off activity 
during  charge off activity was largely dominated by two loans charged off for a total of million 
the year was characterized by an economic downturn which has resulted in the failure of businesses and the devaluation of assets as real estate values have fallen and many companies have been forced to liquidate 
this is reflected in the allocated reserve as problem loans are recognized as soon as possible and classified accordingly 
the provision for loan losses of million in was of total net charged off balances of million 
the levels of delinquency  non performing loans  and classified loans are presented in the table above these are primary factors in the determination of the alll as described previously 
when compared to total loans  non performing loans have represented between and over the periods presented in the table 
at the end of  non performing loans were million or of total loans as compared to of total loans at the end of a total of million in non performing loans were added as a result of the acquisitions of christiana bank and trust and knbt 
delinquent loans have represented between and of total loans during the periods presented 
these loans are considered performing and exclude nonaccrual loans and loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest all of which are considered non performing 
since delinquency often precedes charge off  and delinquent loans are reviewed for possible risk classification changes  the alll is sensitive to increases in this category 
delinquent loan balances increased in from million to million and from of total loans in to at the end of delinquent loans added through acquisitions in were million 
classified loan balances have a direct impact on the alll  specifically the allocated reserves 
from to current  classified loans represented between and of total loans 
as of december   after including million in classified loans from the two acquisitions  classified loans relative to total loans amounted to in recognition of the increased risk associated with real estate development projects and evidence that borrowers have experienced the effects of an economic slow down 
classified loans are identified as soon as possible and monitored with efforts to reduce the portion which ultimately results in non performing or charged off balances 
management also finds it relevant to compare classified loans to tier capital  including the alll 
the ratio increased from at year end to at year end which reflects a higher level of classified loans offset by increased capital resulting from earnings and the infusion from the issuance of preferred stock 
unallocated reserve the third element of the alll is the unallocated reserve that addresses inherent probable losses not included elsewhere in the alll 
the increase in the unallocated portion of the reserve was due to the modification in methodology previously described above under the allocated reserve section 
the unallocated reserve supports uncertainties within the following portfolios real estate portfolio  particularly residential tract development 
given the continued declines in the residential housing market  it s probable that the company will experience credit performance problems in this portfolio as established interest reserves are exhausted and collateral values decline 
consumer portfolio  specifically our home equity portfolio 
as home prices decline the collateral coverage the company has for its junior lien position credits will decline so the loss experience is likely to increase 
the company considers overall adequacy subsequent to acquisitions 
historical factors have been updated where appropriate to reflect the relevant experience of the acquired portfolios prior to the merger 
that experience was reflected in the provision for loan losses made in for all other periods presented  no substantive previous changes were made to the way in which historical loss information was used 
as noted  the year was also affected by the two acquisitions  knbt and christiana  completed during the year  which collectively added million to the alll  million in non performing loans  million in classified loans  and billion in total loan balances 
charge offs and classifications in reflect the deterioration of economic conditions and resulting failure of businesses  devaluation of assets and negative impact on consumer s ability to service debt 
specifically  as operating companies experience a reduction in revenues and real estate companies have experienced an inability to liquidate assets at expected prices in the time frame anticipated  both have realized losses and cash flow deficiencies and the inability to maintain current debt service 
this triggers a review of possible  commercially reasonable  disposition of collateral as the net realizable value of the loan and recognition of an appropriate classification and corresponding provision to the allowance for loan losses 
the company has identified and acted on potentially impaired loans expeditiously  and considers the allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans and leases at december  appropriately positioned based on its review of overall credit quality indicators and ongoing loan monitoring processes 
the company recognizes  however  that if economic conditions continue to deteriorate and consumers  businesses and real estate entities suffer further  addition losses may result in the loan portfolio

non interest income and expenses for the year ended december   non interest income totaled million  a million or decrease over the million reported for the comparable period 
this decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned non cash other than temporary impairment charge of million in the decrease was partially offset by increases in wealth management income  insurance commissions and fees  service charges on deposit accounts and an increase in net gains from fair value changes 
for the twelve months ending december   wealth management income increased million or  insurance commissions and fees increased million or and service charges on deposit accounts increased million or over the comparable period in the increase in additional wealth management revenues was a result of the acquisitions of christiana and to a lesser extent knbt 
these acquisitions substantially increased the amount of assets under management 
the primary reason for the increase in insurance commissions and fees was the acquisition of the caruso benefits group and higgins insurance  subsidiaries of knbt 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts increase was primarily due to the increased number of accounts due to the acquisitions of knbt and christiana 
non interest income increased million or in compared to  primarily as a result of a million increase in wealth management income  and a million increase in other operating income due primarily to a gain of million for the change in fair value of the company s subordinated debt related to npb capital trust ii trust preferred securities which are subject to fair market valuation under fasb no

the increase was primarily the result of an addition of approximately additional community banking offices due to the acquisition of christiana and knbt 
other operating expenses totaled million  an increase of million or for the twelve months ended december  over the increase was primarily the result of increases in outside services expenses  communication expense  fdic insurance expense and increased amortization of newly added intangible assets due to the christiana and knbt acquisitions 
in addition  the million employee fraud loss contributed to the increase in non interest expense 
non interest expenses increased million or in compared to  as a result of increased salaries  wages and benefits of million  occupancy expense of million and an increase in non recurring expenses

liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s board of directors has set general liquidity guidelines for management to meet  which can be summarized as  the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the demand from depositors who wish to withdraw funds  borrowers who require funds  and capital expansion 
liquidity is produced by cash flows from our operating  investing  and financing activities 
liquidity needs generally arise from asset originations and deposit outflows 
liquidity needs can increase when asset origination of loans and investments exceeds net deposit inflows 
conversely  liquidity needs are reduced when the opposite occurs 
in these instances  the needs are funded through short term borrowings  while excess liquidity is sold into the federal funds market 
the company employs a diverse capital raising strategy which may include acquisition of additional equity capital 
during  the company completed the sale of its senior preferred stock totaling million to the us department of the treasury under its tarp capital purchase program

us treasury also received warrants to purchase  shares of national penn common stock at an exercise price of per share

optional cash contributions may now be made in amounts up to  per month  an increase from the prior monthly limitation of  in addition  the company announced in  that it has filed a universal automatic shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec 
the shelf registration statement permits national penn  from time to time  to sell  in one or more public offerings  shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units  or any combination of such securities 
the terms of any such future offerings would be established at the time of the offering 
the company s largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from our retail and corporate and institutional banking activities 
the company also utilizes wholesale funding that comes from a diverse mix of short and long term funding sources 
wholesale funding is defined here as funding sources outside our core deposit base  such as correspondent bank borrowings including the federal reserve bank of philadelphia frb or brokered cds 
in  the company opted into the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
this program provides unlimited deposit insurance for non interest bearing transaction accounts  as well as an opportunity for fdic guaranteed unsecured borrowing 
the program expires december  the company s principal source of day to day liquidity is through wholesale  secured borrowing lines from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb and the frb  details of which are set out in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
during most of the year  we have accessed both of these lines to provide funds for asset growth in excess of deposit growth 
at no time during the year did we experience any difficulties accessing these lines 
the liquidity and credit crises faced by many financial and commercial institutions have not negatively affected our company 
we have funds available to us  and have had no problem accessing them at reasonable rates 
however  regardless of our comfort with our liquidity position at the present time  we actively monitor our position and any increased use of wholesale funding increases our attention in this area 
as measured using the consolidated statement of cash flows  for the year ended december   the company provided million in net cash and equivalents versus providing  in net cash provided by operating activities was million in and million in and million in during  the company experienced non cash other than temporary impairment charges of million and increased loan provision by million to million from million in cash used by investing activities in increased to million from million in  while cash used in was million 
net cash used for loans and leases increased in by million compared to  while in  net cash used for lending activities decreased by million compared to this increase in was fueled by commercial loan demand in spite of the economic environment 
the growth in was a result of our continued commitment to funding the credit needs of our community  even as other banks in our footprint reduced lending 
the decline in from was management driven to ensure we originated loans at profitable rates and maturities 
given the flat to inverted slope of the yield curve for most of and  we were unwilling to add longer term fixed rate assets to our balance sheet unless they were accretive to net interest margin 
the slope of the yield curve had improved later in and into early in  we expect modest growth in net loan originations despite a weakened economy 
cash provided by financing activities was million in versus million in and million in the largest source of financing funds in and was customer deposits 
additional proceeds from long term borrowings were a significant source in also in  the company completed the sale of its senior preferred stock totaling million to the us department of the treasury under its tarp capital purchase program 
in the transaction  the us treasury purchased  shares of newly issued  non voting national penn senior preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of million and an initial annual dividend of 
although the company filed a universal automatic shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec  the company anticipates financing to be provided by a mix of deposits and overnight borrowings 
the company expects deposit growth to come from consumer and business deposits 
the company s acquisitions of knbt and christiana were completed in first quarter for further information  see footnote to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
upon consummation of the knbt merger  the company merged knbt s bank subsidiary  keystone nazareth bank trust co  into the company s principal bank subsidiary  national penn bank  and now operates the merged bank as a separate division  retaining its name and management 
the company now operates christiana as a separate subsidiary  retaining its name and management 
accordingly  in each case  the company expects no material run off of deposits over the long term and as a result  does not anticipate a negative material impact on the company s overall long term liquidity position 
the company s biggest source of revenue is net interest income 
therefore  interest rate risk management is an important function 
interest rate risk is the company s most significant market based risk 
the company realizes net interest income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
loan volumes and yields  as well as the volume and rates on investments  deposits and borrowings  are affected by market interest rates 
additionally  because of the terms and conditions of many of our loans and deposit accounts  a change in interest rates could also affect the projected maturities of the loan portfolio and or the deposit base  which could alter our sensitivity to future changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk management focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits while taking into consideration  among other factors  overall credit risk  operating income  operating costs  and available capital 
the company s asset liability committee alco includes the company s president and senior officers in various disciplines including treasury  finance  commercial lending  retail lending  and sales 
a member of the board of directors  on a rotating basis  attends alco meetings 
the committee reports to the board on its activities to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
management of interest rate risk leads us to select certain techniques and instruments to utilize after considering the benefits  costs and risks associated with available alternatives 
we usually consider one or more of the following interest rates offered on products  maturity terms offered on products  types of products offered  and products available to us in the wholesale market such as advances from the fhlb and brokered time deposits 
alco s principal focus is net interest income at risk 
the company utilizes a net interest margin shock simulation model as one method to identify and manage our interest rate risk profile 
the model measures projected net interest income at risk and anticipated resulting changes in net income and economic value of equity 
the model is based on expected cash flows and repricing characteristics for all financial instruments at a point in time and incorporates our market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on these financial instruments over a twelve month period 
the company also incorporates assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
while actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  this model has proven to be an important guidance tool for alco 
the following table sets forth the results of this model for the company  the principal entity exposed to market risk  at december  the following table shows separately the interest rate sensitivity of each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  re pricing periods dollars in thousands three within months one year over three through through five months one year five years years interest earning assets interest bearing deposits at banks federal funds sold investment securities loans and leases total interest earning assets cumulative total interest earning assets liabilities and equity interest bearing deposits borrowed funds subordinated debt total interest bearing liabilities cumulative total interest bearing liabilities interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the expected prepayments in the interest rate environment prevailing during the most recent calendar quarter 
the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will re price at contractual re pricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
savings and now deposits are scheduled for re pricing immediately 
time deposits are included in the period in which they are expected to mature 
includes federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and short and long term borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of the repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
based on the company s gap position as reflected in the above table  current accepted theory would indicate that net interest income would increase in a falling rate environment and would decrease in a rising rate environment 
an interest rate gap table does not  however  present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
for example  non interest bearing deposits are assigned a repricing interval within three months  although history indicates a significant amount of these deposits will not move into interest bearing categories regardless of the general level of interest rates 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation of the economic value of equity 
this report forecasts changes in the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe under alternative interest rate environments 
the mvpe is defined as the net present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in mvpe at december  are as follows dollars in thousands mvpe change in interest rate amount change basis points basis points basis points flat rate basis points basis points basis points management also estimates the potential effect of shifts in interest rates on net income 
the following table demonstrates the expected effect that a parallel interest rate shift would have on the company s net income dollars in thousands december  december  change change change change change in in net in net in net in net interest rates income income income income in basis points the company uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity 
alco approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging 
the derivatives employed by the company currently include forward sales of mortgage commitments  as well as fair value and cash flow hedges 
the company does not use any of these instruments for trading purposes 
for details of derivatives  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report at item at the current level of interest rates  the company has some exposure to a movement in rising rates due to the amount of repriceable liabilities in the short term and the optionality of the financial instruments on both sides of the balance sheet 
optionality exists because customers have choices regarding their deposit accounts or loans 
for example  if a customer has a fixed rate mortgage  he she may choose to refinance the mortgage if interest rates decline 
one way to reduce this option risk is to sell the company s long term fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market 
the impact of a rising or falling interest rate environment on net interest income is not expected to be significant to the company s results of operations 
nonetheless  the company s asset liability management committee s priority is to manage this optionality and therefore limit the level of interest rate risk
