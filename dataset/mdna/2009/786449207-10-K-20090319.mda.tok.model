principles of accounting for ownership interests in partner companies we account for our interests in our partner companies and private equity funds using three methods consolidation  equity or cost 
the accounting method applied is generally determined by the degree of our influence over the entity  primarily determined by on our voting interest in the entity 
consolidation method 
we account for our partner companies in which we directly or indirectly own more than of the outstanding voting securities using the consolidation method of accounting 
we reflect the participation of other partner company stockholders in the income or losses of our consolidated partner companies as minority interest in the consolidated statements of operations 
minority interest adjusts our consolidated operating results to reflect only our share of the earnings or losses of the consolidated partner companies 
if there is no minority interest balance remaining on the consolidated balance sheets related to the respective partner company  we record of the consolidated partner company s losses  we record of subsequent earnings of the partner company to the extent of such previously recognized losses in excess of our proportionate share 

table of contents equity method 
we account for partner companies whose results are not consolidated  but over whom we exercise significant influence  using the equity method of accounting 
we also account for our interests in some private equity funds under the equity method of accounting  depending on our respective general and limited partner interests 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of the income or loss of the company is reflected in equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
we report our share of the income or loss of the equity method partner companies on a one quarter lag 
when the carrying value of our holding in an equity method partner company is reduced to zero  no further losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations unless we have outstanding guarantee obligations or have committed additional funding to the equity method partner company 
when the equity method partner company subsequently reports income  we will not record our share of such income until it equals the amount of our share of losses not previously recognized 
cost method 
we account for partner companies which are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method using the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method  our share of the income or losses of such partner companies is not included in our consolidated statements of operations 
however  the effect of the change in market value of cost method partner company holdings classified as trading securities is reflected in other income loss  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
these judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly important because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill impairment  impairment of ownership interests in and advances to companies  income taxes  commitments and contingencies  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition during  and  our revenue from continuing operations was attributable to clarient 
revenue for clarient s diagnostic testing and interpretive services is recognized at the time of completion of such services 
clarient s services are billed to various payors  including medicare  health insurance companies and other directly billed healthcare institutions and patients 
clarient reports revenue from contracted payors  including certain health insurance companies and healthcare institutions  based on the contracted rate or  in certain instances  clarient s estimate of such rate 
for billings to medicare  clarient utilizes the published fee schedules  net of standard discounts commonly referred to as contractual allowances 
clarient reports revenue from non contracted payors  including certain insurance companies and patients  based on the amount expected to be collected for services provided 
adjustments resulting from actual collections compared to clarient s estimates are recognized in the period realized 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for estimated uncollectible amounts due from various payor groups such as medicare and private health insurance companies 
the process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with clarient s diagnostic services involves significant assumptions and judgments 
specifically  the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted periodically  based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience 
clarient also reviews the age of receivables by payor class to assess its allowance at each period end 
the payment realization cycle for certain governmental and managed care payors can be lengthy  involving denial  appeal and adjudication processes  and is subject to periodic adjustments that may be significant 
accounts receivable are periodically written off when identified as uncollectible and deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to bad debt expense within selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets we test long lived assets  including property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
we evaluate the recoverability of an asset by comparing its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount  we measure any impairment loss as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the carrying value of net property and equipment at december  was million 
impairment of goodwill we conduct an annual review for impairment of goodwill as of december st and as otherwise required by circumstances or events 
additionally  on an interim basis  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or a decline in a company s stock price for a sustained period 
we test for impairment at a reporting unit level which for us is the same as an operating segment 
if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we assess whether goodwill of the reporting unit is impaired 
to determine fair value  we use a number of valuation methods including quoted market prices  discounted cash flows  valuations of comparable public companies and valuations of acquisitions of comparable companies 
depending on the complexity of the valuation and the significance of the carrying value of the goodwill to the consolidated financial statements  we may engage an outside valuation firm to assist us in determining fair value 
as an overall check on the reasonableness of the fair values attributed to our reporting units  we will consider comparing the aggregate fair values for all reporting units with our average total market capitalization for a reasonable period of time 
the carrying value of goodwill at december  was million and relates entirely to our clarient segment 
based on quoted market prices of clarient s common stock  the fair value of our holdings in clarient exceeds its carrying value  inclusive of goodwill 
our partner companies operate in industries which are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
while we believe that the current recorded carrying value of our goodwill is not impaired  there can be no assurance that a significant write down or write off will not be required in the future 

table of contents impairment of ownership interests in and advances to companies on a periodic basis but no less frequently than at the end of each quarter we evaluate the carrying value of our equity and cost method partner companies for possible impairment based on achievement of business plan objectives and milestones  the financial condition and prospects of the company  market conditions  and other relevant factors 
the business plan objectives and milestones we consider include  among others  those related to financial performance  such as achievement of planned financial results or completion of capital raising activities  and those that are not primarily financial in nature  such as hiring of key employees or the establishment of strategic relationships 
we then determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of our ownership interest in the company 
impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of privately held partner companies is generally determined based on the value at which independent third parties have invested or have committed to invest in these companies or based on other valuation methods  including discounted cash flows  valuations of comparable public companies and valuations of acquisitions of comparable companies 
the fair value of our ownership interests in private equity funds is generally determined based on the value of our pro rata portion of the funds net assets and estimated future proceeds from sales of investments provided by the funds managers 
the new carrying value of a partner company is not increased if circumstances suggest the value of the partner company has subsequently recovered 
our partner companies operate in industries which are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of the carrying value of ownership interests in and advances to companies could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
while we believe that the current recorded carrying values of our equity and cost method companies are not impaired  there can be no assurance that our future results will confirm this assessment or that a significant write down or write off will not be required in the future 
total impairment charges related to ownership interests in and advances to our equity and cost method partner companies were as follows year ended december  accounting method in millions equity cost total impairment charges related to equity method partner companies are included in equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment charges related to cost method partner companies are included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future years 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

table of contents commitments and contingencies from time to time  we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions which arise in the normal course of business 
additionally  we have received distributions as both a general partner and a limited partner from certain private equity funds 
in certain circumstances  we may be required to return a portion or all the distributions we received as a general partner of a fund for a further distribution to such fund s limited partners the clawback 
we are also a guarantor of various third party obligations and commitments and are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business see note 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of provision required for these commitments and contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
changes in the provision could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made 
stock based compensation as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  prior to january   we accounted for employee stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  we recorded no compensation expense for stock options issued to employees at fair market value 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
accordingly  we have not restated prior period amounts 
under this application  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the expected term of the award and the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term 
changes in these assumptions and in the estimated forfeitures of stock option awards can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the requisite service periods for market based stock option awards are based on our estimate of the dates on which the market conditions will be met as determined using a monte carlo simulation model 
changes in the derived requisite service period or achievement of market capitalization targets earlier than estimated can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the requisite service periods for performance based awards are based on our best estimate of when the performance conditions will be met 
compensation expense is recognized for performance based awards for which the performance condition is considered probable of achievement 
changes in the requisite service period or the estimated probability of achievement of performance conditions can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations during the third quarter  we increased our ownership interest in authentium to the threshold at which we believe we exercise significant influence 
accordingly  we adopted the equity method of accounting for our holdings in authentium 
we have adjusted the financial statements for prior periods contained in this form k to retrospectively apply the equity method of accounting for our holdings in authentium since the initial date of acquisition in april on may   we consummated a transaction the bundle transaction pursuant to which we sold all of our equity and debt interests in acsis  inc acsis  alliance consulting group associates  inc 
alliance consulting  laureate pharma  inc laureate pharma  promodel corporation promodel and neuronyx  inc neuronyx collectively  the bundle companies 
of the companies included in the bundle transaction  acsis  alliance consulting and laureate pharma were majority owned partner companies  neuronyx and promodel were minority owned partner companies 
we have presented the results of operations of acsis  alliance consulting and laureate pharma as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

table of contents we present clarient  our publicly traded consolidated partner company  as a separate segment 
the results of operations of our other partner companies in which we have less than a majority interest are reported in our life sciences and technology segments 
the life sciences and technology segments also include the gain or loss on the sale of respective partner companies  except for gains and losses included in discontinued operations 
our management evaluates the clarient segment s performance based on revenue  operating income loss and income loss before income taxes  which reflects the portion of income loss allocated to minority shareholders 
our management evaluates the life sciences and technology segments performance based on equity income loss which is based on the number of partner companies accounted for under the equity method  our voting ownership percentage in these partner companies and the net results of operations of these partner companies and other income or loss associated with cost method partner companies 
other items include certain expenses  which are not identifiable to the operations of our operating business segments 
other items primarily consist of general and administrative expenses related to corporate operations  including employee compensation  insurance and professional fees  interest income  interest expense  other income loss and equity income loss related to private equity holdings 
other items also include income taxes  which are reviewed by management independent of segment results 
the following tables reflect our consolidated operating data by reportable segment

segment results also include impairment charges and gains or losses related to the disposition of partner companies  except for those reported in discontinued operations 
all significant inter segment activity has been eliminated in consolidation 
accordingly  segment results reported by us exclude the effect of transactions between us and our consolidated partner company 
our operating results  including net income loss before income taxes by segment  were as follows year ended december  in thousands clarient life sciences technology total segments other items corporate operations income tax benefit total other items net loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss there is intense competition in the markets in which our partner companies operate  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
additionally  the markets in which these companies operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent introduction of new products and services  shifting distribution channels  evolving government regulation  frequently changing intellectual property landscapes and changing customer demands 
their future success depends on each company s ability to execute its business plan and to adapt to its respective rapidly changing markets 

table of contents clarient the financial information presented below does not include the results of operations of clarient s technology business  which is included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
clarient sold this business which developed  manufactured and marketed the acis automated image analysis system and related intellectual property to carl zeiss microimaging  inc the acis sale for cash proceeds of million  excluding contingent purchase price of million 
in and  prior to its sale in february  the technology business generated revenue of million and million  and net loss from operations of million and million  respectively 
see note for a discussion of certain current and prior year adjustments of expense classifications between selling  general and administrative expense and cost of sales 
year ended december  in thousands revenue operating expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss other loss interest  net minority interest net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes clarient operates primarily in one business  the delivery of critical oncology testing services to community pathologists  biopharmaceutical companies and other researchers 
as of december   we owned a voting interest in clarient 
year ended december  versus december  revenue 
revenue of million for the year ended december  increased or million from million in the prior year 
the increased revenue resulted from increased volume and favorable mix of oncology diagnostic services provided to clarient s existing clients and the addition of new clients 
clarient s client base increased to approximately active clients at december   from approximately active clients at december  during the first quarter of clarient expanded the breadth of its diagnostic services to include cancer markers for tumors of the colon  prostate  and lung 
clarient expects to steadily increase its menu of oncology diagnostic services to include markers for additional tumor types and to deepen its market penetration for the diagnostic services that it currently provides 
a number of recently published clinical findings have promoted the use of certain biomarkers to predict patient response to a class of colorectal cancer drugs that are focused on blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr signaling pathway 
clarient s ability to perform tests such as k ras a newly emerging biomarker to outline alterations in this major pathway are therefore becoming a more recognized tool in the medical community for predicting an individual s response to drug therapies for colorectal cancers 
clarient has also steadily increased the depth of its diagnostic services for certain cancer types that clarient has previously provided  including lymphoma leukemia 
clarient s expanding capabilities in ihc  flow cytometry  fish and molecular pcr  and its marketing of such capabilities  has enabled its revenue growth in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
clarient anticipates that its revenue will continue to increase as clarient further executes its operational strategy of expanding the breadth and depth of its oncology diagnostic services  and the means by which its services are marketed and delivered to its customers 

table of contents another contributor to its revenue growth has been an overall increase in medicare reimbursement rates which include cancer diagnostic services  effective january  in addition  many of clarient s third party contract rates are based upon medicare rates  which consequently  also increased 
in july  the medicare rate increase for technical cpt codes under the physician fee schedule that retroactively took effect as of january  was extended eighteen months through december  effective january   numerous other cpt codes under the physician fee schedule and clinical fee schedule for services clarient performs generally increased through december  cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of 
the million increase was driven by an overall increase in revenue  and was primarily related to additional laboratory personnel costs of million  increased laboratory reagents and other supplies expense of million  increased allocated facilities expense of million  increased cost of tests performed on its behalf by other laboratories of million and an increase in shipping expense of million 
gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by an overall increase in revenue  including higher value oncology diagnostic services 
in addition  employee productivity continues to improve based on clarient s metrics of specimens prepared and tested by month per full time equivalent employee 
clarient has also realized greater economies of scale in operations through its business growth as compared to the prior year 
clarient anticipates that gross margins will improve as its testing volume increases  clarient more effectively utilizes its operating capacity  and more efficiently manages its operations 
if the adjusted medicare reimbursement rates effective january  are decreased after december   gross margins could be adversely affected 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  increased  or million  from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily related to a million increase in bad debt expense  additional administrative personnel costs of million to support its business growth and new in house billing and collection department  additional sales and marketing personnel costs of million  a million increase in travel related expenses and a million increase in tradeshow and advertising expenses  partially offset by a million decrease in third party billing and collection fees 
accounting and legal fees increased by million and million  respectively 
the increase in accounting fees was primarily associated with the testing of internal controls over financial reporting 
the increase in legal fees was primarily associated with sec compliance  corporate governance  financing arrangements and executive compensation the increase in bad debt expense is primarily related to clarient s increase in revenue as compared to the prior year and the impact on cash collections of delays in clarient s internal billing and collection efforts 
bad debt expense was also impacted by higher loss experience  including significant uncollectible accounts identified during the second half of which were previously serviced by clarient s former third party billing and collection service provider 
clarient expects that bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue in will be less as compared to as clarient further staffs its in house billing and collection department  more effectively manages its billing and collection function and improves the quality of its billing and collection processes 
interest  net 
interest expense in was million  compared to million in the decrease was due to lower outstanding borrowings under clarient s third party financing facilities 
net income loss 
net income in was million compared to a net loss of million in the improvement was primarily attributable to higher margins from increased revenue

liquidity and capital resources parent company we fund our operations with cash on hand as well as proceeds from sales of and distributions from partner companies  private equity funds and marketable securities 
in prior periods  we have also used sales of our equity and issuance of debt as sources of liquidity and may do so in the future

table of contents at december   we maintained a revolving credit facility that provided for borrowings and issuances of letters of credit and guarantees up to million 
borrowing availability under the facility was reduced by the amounts outstanding for our borrowings and letters of credit and amounts guaranteed under clarient s facility maintained with that same lender 
this credit facility bore interest at the prime rate at december  for outstanding borrowings 
the credit facility was subject to an unused commitment fee of per annum  subject to reduction based on deposits maintained at the bank 
the credit facility required us to maintain an unrestricted cash collateral account at that same bank  equal to our borrowings and letters of credit and amounts borrowed by clarient under the guaranteed portion of its facility maintained with that same bank 
at december   the required cash collateral pursuant to the credit facility agreement was million  which amount is included within cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  availability under our revolving credit facility at december  was as follows total in thousands size of credit facility guarantees of clarient s facility at same bank a outstanding letter of credit b amount available at december  a our ability to borrow under the credit facility was limited by the amounts outstanding for our borrowings and letters of credit and amounts guaranteed under partner company facilities maintained at the same bank 
of the total facilities  million was outstanding under this facility at december  and was included as debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
b in connection with the sale of compucom  we provided to the landlord of compucom s dallas headquarters  a million letter of credit  which will expire on march  on february  we entered into a new loan agreement with a different commercial bank which provides us with a revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate amount of million 
actual availability under the credit facility will be based on the amount of cash we maintain at the bank as well as certain percentages of the value of our public and private partner company interests 
this credit facility bears interest at the prime rate for outstanding borrowings  subject to an increase in certain circumstances 
other than for limited exceptions  we are required to maintain all of our depository and operating accounts and not less than of our investment and securities accounts at the bank 
the credit facility matures on december  in conjunction with the execution of our new loan agreement  we are terminating our prior revolving credit facility 
notwithstanding such termination  we will continue to guaranty the obligations of clarient under its continuing credit facility with the bank  which matures on march   and will maintain a cash account at the bank in the minimum amount of million to support such guaranty 
we have committed capital of approximately million  including conditional commitments to provide non consolidated partner companies with additional funding and commitments made to various private equity funds in prior years 
these commitments will be funded over the next several years  including approximately million which is expected to be funded in the next months 
the transactions we enter into in pursuit of our strategy could increase or decrease our liquidity at any point in time 
as we seek to acquire interests in technology and life sciences companies  provide additional funding to existing partner companies  or commit capital to other initiatives  we may be required to expend our cash or incur debt  which will decrease our liquidity 
conversely  as we dispose of our interests in partner companies from time to time  we may receive proceeds from such sales  which could increase our liquidity 
from time to time  we are engaged in discussions concerning acquisitions and dispositions which  if consummated  could impact our liquidity  perhaps significantly 
in may  we entered into a million loan agreement with warren v 
musser  our former chairman and chief executive officer

table of contents we have received distributions as both a general partner and a limited partner from certain private equity funds 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to return a portion or all the distributions we received as a general partner of a fund for further distribution to such fund s limited partners the clawback 
the maximum clawback we could be required to return for our general partner interest is million  of which million was reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and million was reflected in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  we paid million of our estimated clawback liabilities in our previous ownership in the general partners of the funds that have potential clawback liabilities ranges from 
the clawback liability is joint and several  such that we may be required to fund the clawback for other general partners should they default 
the funds have taken several steps to reduce the potential liabilities should other general partners default  including withholding all general partner distributions and placing them in escrow and adding rights of set off among certain funds 
we believe our potential liability due to the possibility of default by other general partners is remote 
for the reasons we presented above  we believe our cash and cash equivalents at december   availability under our revolving credit facility and other internal sources of cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next months  including commitments to our existing companies and funds  possible additional funding of existing partner companies and our general corporate requirements 
our acquisition of new partner company interests is always contingent upon our availability of cash to fund such deployments  and our timing of monetization events directly affects our availability of cash 
consolidated partner company clarient  our consolidated partner company  incurred operating losses in and may need additional capital to fund its operations 
from time to time  clarient may require additional debt or equity financing or credit support from us to fund planned expansion activities 
if we decide not to  or cannot provide sufficient capital resources to allow them to reach a positive cash flow position  and they are unable to raise capital from outside resources  they may need to scale back their operations 
as described below  we have renewed  expanded and extended a revolving line of credit to clarient 
clarient maintains a million revolving credit agreement with a bank which was amended and restated on february  this facility contains financial and non financial covenants and matures march  on july   clarient entered into a separate million secured credit agreement with a finance company which was amended and restated on february  the secured credit agreement expires on january  actual availability under the facility is limited by clarient s qualified accounts receivable and certain liquidity factors 
clarient reduced indebtedness to us under the mezzanine facility defined below with a portion of the proceeds borrowed under the revolving credit facility 
in march  we provided a subordinated revolving credit line the mezzanine facility to clarient 
under the mezzanine facility  we committed to provide clarient access to up to million in working capital funding  which was reduced to million as a result of the acis sale 
the mezzanine facility originally had a term expiring on december  on march   the mezzanine facility was extended through april   and increased from million to million 
in connection with the extension and increase of the mezzanine facility  the company received from clarient five year warrants to purchase shares of clarient common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the company received million of these warrants at the time of the extension of the mezzanine facility and the company received an additional million warrants through september   based on the amount of borrowings remaining outstanding under the mezzanine facility at certain interim dates 
the mezzanine facility was subject to reduction to million under certain circumstances involving the completion of replacement financing by clarient 
at december   million was outstanding under the mezzanine facility 
on february  clarient further refinanced  renewed and expanded the mezzanine facility 
in connection with such renewal  clarient issued us fully vested five year warrants to purchase  shares of clarient common stock at an exercise price of clarient s day trailing close price of its common stock as of february

table of contents in september  clarient entered into a million senior secured revolving credit agreement with a third party lender 
borrowing availability under the agreement was based on the amount of clarient s qualified accounts receivable  less certain reserves 
the agreement bore interest at variable rates based on the lower of day libor plus or the prime rate plus 
on march   clarient borrowed million under the mezzanine facility to repay and terminate this facility  and borrowed million under the mezzanine facility to repay and terminate its equipment line of credit with the same lender 
as reported in its form k for the year ended december   clarient s independent auditors have determined that there is substantial doubt about clarient s ability to continue as a going concern 
clarient s credit facilities with its lenders contain certain covenants which require compliance 
in order for clarient to comply with its financial covenants contained within its credit facilities with its third party lenders  as amended in february see note  its results of operations and level of cash collections in and beyond must exceed its results  and such outcome is uncertain 
failure to maintain compliance with the financial and or certain other covenants contained within clarient s credit facilities would constitute an event of default under the respective credit facility and by agreement  would result in a cross default for the other credit facilities 
if clarient were not able to obtain a waiver of default from its lenders  clarient s borrowings under the respective credit facilities would immediately become due and payable 
there can be no assurance that clarient would be able to obtain waivers from existing third party lenders or fully access its existing financing sources in the event of default 
at december   clarient did not have sufficient cash availability to repay its credit facilities which will be due in the first quarter of in addition  clarient has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations 
clarient is currently in the process of evaluating certain financing alternatives in light of the stated maturity dates of its current credit arrangements 
due to clarient s financial condition and the ongoing turmoil in the financial and credit markets  clarient s ability to obtain extensions to its existing third party credit facilities  or to obtain new credit facilities  may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that clarient will be able to obtain financing on terms that are favorable to clarient  or obtain additional or extended financing at all 
as a result  there is a substantial doubt about clarient s ability to continue as a going concern
