we target the wireless market with our uwb devices and z wave devices 
we believe we are the leading provider of digital media processor socs for set top boxes in the iptv market in terms of units shipped 
for set top boxes in the iptv market  we believe we are currently the only provider qualified to ship digital media processor socs based on the microsoft iptv platform 
our soc solutions are used by leading iptv set top box providers  such as cisco systems scientific atlanta  motorola  netgem and utstarcom 
iptv set top boxes incorporating our soc solutions are deployed by telecommunications carriers globally  including carriers in asia  europe and north america  such as at t  british telecom  deutsche telekom and freebox 
we work closely with these carriers and set top box providers  as well as with systems software providers  such as microsoft  to design solutions that address the carriers specific requirements regarding features and performance 
our media processor products are also used by consumer electronics providers  such as d link  linksys  netgear  panasonic  pioneer  sharp and sony  in applications such as blu ray dvd players  hdtvs and connected media player 
our vxp products are one of the leading solutions for studio quality video image processing and are used by leading industry participants such as polycom  sony and panasonic 
our uwb and z wave devices product lines target emerging markets and  while they are in production now  we have not yet experienced significant orders from our customers 
our primary target markets are iptv  connected media player  prosumer and industrial audio video  hdtv and wireless 
the iptv set top box market consists of consumer and commercial products that distribute and receive streaming video using internet protocol  or ip 
the connected media player market consists primarily of blu ray dvd players  digital media adapters and portable media devices that perform playback of digital media stored on optical or hard disk formats 
the prosumer and industrial audio video market consists of studio quality audio video receivers and monitors  digital projectors and medical video monitors 
the hdtv market consists of digital television sets offering high definition capability  including flat panel and projection devices 
the uwb wireless market consists of wireless hdav and speaker solutions and wireless home entertainment networking solutions over coax 
the z wave wireless market consists of a wide variety of home control products such as thermostats  light switches and door locks 
we also sell products into other markets such as the pc based add in and connectivity devices markets 
we currently derive minor revenues from sales of our products into these other markets 
for fiscal and  we derived and  respectively  of our net revenue from our soc solutions 
our soc solutions consist of highly integrated semiconductors and software that process digital video and audio content 
our net revenue from sales of our soc solutions decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in our socs sales in fiscal was in part attributable to the overall slowdown in the iptv market as a result of macroeconomic conditions 
we do not enter into long term commitment contracts with our customers and receive substantially all of our net revenue based on purchase orders 
we forecast demand for our products based not only on our assessment of the requirements of our direct customers  but also on the anticipated requirements of the telecommunications carriers that our customers serve 
we work with both our direct customers and these carriers to address the market demands and the necessary specifications for our technologies 
however  our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our relationship with these customers or lead to excess inventory  which could negatively impact our gross margins in a particular period 
many of our target markets are characterized by intense price competition 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and  as a result  we expect our average selling prices to decline over time 
however  on occasion  we have reduced our prices for individual customer volume orders as part of our strategy to obtain a competitive position in our target markets 
the willingness of customers to design our socs into their products depends to a significant extent upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset any declines in product selling prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross margins 
we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in our average selling prices  volume order discounts  mix of product sales  our costs  the extent of development fees and provisions for inventory obsolescence 

table of contents share repurchase program on february   we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
on march   we announced that our board of directors had approved an increase of million additional shares to the program  resulting in a total amount authorized to be repurchased under the share repurchase program of million shares 
the share repurchase program had a one year term  and thus  terminated on march  we purchased a cumulative total of approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to the repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of million at an average price of per share 
the most recent repurchase was transacted on july  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from three principal sources product sales  product development contracts and service contracts 
we generally recognize revenue for product sales and service contracts in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  under which revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to oems  distributors and end users are generally recognized upon shipment  as shipping terms are predominantly fob shipping point  except that revenue is deferred when we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectability is not assured 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when collection subsequently becomes probable and returns are estimable 
allowances for sales returns  discounts and warranty costs are recorded at the time that the associated revenue is recognized 
product development agreements typically require that we provide customized software to support customer specific designs  accordingly  this revenue is accounted for under the aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
we offer post contract customer support pcs on a contractual basis for additional fees  typically with a one year term 
in instances where software is bundled with the pcs  vendor specific objective evidence does not exist to allocate the total fee to all undelivered elements of the arrangement and  therefore  revenue and related costs are deferred until all elements  except pcs  are delivered 
the total fee is then recognized ratably over the pcs term typically one year after the software is delivered 
development costs related to product development agreements are classified as cost of revenue 
revenue from service contracts consist of fees for providing engineering support services and are recognized ratably over the contract term as services are provided 
expenses related to support service revenue are included in cost of revenue 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes  and any operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
income taxes are accounted for under an asset and liability approach in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax credits and net operating losses available for carry forwards and significant temporary differences 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non current based upon the classification of the related asset or liability in the financial statements or the expected timing of their reversal if they do not relate to a specific asset or liability 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax asset if it is considered more likely than not that some portion of  or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable to the entity as enacted by the relevant tax authorities 

table of contents in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted the provisions of fin on february   the beginning of its fiscal valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates an actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product 
a provision is recorded for inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
in addition  we will write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
increases to the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenue 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower costed inventory is subsequently sold  the related allowance is matched to the movement of related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
purchased intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets sfas 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and forecasted operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
share based compensation upon adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  as of january   we reassessed our equity compensation valuation method and related assumptions 
our determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant utilizes an option pricing model  and is impacted by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting date and stock option exercise date 
option pricing models have been developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value  in our opinion  the existing black scholes option pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  and included a combination of payment awards granted prior to january  and payment awards granted subsequent to january  for share based payment awards granted prior to january   we attribute the value of share based compensation  determined under sfas r  to expense using the accelerated multiple option approach 
share based compensation expense included in fiscal  and includes the impact of estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
the adoption of sfas r requires us to reflect the net cumulative impact of estimating forfeitures in the determination of period expense by reversing the previously recognized cumulative compensation expense related to those forfeitures  rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted 
we did not record this cumulative impact upon adoption  as the amount was insignificant 
stock options granted in periods prior to january  were measured based on sfas requirements  whereas stock options granted subsequent to january  were measured based on sfas r requirements 

table of contents valuation of marketable securities our marketable securities include auction rate securities  or ars  corporate commercial paper and bonds and us agency notes 
we classify our marketable securities as available for sale and report them at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we monitor all our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have a decline in fair value  use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration of any impairment  iii the financial condition and future prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
at january   we held nine auction rate securities with a cost and par value of million 
auction rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
historically  the fair value of our ars has been determined by the frequent auction periods  generally every days  which provided liquidity at par value for these investments 
however  subsequent to february  all auctions involving such securities held by us have failed 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  however  liquidity of the securities will continue to be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets for these ars develop 
we cannot be certain regarding the amount of time it will take for an auction market or other markets to develop for these securities 
in october  our cash investment advisor  ubs  acknowledged our acceptance of its proposal of a comprehensive settlement agreement  in which all the ars currently in our portfolio could be redeemed at par value 
the offer to redeem will be at our option during a two year period beginning in june the offer also gives ubs the discretion to buy any or all of these securities from us at par value at any time 
additionally  the proposed solution by ubs to the lack of liquidity of our ars included a commitment effective october through june to loan an amount up to of the par value of the ars 
the interest charged on such loan would be equal to the proportional amount of interest being paid by the issuers of the ars borrowed against 
at january   ubs provided an estimated value for the nine ars of approximately million  which reflects an unrealized loss of million from our original purchase price 
our management has not adopted ubs estimated value of our ars for the reasons described below 
we have reviewed the prospectuses for each of the nine ars in our investment portfolio as of january  and determined that the unprecedented disruption in the auction process and resulting pattern of interest payments was in accordance with their established rules of operation under these circumstances 
the default mechanism called for in the operating rules of these instruments is designed to adjust their interest payments to a limit based on the income generated by their underlying student loans 
the most significant consequences of this mechanism are the preservation of their aaa credit rating while adjusting to a continuing stream of interest payments to the security holders at a rate correlating to contemporary credit market rates 
as a result of this review  we reached the conclusion that the securities do have a strong underlying principle value and that any potential adjustment in their carrying value would be based upon our ability to endure their lack of liquidity  the degree of certainty of continuing interest payments and the rate of return on these securities 
given that we expect considerable liquidity from our other assets  foresee continuing positive cash flow and have accepted our investment advisor s offer to purchase all of our ars at par value in june  we do not consider the remaining possible liquidity risk and ubs default risk to be significant enough to justify a reduction in the carrying value 
the remaining valuation factor that we considered was the rate of return evidenced by the interest received 
we used a discounted cash flow calculation that reached a valuation that was similar to other of our recent investments with comparably high credit ratings 
as a result of this judgment process and in accordance with the various accounting pronouncements in this area  we reached the conclusion that the carrying value of our ars has not been impaired and that we have no expectation of any material adverse impact on our future results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources associated with holding these securities 
at january   all of our ars are classified as long term marketable securities and as level assets in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  as their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities 
if different assumptions were used for the various inputs to the valuation approach including  but not limited to  assumptions involving the estimated lives of the ars  the estimated cash flows over those estimated lives  and the estimated discount rates  applied to those cash flows  the estimated fair value of these investments could be significantly lower than the fair value we determined as of january 
table of contents litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
if any of these events were to happen  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional expenses 
accounts receivable we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot estimate whether collectability is reasonably assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we also provide allowances for bad debt and sales returns 
in establishing our allowance for bad debt we review the customer s payment history and information regarding their credit worthiness 
in establishing our allowance for sales returns  we make estimates of potential future returns of products for which revenue has been recognized in the current period  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
in fiscal  and  we recorded provisions for sales returns  discounts and bad debt in the total amounts of million  million and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or future product returns increased  additional allowances may be required

the decline in average selling prices was primarily the result of certain customers achieving cumulative volume sales targets during the year on purchases of our mature smp series soc products 
this decline in average selling prices was not offset by the increase in soc units shipped during fiscal compared to fiscal due to a reduction in inventory levels in our customers supply chains 
our net revenue for fiscal increased approximately million  or  compared to fiscal this increase in revenue for fiscal was primarily attributable to increased sales of our socs into the iptv and connected media player markets 
net revenue by target market we sell our products into five primary markets  which are the iptv market  the connected media player market  the prosumer and industrial audio video market  the hdtv market and the wireless market 
we also sell our products  to a lesser extent  into several other markets  such as the pc based add in market  which we refer to collectively as our other market

our revenue from the iptv market as a percentage of our total revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased by  primarily due to the decrease in socs shipped to our customers in the connected media player market 
for fiscal  revenue from sales of our soc solutions into the iptv market increased million  or from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increased volume of socs shipped to our customers in the iptv market incorporating our socs into their products  primarily our smp soc series 
our revenue from the iptv market as a percentage of our total revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased by primarily due to expansion of the iptv market and increased sales to existing customers as well as sales to new customers 
we expect our revenue from the iptv market to fluctuate in future periods as this revenue is based on iptv service deployments by telecommunication service providers and the changes in inventory levels at the contract manufacturers that supply them 
connected media player for fiscal  revenue from sales of our products to the connected media player market decreased million  or  from fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales to customers who incorporate our socs into blu ray players as a result of increased competition 
for the same reason  our percentage of net revenue from sales into the connected media player market decreased as a percentage of our total revenue 
for fiscal  revenue from sales of our products to the connected media player market increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of our customers products incorporating our socs  including an increase in blu ray and digital media adapter applications 
however  for this period our percentage of net revenue from sales into the connected media player market decreased as a percentage of our total revenue  primarily due to a disproportionate increase in the sales of our products into the iptv market 
prosumer and industrial audio video for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the prosumer and industrial audio video market was million 
we entered into this market through our acquisition of the vxp group in february hdtv for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the hdtv market decreased by million  or  and also decreased by as a percentage of total net revenue from fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of our socs to customers who incorporate our product as a result of increased competition 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the hdtv market increased by million  or  from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an overall increase in demand for our hdtv applications 
wireless for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the wireless market increased by million  or  from fiscal this increase was the result of our entry into the wireless home automation market through our acquisition of zensys holdings corporation in december we expect net revenue from this market to increase in future periods as we expand sales of the z wave product line 
other our other markets consist of pc add ins  development contracts  services and other ancillary markets 
for fiscal  net revenue decreased million  or  from fiscal the decrease is primarily due to lower engineering development for customization of our socs

the decline in average selling prices was primarily the result of certain customers achieving cumulative volume sales targets during the year on purchases of our mature soc products 
this decline in average selling prices was not offset by the increase in soc units shipped during fiscal compared to fiscal due to a reduction in inventory levels in our customers supply chains 
the increase of million  or  in net revenue from socs in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in sales of our soc solutions into newer generation iptv products and blu ray players 
other we derive net revenue from other products and services  including engineering support services for both hardware and software  engineering development for customization of socs and other accessories 
the decrease of million  or  in our net revenue from other products in fiscal from fiscal was due to a reduction in engineering development and service fees and development kits 
the slight increase in our net revenue from other products in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to increases in sales of our engineering development kits related to our socs and increases in support services as a result of our increased soc sales  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our board products as a result of decreased demand 
we anticipate our net revenue from board products will be relatively flat or decrease in future periods due to our strategic decision to focus on our soc solutions

asia our net revenue in absolute dollars from asia decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in net revenue from asia in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to the decline in revenues from customers in japan and korea due to unit volume decline in blu ray dvd players and in singapore due to a reduction in inventory levels in our customers in the supply chain related to iptv during fiscal our net revenue in absolute dollars from asia increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue from asia in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to our customers continued expansion of their products incorporating our socs 
also  companies who incorporate our products into their finished goods and are located in other regions continued to move their production orders to large designers and manufacturers located in the asia region which has led to a further shifting of our net revenue from other regions into the asia region as many of our direct customers are large designers and manufacturers located in asia 
we also continued to experience large volume orders from two distributors located in asia

gross profit and gross margin the following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin in thousands years ended january  february  february  change change gross profit gross margin the decrease in gross profit in fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in revenues as well as a decline in our average selling prices per soc unit which was only partially offset by a decline in our average costs per soc unit 
the significant increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of our socs used in the iptv and connected media player markets 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of net revenue were million in fiscal  million in and million in fiscal the percentage point decrease in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decline in our average selling prices per soc  which was only partially offset by a decline in our average costs per soc 
our average cost per unit did not decline as fast as our average selling prices due to a buildup of die bank in the second quarter of fiscal that was not consumed as demand decreased due to a reduction in inventory levels in our customer s supply chain 
additionally  we experienced an aggregate increase of million in amortization of acquired intangibles due to the vxp and zensys acquisitions that were completed in fiscal  a million increase in write downs for excess and slow moving inventory and a million increase in goldwire costs for material used in our smp series soc assembly process

amortization expense of million and million for other purchased intangible assets for fiscal and  respectively  is classified as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
amortization expense of million for other purchased intangible assets for fiscal is classified as sales and marketing expense and no amortization expense for fiscal at january   the unamortized balance from purchased intangible assets was million which will be amortized to future periods based on their respective remaining estimated useful lives 
if we purchase additional intangible assets in the future  our cost of revenue or other operating expenses will increase by the amortization of those assets 
gains on sale of long term investment during fiscal  we sold our investment in envivio  inc  a privately held company  for approximately million including a gain of approximately  we recognized no gain on sales of long term investments in fiscal or we do not expect to sell any of our remaining long term investments in the near future

liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth the cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities in thousands 
table of contents january  february  cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities as of january   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million  which represents a decrease of million from million at february  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities was primarily the result of million used for share repurchases  million used for the acquisitions of vxp group in february and zensys holdings corporation in december  purchases of million for software  equipment and leasehold improvements  million in purchases of long term marketable securities and long term investments of million 
these uses of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities were partially offset by million of cash generated from our operating activities and million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock through our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
our primary net cash inflows and outflows at the end of each fiscal year were as follows in thousands years ended january  february  february  net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal the cash provided by our operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to net income of million  non cash operating expenses of million  a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million increase in other long term liabilities and a million decrease in other assets 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a million increase in inventories and a million increase in prepaid expense 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due primarily to lower inventory purchases and the timing of payments for tax liabilities and software licenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower product revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in inventories resulted from an increase in our die bank level at the end of the fiscal compared to the end of fiscal at the end of fiscal  our die bank level was low relative to the sales volume we were experiencing at that time due to rapidly increasing demand during fiscal at the end of fiscal our die bank was somewhat elevated relative to our sales volume due to a strategic build up of certain wafers for some of our key customers 
the increase in other long term liabilities is primarily due to higher deferred tax obligations which resulted in increased long term income taxes payable and deferred tax liabilities non cash charges included share based compensation of million  depreciation and amortization of million  provision for sales returns  discounts and doubtful accounts of million  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and acquired in process research and development of million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal the cash provided by our operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to net income of million  non cash expenses of million and a million increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
these amounts were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventories and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the increases in accounts receivables and inventories in were the result of the increase in our sales in the iptv  high definition dvd and other media players  and hdtv markets 
non cash charges included share based compensation of million in fiscal offset by a reduction of deferred income taxes of million 

table of contents cash flows from our operating activities will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow net revenues while managing the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us  the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in our investing activities was million for fiscal  which was primarily due to net cash paid of million in connection with the acquisitions of vxp group and zensys holdings corporation  purchases of software  equipment and leasehold improvements of million and purchases of private equity investments for million  partially offset by net sales and maturities of marketable securities and long term investment of million

net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  which primarily consisted of million of net proceeds from our follow on offering  million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and million excess tax benefit from share based compensation 
prior to fiscal  our primary sources of funds were proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
in certain periods  cash generated from operations has been a source of funds 
while we generated cash from operations for fiscal  and  it is possible that our operations will consume cash in future periods 
based on our currently anticipated cash needs  we believe that our current reserve of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements  obligations  capital expenditures  strategic investments and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities during or beyond the next months  and our future capital requirements may vary significantly from those currently planned 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable security balances will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow revenue  the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us and the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
at january   we held nine auction rate securities  or ars  with a cost and par value of million  which are all classified as long term marketable securities 
our marketable securities consist primarily of auction rate securities  corporate commercial paper and bonds and us agency notes 
we monitor all our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have had a decline in fair value  we use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration of any impairment  iii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we would recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
auction rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
historically  the fair value of our ars has been determined by the frequent auction periods  generally every days  which provided liquidity at par value for these investments 
however  subsequent to february  all auctions involving such securities held by us have failed 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars will continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  however  liquidity of the securities will continue to be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets for these ars develop 
we cannot be certain regarding the amount of time it will take for an auction market or other markets to develop for these securities 
in october  our cash investment advisor  ubs  acknowledged our acceptance of its proposal of a comprehensive settlement agreement  in which all the ars currently in our portfolio could be redeemed at par value 
the offer to redeem will be at our option during a two year period beginning in june the offer also gives ubs the discretion to buy any or all of these securities from us at par value at any time 
additionally  the proposed solution by ubs to the lack of liquidity of our ars included a commitment effective october through june to loan an amount up to of the par value of the ars 
the interest charged on such loan would be equal to the proportional amount of interest being paid by the issuers of the ars borrowed against 
at january   ubs provided an estimated value for the nine ars of approximately million  which reflects an unrealized loss of million from our original cost 
our management has not adopted ubs estimated value of our ars for the reasons described below 

table of contents we have reviewed the prospectuses for each of the nine ars in our investment portfolio as of january  and determined that the unprecedented disruption in the auction process and resulting pattern of interest payments was in accordance with their established rules of operation under these circumstances 
the default mechanism called for in the operating rules of these instruments is designed to adjust their interest payments to a limit based on the income generated by their underlying student loans 
the most significant consequences of this mechanism are the preservation of their aaa credit rating while adjusting to a continuing stream of interest payments to the security holders at a rate correlating to contemporary credit market rates 
as a result of this review  we reached the conclusion that the securities do have a strong underlying principle value and that any potential adjustment in their carrying value would be based upon our ability to endure their lack of liquidity  the degree of certainty of continuing interest payments and the rate of return on these securities 
given that we expect considerable liquidity from our other assets  foresee continuing positive cash flow and have accepted our investment advisor s offer to purchase all of our ars at par value in june  we do not consider the remaining possible liquidity risk and ubs default risk to be significant enough to justify a reduction in their carrying value 
the remaining valuation factor that we considered was the rate of return evidenced by the interest received 
we used a discounted cash flow calculation that reached a valuation that was similar to other of our recent investments with comparably high credit ratings 
as a result of this judgment process and in accordance with the various accounting pronouncements in this area  we reached the conclusion that the carrying value of our ars has not been impaired and that we have no expectation of any material adverse impact on our future results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources associated with holding these securities 
contractual obligations and commitments we do not have guaranteed price or quantity commitments from any of our suppliers 
we generally maintain products for distribution through corporate markets based on forecasts rather than firm purchase orders 
additionally  we generally acquire products for sale to our oem customers based on purchase orders received as well as forecasts from such customers 
purchase orders with delivery dates greater than weeks are typically cancelable without penalty from such oem customers 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase semiconductor wafers and other materials from our suppliers on an eight to twelve week lead time basis 
the following table sets forth the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations year or less years years thereafter total operating leases non cancelable purchase orders in march  we entered into a new lease agreement for a facility of approximately  square feet in paris  france 
the facility is used for our french research and development operations and the lease will expire in march additionally  in june  we entered into a new lease agreement for a facility of approximately  square feet in ontario  canada 
the facility is used for our canadian research and development operations and the lease will expire in june the base rent for the facilities in france and canada will remain flat over the life of the leases  with free rent for the initial two and three months  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the standard s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of our choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which we have chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas and sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and we did not elect to adopt the fair value option under sfas

revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination  requires related acquisition costs to be expensed in the period incurred and determines what information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engaged in were recorded and disclosed according to sfas until january  we expect sfas no 
r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of any acquisitions it consummates after the effective date of january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no

 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas this pronouncement requires enhanced disclosures concerning a company s treatment of costs incurred to renew or extend the term of a recognized intangible asset 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of fsp  but do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our operations and financial condition 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity at january  we held money market funds of million  short term marketable securities of million and long term marketable securities of million 
if short term interest rates were to decrease  the decreased interest income associated with these money market funds and marketable securities would not have a significant impact on our net income and cash flows

foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity the canadian dollar  danish kroner and euro are the primary financial currencies of our subsidiaries in canada  denmark and france  respectively 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and inter company balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain certain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar  canadian dollar  euro  danish kroner and singapore dollar 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rate at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an insignificant amount
