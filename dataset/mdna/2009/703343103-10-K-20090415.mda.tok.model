item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we provide an overview of the impact that the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions had on our operations and in the rv  mh  and residential housing industries in in the first quarter of  we completed the divestiture of one of our non core operations  american hardwoods  inc american hardwoods  and in made the decision to divest our aluminum extrusion operation 
see strategic divestitures below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further details 
patrick had three reportable business segments in based on continuing operations primary manufactured products  distribution  and other component manufactured products 
financial information about patrick s three segments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition the mh and rv industries are highly competitive with low barriers to entry 
this level of competition carries through to the suppliers to these industries 
across the company s range of products and services  competition is based primarily on price  product features  quality  and service 
we have several competitors in each class of our products 
all of our competitors currently compete with us on a regional and local basis 
in order for a competitor to compete with us on a national basis  we believe that a substantial capital commitment and investment and experienced personnel would be required 
the other industrial markets in which we continue to expand are also highly competitive 
in  the declining sales volume and depressed economic conditions in all three of the primary markets we serve caused extreme pricing pressure on certain products as supply outweighed demand 
as the rv and mh industries are projecting lower volume in compared to prior year levels  the company expects competition in most of the products lines and industries we serve to remain intense in and potentially into given this environment  the company has identified several operating strategies to maintain or enhance earnings through productivity and fixed cost reduction initiatives  expansion into new product lines  and optimization of capacity utilization 
strategy overview we believe that we have developed quality working relationships with our customers and suppliers  and have oriented our business to the needs of these customers 
these customers include all of the larger mh and rv manufacturers and a number of large to medium sized industrial customers 
our industrial customers generally are directly linked to the residential housing markets 
our mh and rv customers generally demand the lowest competitive prices  high quality standards  short lead times  and a high degree of flexibility from their suppliers 
our industrial customers generally are less price sensitive than our mh and rv customers  and more focused on quality customer service and quick response time 
consequently  we have focused our efforts on maintaining and improving the quality of our manufactured products  developing a nationwide manufacturing and distribution presence in response to our customers needs for flexibility and short lead times  and prioritizing the implementation of lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement in all of our facilities including our corporate office 
additionally  because of the short lead times  which range from hours to same day order receipt and delivery  we have intensified our focus on reducing our inventory levels with the help of some of our key suppliers with vendor managed inventory programs 
these initiatives have been instrumental in improving our operating cash flow and liquidity 
as we explore new markets and industries  we believe that these and other strategic initiatives provide us with a strong foundation for future growth 
in  approximately of our sales were to the mh industry  to the rv industry  and to the industrial and other markets 
in  approximately of our sales were to the mh industry  to the rv industry  and to the industrial and other markets 
operating strategies key operating strategies identified by management  include the following strategic acquisitions  expansion and restructuring we supply a broad variety of building material products and  with our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities  we believe that we are well positioned for the introduction of new products 
we  from time to time  consider the acquisition of additional product lines  facilities  companies with a strategic fit  or other assets to complement or expand our existing businesses 
in may  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of adorn holdings  inc adorn  an elkhart  indiana based major manufacturer and supplier to the mh  rv  and industrial markets  for million 
this acquisition represented the largest acquisition in our history  virtually doubled our manufacturing revenues  and immediately strengthened our market position and presence in the major industries that we serve 
due to the size and complexity of the acquisition  and the potential for synergy realization through facility rationalization  headcount reduction  vendor consolidation  and the implementation of best practices  we intensely focused our efforts for the remainder of and through the first nine months of on the consolidation of adorn into patrick in order to maximize the planned efficiencies as soon as possible 
in may  we initiated a restructuring plan the restructuring plan to integrate adorn with our existing businesses 
the completion of the restructuring plan in the third quarter of resulted in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately million 
expenses associated with the restructuring plan included the closure of duplicate facilities  severance related to the elimination of redundant jobs  and various asset write downs related to the consolidation of product lines 
we have realized  and expect to continue to realize  synergy savings from this acquisition on a go forward basis 
while operating under the current depressed market and economic conditions  which we believe will continue through the end of and possibly into  we expect to focus on fixed cost and debt reduction initiatives in order to reduce our leverage ratio  maintain operating cash flow  meet the covenants under our credit agreement and maximize efficiencies from the consolidation of adorn into patrick 
strategic divestitures in an effort to strategically align our current operations with businesses within our core competencies and reduce overall fixed costs  we have explored and will continue to explore various alternatives for the divestiture of certain unprofitable  non core operations 
in  we identified our american hardwoods and aluminum extrusion operations as non core operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we reclassified the carrying values of the assets of american hardwoods and the aluminum extrusion operation to assets held for sale  which is included in current assets on the consolidated statements of financial position 
the financial results of these operations have also been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and all prior period operating results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
sale of american hardwoods  inc operation in january  the company sold certain assets and the business of the american hardwoods operation  an industrial hardwood product distributor located in phoenix  arizona  and entered into a separate real estate purchase agreement with the buyer to sell the building that housed this operation  subject to certain conditions 
at the time of the american hardwoods purchase two years ago  we were focused on adding products that complemented patrick s existing product lines while further diversifying our customer base and driving market penetration in growing economic regions 
since early  the downturn in general economic conditions adversely affected the demand for building products in the phoenix market and  ultimately  the sales volume from this operation 
the decision to divest american hardwoods and to seek to divest the aluminum extrusion operation discussed below was largely based on projected and potential operating losses under the current operating model and working capital requirements of these operations that forced us to assess the overall fit of these operations within the parameters of our strategic plan 
previously  the financial results of american hardwoods had been included in the distribution segment 
sale of aluminum extrusion operation in the fourth quarter of  the company made the decision to divest certain assets of its aluminum extrusion operation located in mishawaka  indiana 
previously  the financial results of this operation comprised the entire engineered solutions business segment 
estimated pretax charges of approximately million associated with the planned divesture are reflected in discontinued operations and consist of the write down to fair market value of trade receivables  inventories and fixed assets 
these assets have been classified as held for sale 
diversification into other markets while we continually seek to improve our position as a leading supplier to the mh and rv industries and have substantially increased our presence in these markets through the acquisition of adorn in  we are also seeking to expand our product lines into other industrial  commercial and institutional markets 
many of our products  such as countertops  cabinet doors  laminated panels  and shelving  have applications in the kitchen cabinet  office furniture and fixture  and architectural markets 
we have a dedicated sales force focused on increasing our industrial market penetration and on our diversification into more commercial and institutional markets 
because order size from the industrial and commercial markets tends to be for larger numbers of units  we enjoy better production efficiencies for these orders 
we believe that diversification into other industrial markets provides opportunities for improved operating margins with products that are complementary in nature to our current manufacturing processes 
in addition  we believe that our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities enable us to position ourselves for product expansion 
utilization of manufacturing capacity efficiency utilization since we own a majority of our operating facilities  the acquisition and consolidation of adorn into patrick allowed us to increase capacity utilization at all of our consolidated manufacturing facilities 
in  we completed two plant expansion initiatives which were started in prior to the market declines  to allow for the increased volumes taken on at these operating facilities and to improve workflow and deliver efficiencies 
additionally  we are focused on cross training all of our manufacturing work force in our manufacturing cells within each facility to maximize our efficiencies and increase the flexibility of our labor force 
while we increased capacity utilization as a result of our facility consolidation  the decline in volume levels due to soft industry conditions in all of the major end markets we serve has left us with unused capacity 
we have the ability to substantially increase volumes in almost all of our facilities without adding comparable incremental fixed costs 
with the expected continued weak economic conditions  we are continually exploring opportunities for further facility consolidation 
plant consolidations closures and division changes in and in the first quarter of  we consolidated and closed certain manufacturing and distribution facilities in an effort to align operating costs with our revenue base and keep our overhead structure at a level consistent with operating needs  particularly given the overall soft economic conditions experienced in and further expected in during the first quarter of  the company entered into a listing agreement to sell an idle manufacturing facility in fontana  california  which was exited in in the second quarter of  this facility was sold  resulting in a pretax gain on sale of approximately million 
the building that was sold formerly housed the company s west coast molding division 
in  the company consolidated this molding division into its fontana custom vinyls and distribution facility 
the consolidation was part of a multiphase integration effort following the acquisition of adorn 
additionally during the first quarter of  the company closed its sun adhesives division located in our decatur  alabama facility 
due to the ever increasing demand for technical expertise and the economies of scale related to being able to consolidate its purchases  the company was able to improve profitability and eliminate certain fixed costs by negotiating a new nationwide agreement with a leading supplier of bonding systems to supply adhesives to all of our manufacturing facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a listing agreement to sell its remaining manufacturing and distribution facility in fontana  california 
the company will continue to assess the market conditions in california for its products and if appropriate will move to a leased facility in the event of a sale of this property 
the company has reclassified approximately million of carrying value for this facility to assets held for sale in the consolidated financial statements at december  and expects that the property will be sold in additionally during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a listing agreement to sell its custom vinyls manufacturing facility in ocala  florida 
it is anticipated that the sale of this facility will not be completed until due to unfavorable real estate market conditions  and therefore the property s carrying value was not included in assets held for sale at december  in december  the company announced its decision to close its leased distribution facility in woodland  california and consolidate operations into the existing fontana  california facility in order to offset a sizable reduction in sales volumes that stemmed from the planned closure of one of our major customers plants in the same location 
the consolidation was completed in january in january in conjunction with the sale of the american hardwoods operation  the company entered into a separate real estate purchase agreement with the buyer to sell the building that housed this operation 
the agreement includes a purchase price of million for the building and property and is subject to confirmatory due diligence by the buyer and is expected to be finalized by the end of the second quarter of the company accordingly reclassified approximately million of carrying value for this property to assets held for sale in the company s consolidated financial statements at december  product development and new product introductions discontinuations with our versatile manufacturing and distribution capabilities  we are continually striving to increase our market presence in all of the markets that we serve and gain entrance into other potential markets 
we remain committed to new product development and introduction initiatives 
new product development is critical to growing our revenue base and keeping up with changing market conditions and addressing customer demand 
we plan to continue to devote our time and attention to distribution products that fit within the strategic parameters of our current business model including appropriate margin and inventory turn levels 
in and early  we introduced several new products 
to further enhance our product offerings to marine and rv customers  we established new relationships with several vendors to distribute a complete line of audio video source units  televisions and microwaves to the marine  rv and recreational product markets 
this newly formed electronics division within our distribution segment was launched in the first quarter of in january  we discontinued certain distribution product lines including our line of resilient flooring products and the hardwood products associated with the american hardwoods operation 
principal products through our manufacturing divisions  we manufacture a variety of products including decorative vinyl and paper panels  wrapped moldings  stiles and battens  hardwood  foil and membrane pressed cabinet doors  drawer sides and bottoms  slotwall and slotwall components  components for electronic desks  countertops  and printed decorative vinyl and paper 
in conjunction with our manufacturing capabilities  we also provide value added processes  including custom fabrication  edge banding  drilling  and cut to size capabilities 
we distribute pre finished wall and ceiling panels  drywall and drywall finishing products  floor covering products  particleboard  vinyl and cement siding  interior passage doors  roofing products  decorative tile  mirrors and glass  electronics  insulation  and other related products 
manufactured laminated panels contributed   and of total sales for the years ended december    and  respectively 
pre finished wall panels and finishing products contributed   and of total sales for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we have no material patents  licenses  franchises  or concessions and do not conduct significant research and development activities 
manufacturing processes and operations our primary manufacturing facilities utilize various materials including gypsum  particleboard  plywood and fiberboard  which are bonded by adhesives or a heating process to a number of products  including vinyl  paper  foil and high pressure laminate 
additionally  we offer high pressure laminate laminated to substrates such as particleboard and lauan which has many uses  including counter tops and ambulance cabinetry 
we manufacture laminate countertops and solid surface countertops  as well as slotwall and slotwall components for the store and office fixture markets 
laminated products are used in the production of wall  cabinet  shelving  counter and fixture products with a wide variety of finishes and textures 
we manufacture three distinct cabinet door product lines in both raised and flat panel designs  as well as square  cathedral and arched panels 
one product line is manufactured from raw lumber using solid oak  maple and other hardwood materials 
another line of doors is made of laminated fiberboard  and a third line uses membrane press technology to produce doors and components with vinyls ranging from mil to mil in thickness 
several outside profiles are available on square  cathedral  and arched raised panel doors and the components include rosettes  arched window trim  blocks and windowsills  among others 
our doors are sold mainly to the mh and rv industries 
we also market to the cabinet manufacturers and ready to assemble furniture manufacturers 
our vinyl printing facility produces a wide variety of decorative vinyls which range from mil to mil in thickness and are shipped in rolls ranging from yards in length 
this facility produces material for both internal and external use 
our aluminum extrusion operation  which is classified as held for sale on our december  consolidated statements of financial position  produces semi fabricated and fabricated aluminum extrusions for structural and non structural applications 
markets we are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and material for use primarily by the mh and rv industries  and in other industrial markets 
the current downturn in the residential housing market has had an adverse impact on our operations as the three primary industries in which we operate are experiencing overall declines that are expected to continue through and potentially into the manufactured housing industry continues to be negatively impacted by financing concerns and a lack of available financing sources  and the current credit situation in the residential housing market puts additional pressure on consumers  who are generally using financial institutions and conventional financing as a source for these purchases 
recreational vehicle purchases are generally consumer discretionary income purchases  and therefore any situation which causes concerns related to discretionary income has a negative impact on these markets 
approximately of our industrial revenue base is associated with the us residential housing market  and therefore there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing production 
manufactured housing the manufactured housing industry has historically served as a more affordable alternative to the traditional homebuyer 
because of the relative lower cost of construction as compared to site built homes  manufactured homes traditionally have been one of the principal means for first time homebuyers to overcome the obstacles of large down payments and higher monthly mortgage payments 
manufactured housing also presents an affordable alternative to site built homes for retirees and others desiring a lifestyle in which home ownership is less burdensome than in the case of site built homes 
the increase in square footage of living space and updated modern designs in manufactured homes created by multi sectional models has made them more attractive to a larger segment of homebuyers 
manufactured homes are built in accordance with national  state and local building codes 
manufactured homes are factory built and transported to a site where they are installed  often permanently 
some manufactured homes have design limitations imposed by the constraints of efficient production and over the road transit 
delivery expense limits the effective competitive shipping range of the manufactured homes to approximately to miles 
modular homes  which are a component of the manufactured housing industry  are factory built homes that are built in sections and transported to the site for installation 
these homes are generally set on a foundation and are subject to land home financing terms and conditions 
in recent years  these units have been gaining in popularity due to their aesthetic similarity to site built homes and their relatively less expensive cost  as well as their less restrictive access to financing when compared to the chattel lending market 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and is affected by the availability of alternative housing  such as apartments  town houses  condominiums and site built housing 
in addition  interest rates  availability of financing  regional population  employment trends  and general regional economic conditions affect the sale of manufactured homes 
the manufactured housing industry has been operating at the cyclical low point of the cycle over the past nine years where shipments steadily decreased on an annual basis from to the shipment statistics showed improvement which was aided by the increased demand for fema units as a result of the hurricane damage in the southeast in the third quarter of the levels unfortunately reverted back to the lowest levels in more than years at approximately  units or less than in and levels fell even further to finish at approximately  units and  units  respectively 
from its most recent highs in to its current lows in  shipments have declined approximately 
the company currently projects unit shipments for full year to decline by approximately when compared to levels 
we believe that the factors responsible for the most recent declines include lack of available financing and access to the asset backed securities markets  high vacancy rates in apartments  high levels of repossessed inventories  over built housing markets in certain regions of the country that resulted in fewer sales of new manufactured homes  as well as the generally depressed economic environment 
additionally  low conventional mortgage rates and less restrictive lending terms for residential site built housing have contributed to the decline as manufactured home loans and chattel mortgage loans generally carry a higher interest rate and less competitive terms 
beginning in mid and continuing through  the mh industry has also had to contend with credit requirements that became more stringent and a reduction in availability of lenders for manufactured homes for both retail and dealers 
while there is demand for permanent rebuilding in the hurricane damaged areas  credit conditions remain adverse especially in conjunction with the current credit crisis  and current overall economic conditions are not favorable in relation to the factors which will promote positive growth 
the availability of financing and access to the asset backed securities market is still restricted  and we believe that employment growth and standard quality oriented lending practices in the conventional site built housing markets are needed to enable more balanced demand  thus resulting in the potential for increased production and shipment levels in the mh industry 
the following chart reflects the historical shipment levels in the mh industry from through per the manufactured housing institute 
imggif 
recreational vehicles the recreational vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand reflecting prevailing general economic conditions which affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
in the past  fluctuations in interest rates  consumer confidence  and concerns about the availability and price of gasoline  have had an adverse impact on rv sales 
from  the industry experienced increased demand as a result of an increasing number of baby boomers reaching retirement age  continued growth in disposable incomes  and low inflation and low interest rates 
increased gasoline prices over the past five years appear to have adversely impacted the sales of motorized units 
marked the fourth largest shipment level in years despite an approximate shipment decline for all rv s compared to shipment levels in declined approximately versus  reflecting tighter credit conditions  higher unemployment levels  slower growth in real incomes  higher average gasoline prices  and rapid declining consumer confidence  specifically in the latter half of the year 
according to the recreational vehicle industry association s rvia chief economist  unit shipments are expected to decline in as well with the lowest point in the first quarter of  as credit restrictions  declining consumer confidence  and reduced disposable income levels are causing rv dealers to keep inventories low and rv buyers to delay purchases as their priorities have shifted away from spending and toward debt repayment and the restoration of their savings and retirement funds 
demographic and ownership trends point to favorable market growth in the long term as the number of baby boomers reaching retirement is steadily increasing  products such as sports utility rv s are becoming attractive to younger buyers  and rv manufacturers are producing lightweight towables and smaller  fuel efficient motorhomes 
in addition  federal economic credit and stimulus packages that contain provisions to stimulate rv lending and provide favorable tax treatment for new rv purchases  may help promote sales and aid in the rv industry s economic recovery 
recreational vehicle classifications are based upon standards established by the rvia 
the principal types of recreational vehicles include conventional travel trailers  folding camping trailers  fifth wheel trailers  motor homes  and conversion vehicles 
these recreational vehicles are distinct from mobile homes  which are manufactured houses designed for permanent and semi permanent residential dwelling 
conventional travel trailers and folding camping trailers are non motorized vehicles designed to be towed by passenger automobiles  pick up trucks  or vans 
they provide comfortable  self contained living facilities for short periods of time 
conventional travel trailers and folding camping trailers are towed by means of a frame hitch attached to the towing vehicle 
fifth wheel trailers  designed to be towed by pick up trucks  are constructed with a raised forward section that is attached to the bed area of the pick up truck 
this allows for a bi level floor plan and more living space than a conventional travel trailer 
a motor home is a self powered vehicle built on a motor vehicle chassis 
the interior typically includes a driver s area  kitchen  bathroom  dining  and sleeping areas 
motor homes are self contained with their own lighting  heating  cooking  refrigeration  sewage holding  and water storage facilities 
although they are not designed for permanent or semi permanent living  motor homes do provide comfortable living facilities for short periods of time 
sales of recreational vehicle products have been cyclical 
shortages of motor vehicle fuels and significant increases in fuel prices have had a material adverse effect on the market for recreational vehicles in the past  and could adversely affect demand in the future 
the recreational vehicle industry is also affected by the availability and terms of financing to dealers and retail purchasers 
substantial increases in interest rates and decreases in the general availability of credit have had a negative impact upon the industry in the past and may do so in the future 
recession and lack of consumer confidence generally result in a decrease in the sale of leisure time products such as recreational vehicles 
the period beginning in and continuing through resulted in eight out of the nine years with shipment levels over  units primarily due to the favorable demographic trend of the aging baby boomer population  improved consumer confidence  depleted dealer inventories  lower interest rates  and a fear of flying after the september  terrorist attacks 
the damage from the hurricanes in the southeast in the third quarter of resulted in increased demand for temporary housing and it is estimated that almost  incremental units were shipped to support the fema orders from september through december the fema shipments  while at a lower rate  continued into the first quarter of shipment levels started to soften in the third and fourth quarters of and into shipments declined from the levels  but still remained at historically high levels 
in  shipment levels declined approximately to  units reflecting the tightest credit conditions in several decades  higher interest rates  declining consumer confidence  reduced disposable income levels and the generally depressed economic environment 
while demographic trends point to positive conditions for this particular market sector in the foreseeable future  the rvia s chief economist currently forecasts unit shipment levels declining by approximately to  units  citing the overall uncertainty surrounding economic conditions  including the ongoing recession and tight credit restrictions 
the company estimates that approximately of its revenues related to the rv industry are derived from the towables sector of the market 
the towable units are lighter and less expensive than standard gas or diesel powered units representing a more attractive solution for the cost conscious buyer 
from to  motorized unit shipments declined approximately and towable unit shipments declined approximately 
we believe that we are well positioned with respect to our product mix within the rv industry to take advantage of any improved market conditions 
the following chart reflects the historical shipment levels in the rv industry from through per rvia statistics 
imggif 
other markets many of our core products  including paper vinyl laminated panels  shelving  drawer sides  and high pressure laminated panels are routinely utilized in the kitchen cabinet  store fixture and commercial furnishings  and home and office furniture markets 
these markets are generally categorized by a more performance than price driven customer base  and provide an opportunity for us to diversify our clientele while providing increased contribution to our core laminating and fabricating competencies 
while the residential furniture markets have been severely impacted by import pressures  other segments have been less vulnerable  and therefore provide opportunities for increased sales penetration and market share gains 
demand in the industrial markets in which the company competes also fluctuates with economic cycles 
industrial demand tends to lag the housing cycle by six to twelve months  and will vary based on differences in regional economic prospects 
as a result  we believe continued focus on industrial markets will reduce our reliance on the mh rv markets and moderate the impact of their cyclical patterns on our operating results 
we have the available capacity to increase industrial revenue and benefit from the diversity of multiple market segments  unique regional economies and varied customer strategies 
marketing and distribution our sales are to manufactured housing and recreational vehicle manufacturers and other industrial products manufacturers 
we have approximately customers 
we have six customers  who together accounted for approximately and of our total sales in and  respectively 
we believe we have good relationships with our customers 
sales to two different customers in the primary manufactured products  distribution and other component manufactured products segments accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated net sales of the company for the year ended december  no one customer accounted for or more of consolidated net sales for the years ended december  or products for distribution are purchased in carload or truckload quantities  warehoused  and then sold and delivered by us 
approximately and of our distribution segment s products were shipped directly from the suppliers to our customers in and  respectively 
we typically experience a one to two week delay between issuing our purchase orders and the delivery of products to our warehouses or customers 
as lead times have declined over the years  in some instances  certain customers have required same day or next day service 
we generally keep backup supplies of various commodity products in our warehouses to ensure that we have product on hand at all times for our distribution customers 
our customers do not maintain long term supply contracts  and therefore we must bear the risk of accurate advanced estimation of customer orders 
we maintain an inventory to satisfy these orders 
we have no significant backlog of orders 
we operate warehouse and distribution centers and manufacturing operations located in alabama  arizona  california  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kansas  minnesota  north carolina  oregon  pennsylvania  tennessee and texas 
through the use of these facilities  we are able to minimize our in transit delivery time and cost to the regional manufacturing plants of our customers 
patrick does not engage in significant marketing efforts nor does it incur significant marketing or advertising expenditures other than the activities of its sales personnel and the maintenance of customer relationships through price  quality of its products  service and customer satisfaction 
suppliers during the year ended december   we purchased approximately of our raw materials and distributed products from twenty different suppliers 
the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately of our purchases 
our current major material suppliers with contracts include united states gypsum through december   and masonite through december  we have terms and conditions with these and other suppliers that specify exclusivity in certain areas  pricing structures  rebate agreements and other parameters 
materials are primarily commodity products  such as lauan  gypsum  particleboard  and other lumber products  which are available from many suppliers 
we maintain a long term supply agreement with one of our major suppliers of materials to the mh industry 
our sales in the short term could be negatively impacted in the event any unforeseen negative circumstances were to affect our major supplier 
we believe that we have a good relationship with this supplier and all of our other suppliers 
alternate sources of supply are available for all of our major material purchases 
seasonality manufacturing operations in the mh and rv industries historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the climate is moderate 
accordingly  the company s sales and profits are generally highest in the second and third quarters 
however  depressed economic conditions in both industries distorted the historical trends in employees as of december   we had employees  of which were engaged directly in production  warehousing  and delivery operations  in sales  and in office and administrative activities 
there is one manufacturing plant and one distribution center covered by collective bargaining agreements 
patrick continuously reviews benefits and other matters of interest to its employees and considers its relations with its employees to be good

item a 
risk factors the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks related to its business 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on form k 
all of these risks should be carefully considered 
our results of operations have been  and may continue to be  adversely impacted by a worldwide macroeconomic downturn 
in  general worldwide economic conditions experienced a downturn due to the effects of the deterioration in the residential housing market  subprime lending crisis  general credit market crisis  collateral effects on the finance and banking industries  increased commodity costs  volatile energy costs  concerns about inflation  slower economic activity  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns the economic crisis 
these conditions have adversely affected demand in the three major end markets we serve the recreational vehicle  manufactured housing and industrial markets  resulting in decreased sales of our component products into these markets and could negatively affect our operations and result in lower sales  income  and cash flows 
in addition  it has become more difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and ultimately our profitability has been adversely affected 
if our business conditions continue to deteriorate  we may be forced to close and or consolidate certain of our operating facilities  sell assets  and or reduce our workforce  which may result in our incurring restructuring charges 
we cannot predict the duration of the economic crisis  the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery or the extent to which the economic crisis will continue to negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the current downturn in the residential housing market has had an adverse impact on our operations  and is expected to continue throughout the residential housing market has experienced overall declines and credit concerns that are expected to continue throughout approximately of our industrial revenue is directly or indirectly influenced by conditions in the residential housing market 
the decline in demand for residential housing and the tightening of consumer credit have lowered demand for our industrial products and have had an adverse impact on our operations as a whole 
in addition  the impact of the sub prime mortgage crisis and housing downturn on consumer confidence  discretionary spending  and general economic conditions has decreased and may continue to decrease demand for our products sold to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries 
we may incur significant charges or be adversely impacted by the closure of all or part of a manufacturing facility 
we periodically assess the cost structure of our manufacturing facilities to manufacture and sell our products in the most efficient manner 
based on our assessments  we may make capital investments to move  discontinue manufacturing capabilities  or close all or part of a manufacturing facility 
these changes could result in significant future charges or disruptions in our operations  and we may not achieve the expected benefits from these investments which could result in an adverse impact on our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the financial condition of our customers and suppliers may deteriorate as a result of the current economic environment and competitive conditions in their markets 
the economic crisis may lead to increased levels of restructurings  bankruptcies  liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers  suppliers and other service providers and financial institutions with whom we do business 
such events could  in turn  negatively affect our business either through loss of sales or inability to meet our commitments or inability to meet them without excess expense because of loss of suppliers or other providers 
in addition  several of our major customers are undergoing unprecedented financial distress which may result in such customers undergoing major restructuring  reorganization or other significant changes 
the occurrence of any such event could have further adverse consequences to our business including a decrease in demand for our products 
if such customers become insolvent or file for bankruptcy  our ability to recover accounts receivables from that customer would be adversely affected and any payments we received in the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially recoverable by the bankruptcy trustee 
many of our customers participate in highly competitive markets  and their financial condition may deteriorate as a result 
a decline in the financial condition of our customers could hinder the company s ability to collect amounts owed by customers 
in addition  such a decline could result in lower demand for the company s products and services 
we have a number of large customers  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we have a number of customers which account for a significant percentage of our net sales 
specifically  two customers of the rv segment accounted for a combined  and another customer of the mh segment accounted for of consolidated net sales in the loss of any of these large customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we do not have long term agreements with customers and cannot predict that we will maintain our current relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply them at current levels 
in addition  if any of our significant customers were to encounter financial difficulties  work stoppages or seek bankruptcy protection  our business could be adversely affected 
the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries are highly competitive  and some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do 
we operate in a highly competitive business environment and our sales could be negatively impacted by our inability to maintain or increase prices  changes in geographic or product mix  or the decision of our customers to purchase our competitors products instead of our products 
we compete not only with other suppliers to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle producers  but also with suppliers to traditional site built homebuilders and suppliers of cabinetry and flooring 
sales could also be affected by pricing  purchasing  financing  advertising  operational  promotional  or other decisions made by purchasers of our products 
additionally  we cannot control the decisions made by suppliers of our distributed and manufactured products and therefore our ability to maintain our exclusive and non exclusive distributor contracts and agreements may be adversely impacted 
as a result of highly competitive market conditions in the industries in which we participate  some of our competitors have been forced to seek bankruptcy protection 
these competitors may emerge from bankruptcy protection with stronger balance sheets and a desire to gain market share by offering their products at a lower price than our products  which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 
seasonality and cyclical economic conditions affect the markets the company serves 
the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle markets are cyclical and dependent upon various factors  including the general level of economic activity  consumer confidence  interest rates  access to financing  inventory and production levels  and the cost of fuel 
economic and demographic factors can cause substantial fluctuations in production  which in turn impact sales and operating results 
demand for recreational vehicles and manufactured housing generally declines during the winter season 
our sales levels and operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in any of these items 
the cyclical nature of the domestic housing market has caused our sales and operating results to fluctuate 
these fluctuations may continue in the future  which could result in operating losses during downturns 
the us housing industry is highly cyclical and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors  including terms and availability of financing for homebuyers and retailers  consumer confidence  interest rates  population and employment trends  income levels  housing demand  and general economic conditions  including inflation  deflation and recessions 
the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries and the industrial markets are affected by the fluctuations in the residential housing market 
as a result of the foregoing factors  our sales and operating results fluctuate  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
moreover  cyclical and seasonal downturns in the residential housing market may cause us to experience operating losses 
fuel shortages  or higher prices for fuel  have had  and could continue to have  an adverse impact on our operations 
the products produced by the recreational vehicle industry typically require gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation  or the use of a vehicle requiring gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation 
there can be no assurance that the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel will continue uninterrupted or that the price of or tax on fuel will not significantly increase in the future 
shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel have had a significant adverse effect on the demand for recreational vehicles in the past and would be expected to have a material adverse effect on demand in the future 
rapid significant increases in fuel prices  as we experienced in recent years  appear to affect the demand for recreational vehicles when gasoline prices reach unusually high levels and we believe the significant increase in fuel prices in and the first half of contributed to the decrease in demand for recreational vehicles 
such a reduction in overall demand for recreational vehicles could have a materially adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
approximately and of our sales were to the recreational vehicle industry for and for  respectively 
dependence on third party suppliers and manufacturers 
generally  our raw materials  supplies and energy requirements are obtained from various sources and in the quantities desired 
while alternative sources are available  our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in the delivery 
fluctuations in the prices of these requirements may be driven by the supply demand relationship for that commodity or governmental regulation 
in addition  if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated  the availability or price of these requirements could be adversely affected 
increased cost and limited availability of raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
prices of certain materials  including gypsum  lauan  particleboard  mdf  and other commodity products  can be volatile and change dramatically with changes in supply and demand 
certain products are purchased from overseas and are dependent upon vessel shipping schedules and port availability 
further  certain of our commodity product suppliers sometimes operate at or near capacity  resulting in some products having the potential of being put on allocation 
we generally have been able to maintain adequate supplies of materials and to pass higher material costs on to our customers in the form of surcharges and base price increases where needed 
however  it is not certain that future price increases can be passed on to our customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities 
the current credit crisis and its impact on the financial and housing markets may also impact our suppliers and affect the availability or pricing of materials 
our sales levels and operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in any of these items 
the ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and key personnel may adversely affect our operations 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could reduce our ability to manage our business and strategic plan in the short term and could cause our sales and operating results to decline 
our ability to integrate acquired businesses may adversely affect operations 
as part of our business and strategic plan  we look for strategic acquisitions to provide shareholder value 
in  we acquired adorn 
this acquisition  and any future acquisitions  requires the effective integration of an existing business and its administrative  financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing and other functions to maximize synergies 
acquired businesses involve a number of risks that may affect our financial performance  including increased leverage  diversion of management resources  assumption of liabilities of the acquired businesses  and possible corporate culture conflicts 
if we are unable to successfully integrate these acquisitions  we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process  and our financial results may be negatively impacted 
additionally  significant unexpected liabilities could arise from these acquisitions 
increased levels of indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
on may   we entered into a senior secured credit agreement as amended on march   the credit agreement  providing for a senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility 
borrowings under our senior secured credit facility were used to finance the adorn acquisition  to provide liquidity for the working capital needs of the combined companies  and to repay borrowings under our previous credit facility 
on december   we amended our credit agreement which amendment is more fully described below the amended credit agreement and  as a result  our senior secured credit facility was comprised of a revolving line of credit subject to a borrowing base  up to a borrowing limit of million and a million term loan and expires on january  on april   the company entered into a third amendment and waiver the third amendment which amendment is more fully described below and  as a result  our senior secured credit facility is comprised of a revolving line of credit subject to a borrowing base  up to a borrowing limit of million and a term loan 
the principal amount outstanding under the term loan  the interest rates for borrowings under the revolving line of credit and the term loan  and the expiration date of the credit agreement remained unchanged under the amended terms 
our increased indebtedness as a result of the adorn acquisition  as well as our greater need for working capital  may harm our financial condition and negatively impact our results of operations 
the increase in our level of indebtedness could have consequences on our future operations  including i making it more difficult for us to meet our payments on other outstanding debt  ii an event of default  if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements  which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable  iii reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  iv limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  v placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged  and vi creating concerns about our credit quality which could result in the loss of supplier contracts and or customers 
the terms of the third amendment to the credit agreement contain various financial performance and other covenants with which we must remain in compliance 
if we do not remain in compliance with these covenants  our amended credit agreement could be terminated and the amounts outstanding thereunder could become immediately due and payable 
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding that contains financial and non financial covenants with which we must comply that place restrictions on our subsidiaries and us 
at march  february month end  the company was in violation of its consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda financial covenant under the terms of the credit agreement that was amended in december on april   the company entered into a third amendment to the credit agreement which included a waiver of any actual or potential event of default and amended and or added certain definitions  terms and reporting requirements 
without improvements from the conditions in the current economic crisis in there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with our financial covenants  which were modified in december and again in april these covenants are measured on a monthly basis and require that we attain minimum levels of consolidated ebitda as defined by our credit agreement 
if we fail to comply with our covenants under the third amendment  the lenders could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity or it could result in our having to refinance the related indebtedness under unfavorable terms 
if our debt were accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full 
if current unfavorable credit market conditions were to persist throughout  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness 
for additional details and discussion concerning these financial covenants see liquidity and capital resources in item of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements 
industry conditions and our operating results have limited our sources of capital in the past 
if we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed  we may be unable to maintain or expand our business 
we depend on our cash balances  borrowings against our corporate owned life insurance  our cash flows from operations and our amended credit agreement to finance our operating requirements  capital expenditures and other needs 
if the economic conditions that prevailed during the latter part of and the first quarter of continue or worsen  production of rvs and manufactured homes will likely decline even further  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
a further decline in our operating results could negatively impact our liquidity 
in addition  the downturn in the mh and rv industries  combined with our operating results and other changes  has limited our sources of financing in the past 
if our cash balances  cash flows from operations  and availability under our amended credit agreement are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available  we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions  or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations 
we have letters of credit representing collateral for our casualty insurance programs and for general operating purposes 
the letters of credit are issued under our amended credit agreement 
for additional detail and information concerning the amounts of our letters of credit  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the inability to retain our current letters of credit  to obtain alternative letter of credit sources or to retain our current amended credit agreement to support these programs could require us to post cash collateral  reduce the amount of cash available for our operations or cause us to curtail or limit existing operations 
increased levels of inventory may adversely affect our profitability 
our customers generally do not maintain long term supply contracts and  therefore  we must bear the risk of advanced estimation of customer orders 
we maintain an inventory to support these customers needs 
changes in demand  market conditions and or product specifications could result in material obsolescence and a lack of alternative markets for certain of our customer specific products and could negatively impact operating results 
we may be subject to additional charges for impairment of assets  including goodwill  other long lived assets and deferred tax assets  due to potential declines in the fair value of those assets or a decline in expected profitability of the company or individual reporting units of the company 
a portion of our total assets as of december  was comprised of goodwill  amortizable intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment 
under generally accepted accounting principles  each of these assets is subject to periodic review and testing to determine whether the asset is recoverable or realizable 
the events or changes that could require us to test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment include a reduction in our stock price and market capitalization and changes in our estimated future cash flows  as well as changes in rates of growth in our industry or in any of our reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  unfavorable economic conditions and trends in the industries in which we operate significantly contributed to declines in our market capitalization 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a test for impairment for each of these assets 
the result of the impairment test and an independent third party appraisal indicated that a majority of our goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired 
as a result  non cash pretax impairment charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of for million related to goodwill and million for other intangible assets 
in addition  in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a test for impairment of certain long lived assets and determined that certain property  plant and equipment fixed assets were impaired 
a non cash pretax charge was recorded for million in the fourth quarter of in the future  if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
significant impairment charges  although not always affecting current cash flow  could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
a variety of factors could influence fluctuations in the market price for our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future in response to a number of factors  including those discussed below 
the market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate 
some of the factors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate include variations in our and our competitors operating results  historically low trading volume  high concentration of shares held by institutional investors and in particular our majority shareholder  tontine capital partners  lp and affiliates collectively  tontine capital  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  the gain or loss of significant customers  additions or departure of key personnel  events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us  general conditions in industries in which we operate  general conditions in the united states and abroad  the presence or absence of short selling of our common stock  future sales of our common stock or debt securities  announcements by us or our competitors of technological improvements or new products  and the disclosure by tontine capital that it will begin to explore alternatives for the disposition of its equity interests in the company 
fluctuations in the stock market may have an adverse effect upon the price of our common stock 
the stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations 
these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we may not be in compliance with nasdaq s continued listing standards for the nasdaq global market because the average closing share price of patrick s common stock for a consecutive day trading period has fallen below and the market value of our publicly held shares is below  although the nasdaq has suspended its listing requirements through april  and we have not received notice of non compliance from nasdaq  the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market is at risk as a result of our average closing share price falling below per share over a consecutive day trading period 
the company would have a period of days from the date it receives notice to cure this non compliance  and could request a hearing to stay the delisting 
our listing on the nasdaq global market is also at risk as a result of the failure to have an aggregate of  of public market value 
for purposes of this calculation  shares of common stock held by officers  directors and beneficial owners of or more of our common stock such as tontine capital are excluded 
following issuance of a deficiency notice  the company would have days to achieve compliance 
while we have a number of options to cure under consideration  there can be no assurance that we will be able to cure a deficiency in the time permitted 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that the company will remain in compliance with other continued listing requirements related to market capitalization and shareholder s equity 
in the current environment  there can be no assurance that we will not be in violation of other nasdaq global market listing standards  which may not be curable 
in the event the company s common stock is delisted from the nasdaq stock exchange  there are additional risks such as the impact on the market liquidity of our common stock  the impact on our ability to raise capital or issue certain types of debt  and general issues regarding our perception in the marketplace 
holders of our common stock are subject to the risk of dilution of their investment as the result of the issuance to our lenders of warrants to purchase common stock 
as part of the consideration for amending our credit agreement on december   we entered into a warrant agreement under which we issued to our lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of the warrants 
the warrants are immediately exercisable  subject to anti dilution provisions and expire on december  the exercise of the warrants would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock 
ownership of a significant portion of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of a few holders 
on march   tontine capital owned  shares of our common stock or approximately of our total common stock outstanding 
in addition  we were aware of six other institutions that collectively own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  in november  tontine capital disclosed that it will begin to explore alternatives for the disposition of certain of its holdings  including its holdings of our common stock 
we are not able to predict whether or when tontine capital or the other institutions will sell or otherwise dispose of substantial amounts of our common stock 
sales or other dispositions of our common stock by these institutions could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
a majority of our common stock is held by tontine capital  which has the ability to control all matters requiring shareholder approval and whose interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
on march   tontine capital held approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of its majority interest  tontine capital has the ability to control all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of our directors  the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation  the approval of mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  decisions affecting our capital structure and other significant corporate transactions 
in addition to its majority interest  pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with tontine capital  dated april   if tontine capital i holds between and of our common stock then outstanding  tontine capital has the right to appoint one nominee to our board  or ii holds at least of our common stock then outstanding  tontine capital has the right to appoint two nominees to our board 
tontine capital s rights related to the appointment of directors were affirmed in a subsequent securities purchase agreement with tontine capital  dated march  on july   a nominee of tontine capital was appointed to the board 
as of march   tontine capital has not exercised its right to nominate a second director to the board 
the interests of tontine capital may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
the influence of tontine capital may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers  delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management  or limiting the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 
in addition  tontine capital and its affiliates are in the business of investing in companies and may  from time to time  invest in companies that compete directly or indirectly with us 
tontine capital and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and  as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
tontine capital has indicated in a filing with the sec that it will begin to explore alternatives for the disposition of its equity interests in the company 
this filing  and any future dispositions of stock by tontine capital  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
on november   tontine capital filed with the sec an amendment to its previously filed schedule d with respect to its ownership of common stock of the company 
tontine capital stated that it will begin to explore alternatives for the disposition of its equity interests in the company  which alternatives may include a dispositions of our common stock through open market sales  underwritten offerings and or privately negotiated sales  b a sale of the company  or c distributions by tontine capital of its shares to its investors 
the public disclosure of such possible disposition may adversely affect the market price for our common stock due to the large number of shares involved 
in addition  we are not able to predict whether or when tontine capital will dispose of its stock 
any such future disposition of stock by tontine capital may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws may delay  defer or prevent a change in control that our shareholders each might consider to be in their best interest 
our articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them unacceptably expensive to the raider  and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
on march   our board adopted a rights agreement with national city bank as our rights agent the rights agreement 
the rights agreement permits under certain circumstances each holder of common stock  other than potential acquirors  to purchase one one hundredth of a share of a newly created series of our preferred stock at a purchase price of or to acquire additional shares of our common stock at of the current market price 
the rights are not exercisable or transferable until a person or group acquires or more of our outstanding common stock  except with respect to tontine capital and its affiliates and associates  which are exempt from the provisions of the rights agreement pursuant to an amendment signed on march  insurance coverages and terms and conditions 
we negotiate our insurance contracts annually for property  casualty  workers compensation  general liability  health insurance  and directors and officers liability coverage 
due to conditions within these insurance markets and other factors beyond our control  future coverage limits  terms and conditions and the amount of the related premiums could have a negative impact on our operating results 
while we continually measure the risk reward of policy limits and coverage  the lack of coverage in certain circumstances could result in potential uninsured losses

patrick s major manufactured products include decorative vinyl and paper panels  wrapped moldings  cabinet doors and components  slotwall and slotwall components  countertops  and printed vinyl 
the company also distributes drywall and drywall finishing products  interior passage doors  floor covering products  roofing products  vinyl and cement siding  ceramic tile  and other miscellaneous products 
the company has three reportable business segments primary manufactured products  distribution and other component manufactured products  each of which contributed approximately  and  respectively  to net sales 
in an effort to strategically align our current operations with businesses within our core competencies and reduce overall fixed costs  we explored various alternatives for the divestiture of certain unprofitable  non core operations 
in  we identified american hardwoods  inc american hardwoods and our aluminum extrusion operation as non core operations 
in january  we purchased the assets of american hardwoods  an industrial hardwood product distributor located in phoenix  arizona 
in january  the company sold certain assets and the business of american hardwoods for cash consideration of million  and entered into a separate real estate purchase agreement with the buyer to sell the building that housed this operation  subject to certain conditions 
since early  the downturn in general worldwide economic conditions adversely affected the demand for building products in the phoenix market and  ultimately  the sales volume from this operation 
previously  the american hardwoods financial results had been included in our distribution segment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company made the decision to divest its aluminum extrusion operation located in mishawaka  indiana 
previously  the financial results of this operation had comprised the entire engineered solutions business segment 
estimated pretax charges of approximately million associated with the planned divesture are reflected in discontinued operations 
the decision to divest american hardwoods and the aluminum extrusion operation was largely based on projected and potential losses under the current operating model  along with working capital requirements  that forced us to assess the overall fit of these operations within the parameters of our strategic plan 
during the fourth quarter of  we reclassified the carrying values of american hardwoods and the aluminum extrusion operation to assets held for sale  which is included in current assets 
these operations have also been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and all prior period financial results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
overview of markets and related industry performance the year marked a continuation of the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions  resulting in a constricted lending environment with restricted capacity and availability of capital in the residential housing  rv and mh industries  rapidly declining consumer confidence and discretionary spending  increasing commodity costs  volatile energy prices  and liquidity concerns  all of which had a negative impact on the company s sales and a major impact on all three of the major markets the company serves 
the conditions in the residential housing market  which play a significant role in consumer confidence and discretionary spending as it relates to the products we sell  experienced significant declines from an extended period of prosperity due in part to weak credit standards in the residential housing market and excessive home prices resulting in an overall tightening of credit by the lenders  excess inventory levels of unsold homes in the marketplace resulting in less new construction  and a general skepticism by consumers resulting in less discretionary spending 
the company expects the depressed conditions in the rv  mh and residential housing markets to continue through and possibly into as certain customers of the company are closing and consolidating facilities  reducing workforce  reducing inventory levels  and reducing costs 
in addition  the company s sales will continue to be negatively impacted as rv dealers are expected to continue to lower their inventory levels which will reduce the demand for new rvs and impact sales of our products 
according to industry sources  the rv industry  which represents approximately of the company s sales  experienced unit shipment declines in all four quarters of from the prior year  and a year over year decline of approximately to finish at  units 
the year represented the first year in the last seven consecutive years that shipment levels fell below the  unit level and the second decline in the last four years 
demographic projections for the rv industry remain positive from a long term perspective as the hassles of air travel  an aging baby boomer population with more disposable income  the relatively low cost of recreational vehicle vacations  and successful product development and enhancement campaigns all point to projected long term growth for the industry 
while demographic trends point to positive conditions for this particular market sector in the foreseeable future  the rvia s chief economist currently forecasts unit shipment levels declining by approximately  citing the overall uncertainty surrounding economic conditions  including the ongoing recession and tight credit restrictions 
the mh industry  which represents approximately of our revenue base for  continued to experience shipment declines and finished the year with shipments at approximately  units  levels not seen since this industry has been plagued by financing concerns including lack of funding sources  marketing and perception issues  excess capacity in apartment units  and low interest rates and weak credit standards on traditional site built housing mortgages  which directly compete with the manufactured housing loans generally carrying a financing risk based premium 
the company currently estimates mh shipments for full year to decline approximately compared to levels 
factors that may favorably impact production levels in this industry include favorable changes in financing laws  permanent rebuilding in hurricane damaged areas  rising interest rates  quality credit standards in the residential housing market  mild inflation and improved job growth 
the industrial and other markets sector  which represented approximately of the company s sales in  has been negatively impacted by the steep decline in the residential housing market 
new housing starts for were down approximately from as reported by the us department of commerce 
the company estimates that approximately of our revenue base in these industries is tied to the residential housing market and includes kitchen cabinet and cabinet components  which relate to not only new home construction  but also remodeling and upgrades as well 
there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing production 
demand for existing homes is forecast to begin a modest recovery late in with new home sales declining overall in but beginning to recover in retail markets tend to follow housing by months  therefore we are not expecting signs of a recovery in commercial construction and retail fixtures until the weak conditions in the mh industry dramatically impacted the company s distribution segment  which saw sales decline from the prior year by approximately and operating profits decline approximately in  as approximately of the company s sales in this segment are associated with the mh industry 
additionally  pricing on gypsum related commodity products that the company sells into the mh industry was down approximately year over year on manufactured products and approximately on distribution products 
in addition  higher energy costs continue to affect the costs of raw materials 
the company continues to explore alternative sources of raw materials and components  both domestically and from overseas  and evaluate and implement sales price increases to customers where needed to offset the effect of cost increases 
more recently  we have seen cost increases softening somewhat and expect that to continue until the general economy improves 
while the company has historically been able to obtain sales price increases to offset raw material cost increases  there can be no assurance that future cost increases can be passed on to customers

during  the company paid down million in principal on its long term debt 
the debt repayments were funded by a combination of operating cash flow  the net proceeds from the previously announced sale of the idle california facility  and the company s rights offering to its shareholders 
the credit facility is subject to certain restrictive covenants that  among other things  required the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
in addition  the related agreement imposes restrictions on capital additions  additional debt  merger transactions  and the disposition of significant assets 
at december   the company was in violation of one of its financial covenants 
the company operated under a waiver of this violation until march   at which time the credit agreement was amended 
the amendments to the credit agreement modified certain financial covenants  terms and reporting requirements  and include the following provisions a for purposes of covenant calculations certain non cash and or non recurring charges are added back to consolidated ebitda as defined as approved by the lenders 
b for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio as defined as of any date prior to the first anniversary of the effective date as defined  consolidated ebitda as defined shall be adjusted to include the consolidated financial results of adorn for the period prior to the effective date as defined 
c for purposes of determining compliance with the leverage ratio covenant  the maximum leverage ratio as defined for the quarterly computation dates for the remainder of the term of the credit facility was redefined 
consistent with the proactive approach the management team has been taking to manage the business during this market downturn  the company reported in its second quarter form q that it was anticipating a third quarter violation of its leverage and fixed charge covenants under the terms of the credit agreement as a result of the deterioration in all three of the major markets it serves 
the company subsequently reported in its third quarter form q that it was in violation of those covenants at september  under the terms of the credit facility 
as these covenant violations were not cured as of the filing of our form q for the third quarter ended september   the remaining million of long term debt was reclassified to current liabilities until such time as an amended and or new credit facility could be established 
on december   the company entered into a second amendment and waiver the amendment to its senior secured credit agreement dated may  the credit agreement 
the amendment included both the addition and modification of certain definitions  terms and reporting requirements and amended the termination date of the credit agreement to expire on january  under the terms of the amendment  the lenders waived any event of default as defined in the credit agreement that resulted from the company s failure to comply with the maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenants for the computation period ended september  the financial covenants were amended to eliminate certain covenants in lieu of covenants more suited to current and expected operating conditions

the fee payable by the company on unused but committed portions of the revolving loan facility was amended to 
the company incurred approximately million in financing costs as part of this transaction 
effective with the amendment to the credit agreement on december   the interest rates on the obligation were adjusted and the company determined that its two swap agreements were ineffective as hedges against changes in interest rates and were de designated 
the company is amortizing losses on the swaps included in other comprehensive income as of the de designation date into net income loss over the life of the swaps utilizing the straight line method which approximates the effective interest method 
all future changes in the swap value will be recorded within earnings on the statements of operations 
for the year ended december   a loss of  was recognized in earnings for the portion of the changes in fair value of the ineffective swaps 
as part of the lenders consideration for the amendment  on december   the company entered into a warrant agreement under which the company issued warrants to the lenders to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  subject to adjustment  at an exercise price per share of the warrants 
the warrants are immediately exercisable  subject to anti dilution provisions and expire on december in connection with the warrants and the warrant agreement  on december   the company entered into a second amended and restated registration rights agreement the registration rights agreement with the lenders and tontine capital partners  lp and tontine capital overseas master fund  lp the registration rights agreement provides that the company shall file a registration statement on form s registering the shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of the warrants  as well as a registration statement on form s registering the shares of common stock held by tontine capital  and also provides the holders of the warrants and tontine capital certain demand registration rights and piggy back registration rights in the event the company files a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  subject to certain exceptions

c the definition of consolidated ebitda was amended to exclude the effects of losses and gains due to discontinued operations and restructuring charges  subject to approval of the administrative agent 
d the revolving commitments were reduced by million to a maximum of million 
e the monthly borrowing limits under the revolving commitments were reset in conjunction with projected monthly cash flows

g the receipt of net cash proceeds related to any asset disposition  other than proceeds attributable to inventory and receivables  will be used to pay down principal on the term loan 
effective with the third amendment  the company s credit facility consists of a term loan and a revolving line of credit 
borrowings under the revolving commitments are subject to a borrowing base  up to a borrowing limit 
the maximum borrowing limit amount was reduced from million as defined in the second amendment to the credit agreement to million 
the principal amount outstanding under the term loan at march  remained unchanged under the amended terms 
the interest rates for borrowings under the revolving line of credit and the term loan  and the expiration date of the credit agreement also remained unchanged 
the company s ability to access these borrowings is subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility including the financial covenants 
summary of liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to meet seasonal working capital demands  meet debt service requirements  and support our capital expenditure plans 
we also have a substantial asset collateral base  which we believe if sold in the normal course  is more than sufficient to cover our outstanding senior debt  and the market value of our major tangible properties exceeds the book value 
we obtain additional liquidity through selling our products and collecting receivables 
we use the funds collected to pay creditors and employees and to fund working capital needs 
the company has another source of cash through the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
as of december   the gross cash surrender value of life insurance is approximately million 
the company can borrow an estimated additional amount of million against the net cash surrender value at december  we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our current credit facility and life insurance policies will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditure programs as currently contemplated 
our current credit facility allows us to borrow funds based on certain percentages of accounts receivable of eligible accounts and inventories of eligible inventory  less outstanding letters of credit 
we are subject to market risk primarily in relation to our cash and short term investments 
the interest rate we may earn on the cash we invest in short term investments is subject to market fluctuations 
we utilize a mix of investment maturities based on our anticipated cash needs and evaluation of existing interest rates and market conditions 
while we attempt to minimize market risk and maximize return  changes in market conditions may significantly affect the income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  a portion of our debt obligations under our credit facility are currently subject to variable rates of interest based on libor 
cash  cash equivalents  and borrowings available under our credit facility are expected to be sufficient to finance the known and or foreseeable liquidity and capital needs of the company for at least the next months 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes related to the rv and mh industries  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
the level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate our businesses for the next year 
in the event that our operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would seek to revise our operating strategies accordingly 
we believe that maintaining compliance with the revised minimum one and two month consolidated ebitda covenants  as modified in the third amendment  is probable based on the company s operating plan  notwithstanding significant changes in market conditions 
management has also identified other actions within their control that could be implemented  if necessary  to help the company meet these requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
if we fail to comply with the covenants under our amended credit agreement  there can be no assurance that a majority of the lenders that are party to our credit agreement will consent to a further amendment of the credit agreement 
in this event  the lenders could cause the related indebtedness to become due and payable prior to maturity or it could result in the company having to refinance this indebtedness under unfavorable terms 
if our debt were accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full 
further  if current unfavorable credit market conditions were to persist throughout  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness 
while we will explore asset sales  divestitures and other types of capital raising alternatives in order to reduce indebtedness under the credit agreement prior to expiration of the amendment  there can be no assurance that such activities will be successful or generate cash resources adequate to retire or sufficiently reduce this indebtedness 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the future periods during which we expect to settle these obligations 
we have provided additional details about some of these obligations in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
thousands payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total revolving line of credit long term debt interest payments on debt purchase obligation deferred compensation payments building leases operating leases total contractual cash obligations the estimated long term debt payment of million in includes million of payments based on normal debt service requirements 
in addition  it is anticipated that the company will use the net proceeds from the planned sales of three buildings classified as available for sale to prepay approximately million in principal on the company s term loan 
scheduled interest payments on debt are calculated as follows a revolving line of credit interest rate in effect at december   b term loan interest rate in effect as of january   c industrial revenue bonds average interest rate of in  and d oregon and north carolina revenue bonds average weekly interest rate in of and  respectively 
the purchase obligation primarily relates to an inventory purchase commitment to be settled within one year 
we also have commercial commitments as described below in thousands other commercial commitments total amount committed outstanding at date of expiration revolving credit agreement january  letters of credit january  effective with the third amendment to the credit agreement  the total amount committed under the revolving credit agreement was reduced to million 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the commercial commitments set forth above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u 
s requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
other significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments trade receivables 
we are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and material for use primarily by the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries and other industrial markets 
trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
in assessing the carrying value of its trade receivables  the company estimates the recoverability by making assumptions based on our historical write off and collection experience and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio 
a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the future if a customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than the company s historical experience 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and  was established at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance at december  primarily reflects certain customers of the company that have closed or filed bankruptcy 
there were no material changes made to the accounting estimates for and inventories 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for inventory obsolescence of million and million was established at december  and  respectively 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
there was no material change made to the accounting estimate in impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the manufactured housing or recreational vehicle industries  and or a loss of a major customer or several customers 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and forecasts 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
a change in the company s business climate in  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  led to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  which subsequently resulted in an impairment charge of million related to machinery  furniture and equipment 
no events or changes in circumstances occurred that required the company to assess the recoverability of its property and equipment for the years ended december  and  and therefore the company has not recognized any impairment charges for those years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the impairment charge in all of the company s goodwill and long lived asset impairment assessments are based on established fair value techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis 
these analyses require management to estimate both future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the current business model 
the assumptions supporting valuation models  including discount rates  are determined using the best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty  and differences in actual future results may require further impairment charges  which may be significant 
impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
we perform the required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or more frequently if conditions warrant 
for purposes of the goodwill impairment test  the reporting units of the company are utilized  after considering the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets as amended and the relevant provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  and related interpretive literature 
the impairment tests performed by the company are based on estimates of the fair value of the company s reporting units 
the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  and or a significant decrease in the market value of the company s discounted cash flows could result in an impairment charge 
note to the consolidated financial statements sets out the impact of million of charges taken in the fourth quarter of to recognize the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and the factors which led to changes in estimates and assumptions 
significant assumptions used in our step one discounted cash flow analysis for the reporting units included a five year compound average growth rate cagr of  weighted average cost of capital of  and a terminal value growth rate of 
deferred income taxes 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these deferred tax assets 
if these assumptions change  the company may be required to record valuation allowances against its gross deferred tax assets  which would cause the company to record additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
management evaluates the potential the company will be able to realize its gross deferred tax assets and assesses the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
the company recorded a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other sale of property in  the company sold an idle manufacturing facility in fontana  california  which was exited in  resulting in a pretax gain on sale of approximately million 
the building that was sold formerly housed the company s west coast molding division 
in  the company consolidated this molding division into its fontana custom vinyls facility 
the consolidation was part of a multiphase integration effort following the acquisition of adorn 
purchase of property not applicable 
inflation the prices of key raw materials  consisting primarily of lauan  gypsum  particleboard  and aluminum are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities  such as the price of oil  rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
during periods of rising commodity prices  we have generally been able to pass the increased costs to our customers in the form of surcharges and price increases 
we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on results of operations for the periods presented
