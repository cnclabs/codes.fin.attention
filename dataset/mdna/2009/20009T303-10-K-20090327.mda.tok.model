item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the heading risk factors elsewhere herein 
general we are a diversified biotechnology business that develops proprietary technologies  including products and services in the areas of drug development  genetic analysis  molecular diagnostics  nanotechnology and defense and homeland security markets  as well as in other potential markets where our products and services could be utilized 
the technologies we have developed include a platform technology to rapidly produce user defined  in situ synthesized  oligonucleotide arrays for use in identifying and determining the roles of genes  gene mutations and proteins 
this technology has a wide range of potential applications in the areas of genomics  proteomics  biosensors  drug discovery  drug development  diagnostics  combinatorial chemistry  material sciences and nanotechnology 
other technologies include proprietary molecular synthesis and screening methods for the discovery of potential new drugs 
we currently recognize revenues from selling these products and services and providing research and development services for organizations including the us department of defense  or dod and other strategic partners 
combimatrix molecular diagnostics  inc  or cmdx  our wholly owned subsidiary located in irvine  california  has developed capabilities of producing arrays that utilize bacterial artificial chromosomes  which also enable genetic analysis 
cmdx functions primarily as a diagnostics reference laboratory 
leuchemix inc leuchemix  a minority owned subsidiary  is developing a series of compounds to address a number of oncology related diseases 
prior relationship with acacia research corporation we were originally incorporated in october as a california corporation and later reincorporated as a delaware corporation in september on december   we merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of acacia research corporation  or acacia 
on the same date  acacia entered into a recapitalization transaction whereby acacia created two classes of registered common stock ie  ar combimatrix stock and ar acacia technologies stock and divided its existing acacia common stock into shares of the two new classes of common stock 
the ar combimatrix stock was intended to reflect separately the performance of the combimatrix corporation and its subsidiaries  referred to as the combimatrix group  whereas the ar acacia technologies stock was intended to reflect separately the performance of acacia s technology business  referred to as acacia technologies group 

table of contents in december  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec to register our common stock in order to affect a split off of our company from acacia by redeeming shares of existing ar combimatrix common stock with our common stock 
the form s was declared effective by the sec on june  and on august  the redemption date  each one share of our common stock was issued in exchange for every ten shares ar combimatrix common issued and outstanding on august  the redemption ratio 
also  warrants to purchase ar combimatrix stock became exercisable to purchase combimatrix common stock  adjusted for the redemption ratio 
since the redemption date  we are no longer a subsidiary or an affiliate of acacia  and the holders of ar combimatrix became the shareholders of our company 
our common stock currently trades on the nasdaq global market under the symbol cbmx 
liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million 
as a result  we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalent balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and other sources of funding from the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to september in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond that point and ultimately to achieve profitability  we will be required to obtain capital from external sources  increase revenues and reduce operating costs 
however  there can be no assurance that such capital will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us  or that higher levels of product and service revenues will be achieved 
the issuance of additional equity securities may also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs  including research projects and personnel  of which reduction could jeopardize the future strategic initiatives and business plans of our company 
see the liquidity and capital resources section below as well as note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these matters 
basis of presentation of financial statements the consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain acacia corporate expenses through the redemption date  including governance  legal  accounting  insurance services  treasury and other acacia corporate and infrastructure costs 
the expense allocations were determined on bases that we determined with acacia to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by us and are discussed in more detail below 
overview of recent business activities during  our business activities were driven by activities in several strategic areas 
first  we executed two new development contracts with the dod totaling million to be recognized through additional appropriations for combimatrix of up to million were included in the us defense appropriations bill for the us military  and contracts related to these appropriations are expected to be executed during our diagnostics subsidiary  cmdx  launched several new diagnostic services using its constitutional genetic array test  or cgat  during the year  including the herscan and proscan tests for assessment of newly diagnosed breast cancer and prostate cancer  respectively  as well as launching updates and improvements to several of its existing tests including its hemescan  atscan and bac hd scan tests 
in october  we announced the development of our cancer screen diagnostic test  which we expect to develop over the next eighteen to twenty four months 
in march  the united states district court for the central district of california the federal court issued a judgment in favor of combimatrix in the amount of million the judgment to be paid by national union fire ins 
co 
of pittsburgh  pa national union  and later increased the award to million for attorneys fees  litigation costs and accrued interest 
the judgment is related to a lawsuit that we brought against national union  our directors and officers insurance carrier  for failing to cover 
table of contents combimatrix for litigation and settlement costs incurred by us in defending a prior lawsuit that was settled in national union has appealed the judgment  and we intend to vigorously defend against their appeal 
finally  in july  we received million in gross proceeds from selling a secured convertible debenture and warrants to a single institutional investor 
historically  we have relied primarily upon investing and financing activities to fund operating activities 
our net proceeds from investing and financing activities in were consistent with prior years and at december   our cash and cash equivalent balances  including anticipated cash flows from future operations and other existing sources of credit are not considered to be sufficient to meet our operating capital requirements beyond september we will continue to seek additional sources of capital including the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
during  our business activities were driven by the execution of a development contract with the dod totaling million to be recognized through our diagnostics subsidiary  cmdx  launched several new diagnostic services using its constitutional genetic array test  or cgat  during the year  including its hemescan test for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute lymphoblastic leukemia  as well as launching its new atscan test for the detection of autism spectrum disorder 
in may  acacia completed a registered direct offering of its ar combimatrix common stock with proceeds of million allocated to us 
as discussed elsewhere  our split off from acacia was completed in august of and our common stock began trading on nasdaq under the symbol  cbmx 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  fair value measurements  accounting for derivatives embedded in certain debt securities  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we discuss below the critical accounting assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition as described below  significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized or deferred for any period if management made different judgments 

table of contents in general  we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab no 
 when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the agreement  iii amounts are fixed or determinable and iv collectibility of amounts is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of products and services  including shipping and handling fees but excluding statutory sales taxes collected from customers as applicable  are recognized when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we sell our products and services directly to customers and also through distributors  and our right to collection is not dependent upon installation or a subsequent sale of our products to end users 
our agreements do not provide for credits  returns or exchanges with our customers or distributors 
our distribution agreements include fixed pricing arrangements for our products and after customer acceptance  there is no written or implied right to return or exchange the products 
revenues from government grants and contracts are recognized in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
 government contracts  and related pronouncements  such as statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
accordingly  revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  using the cost to cost approach to measure completeness at each reporting period 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  contract revenues and expenses are recognized in the period that work is performed based on the percentage of actual incurred costs to the total estimated contract costs 
actual contract costs include direct charges for labor and materials and indirect charges for labor  overhead and certain general and administrative charges 
contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and are considered probable 
for contracts that extend over a one year period  revisions in contract cost estimates  if they occur  have the effect of adjusting current period earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 
should current contract estimates indicate an overall future loss to be incurred  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are required primarily in connection with our accounting for multiple element arrangements with strategic partners and licensees 
we account for revenues under multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab no 
and emerging issues task force consensus  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and related pronouncements 
arrangements with multiple elements or deliverables must be segmented into individual units of accounting based on the separate deliverables only if there is objective and verifiable evidence of fair value to allocate the consideration received to the deliverables 
accordingly  revenues from multiple element arrangements involving license fees  up front payments and milestone payments  which are received and or billable in connection with other rights and services that represent our continuing obligations are deferred until all of the multiple elements have been delivered or until objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements has been established 
upon establishing objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the elements in multiple element arrangements  the fair value is allocated to each element of the arrangement  such as license fees or research and development projects  based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements based on objective and verifiable evidence of fair value  which is determined for each element based on the prices charged when the similar elements are sold separately to third parties 
if objective and verifiable evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but objective and verifiable evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the revenues from delivered elements are not recognized until the fair value of the undelivered element or elements have been determined 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period 
table of contents over which revenue should be recognized 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered to undelivered elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
deferred revenues arise from payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process 
deferred revenues expected to be recognized within the next twelve months are classified within current liabilities 
deferred revenues will be recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria as described above are met 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r sets forth the accounting requirements for share based compensation payments to employees and non employee directors and requires all share based payments to be recognized as expense in the statement of operations 
in march  the sec published staff accounting bulletin no 
 which requires stock based compensation to be classified in the same expense line items as cash compensation ie  marketing  general and administrative and research and development expenses 
the compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires significant estimates and judgments  including estimating the market price volatility of our classes of common stock and employee stock option exercise behavior 
sfas no 
r also requires stock based compensation expense to be recorded only for those awards expected to vest using an estimated pre vesting forfeiture rate 
as such  sfas no 
r requires us to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant and reflect the impact of estimated pre vesting option forfeitures on compensation expense recognized 
estimates of pre vesting forfeitures must be periodically revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we consider several factors in connection with our estimate of pre vesting forfeitures including types of awards  employee class  and historical pre vesting forfeiture data 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as cumulative adjustments in the period the estimates are revised 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
fair value measurements we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which applies to certain accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements  on january  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued a staff position that delays the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those recognized or disclosed at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provision of sfas with respect to financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
sfas clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on 
table of contents assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  sfas establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable market inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level observable market inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs where there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
management judgment is required in determining which fair value hierarchy should be used in valuing assets and liabilities on a recurring and non recurring basis 
also  with respect to level valuations  management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and valuation methods to be used 
if actual results differ from these estimates  the future impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be material 
derivatives embedded in certain debt securities we evaluate financial instruments for freestanding or embedded derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and related guidance 
derivative instruments that have been separated from the host contract and do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value with changes in value recognized in as other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change 
management judgment is required in identifying derivative instruments and whether or not such instruments should be separated and valued separately from the host contracts based upon interpretations of existing accounting literature 
also  management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and valuation methods to be used for separated derivatives 
if actual results differ from these estimates  the future impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be material 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves the estimating of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  amortization of intangibles and asset depreciation for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our valuation allowance 
after consideration of our deferred tax liabilities  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our estimates of future taxable income  the period over which our deferred tax assets may be recoverable  our history of losses and our assessment of the probability of continuing losses in the foreseeable future 
in our estimate  any positive indicators  including forecasts of potential future profitability of our businesses  are outweighed by the uncertainties surrounding our estimates and judgments of potential future taxable 
table of contents income 
if actual results differ from these estimates or if we adjust these estimates because we believe we would be able to realize these deferred tax assets in the future  then an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
any changes in the valuation allowance could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill goodwill is evaluated for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level annually  or earlier if an event occurs or circumstances changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
a reporting unit can be an operating segment or a business if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management 
under the impairment test  if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we review long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  including adverse regulatory actions or assessments  and significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
we calculate estimated future undiscounted cash flows  before interest and taxes  resulting from the use of the asset and our estimated value of the asset at disposal and compare it to our carrying value of the asset in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
if a potential impairment exists  a calculation is performed to determine the fair value of the long lived asset 
this calculation is based on a valuation model and discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
third party appraised values may also be used in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
results of operations revenues and cost of revenues in thousands for the years ended december  government contracts cost of government contracts products cost of products services cost of services collaboration agreements 
table of contents government contracts and cost of government contract revenues 
our government contract revenues reflect the ongoing performance of our electrochemical detection  label free and multipathogen detection contracts as well as our microfluidics and influenza genotyping contracts with the dod for the years presented 
changes in the number of contracts underway coupled with changes in the underlying contract activity contributes to the overall increase or decrease in government contracts revenue from year to year 
the changes in contract activity also contribute to the change in government contract costs for the years presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts  completion rates and estimated costs to complete of our government contracts that are ongoing as well as prior contracts that were completed during the years presented 
dod contract activity was essentially flat for the years ended december  and as these contracts near completion  future contract revenues could be volatile in the short term and decrease in the longer term if new government contracts are not awarded or executed 
products and cost of products 
product revenues and costs of products relate to domestic and international sales of our array products  which include dna synthesizer instruments  customarray k  xk  xk and k dna expression arrays  electrasense microarray readers and related hardware 
product revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to due primarily to lower dna synthesizer instrument and microarray reader sales 
as we expand our business focus from exclusively selling array based research and development products to providing array based diagnostic services  we have reduced internal sales staff  marketing and production efforts regarding sales of customarray products and instead are relying more on our product distribution and manufacturing agreements with various third party distributors for sales generation of our suite of customarray products into the research and development markets 
as a result  customarray product revenues will likely be volatile in future periods depending on the sales efforts of our distributors 
product sales from cmdx were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of products includes materials  labor and allocations for manufacturing overhead  as well as non cash stock compensation expense charges  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in product cost of sales was commensurate with the decrease in overall product revenues 
services and cost of services 
services revenues are comprised primarily of diagnostic lab services provided by cmdx as well as the amortization of one year equipment maintenance and service contracts executed with certain customers of our dna synthesizers 
diagnostic services revenues from cmdx were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues have increased due to an increased number of diagnostic test offerings as well as increased customer demand for our suite of diagnostic services provided by cmdx  which is due primarily to increased sales and marketing efforts at cmdx during and cost of services includes materials  labor and allocations for manufacturing overhead  as well as non cash stock compensation expense charges  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of services was commensurate with the increase in overall services revenues 
operating expenses in thousands for the years ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses 
the decrease in internal research and development expenses was due primarily to the impact of cost reduction efforts in the area of full time staff and ongoing research and development projects for the customarray platform  while continuing to develop microarray based 
table of contents diagnostics services at cmdx 
in addition  research and development expenses include  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  of non cash stock compensation expense 
due to one time stock compensation charges incurred during as a result from our split off from acacia  these expenses decreased during future research and development expenses will continue to be incurred in connection with our ongoing internal research and development efforts in the areas of genomics  diagnostics  drug discovery and development 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to fluctuate and such expenses could increase in future periods as additional internal research and development agreements are undertaken and or as new research and development collaborations are executed with strategic partners 
for the years ended december  marketing  general and administrative expenses patent amortization and royalties equity in loss of investee marketing  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in marketing  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to a decrease in legal  accounting and other professional fees  which were higher in due to our split off from acacia 
also  facilities related costs were reduced in as a result of our february lease amendment that significantly reduced our office space and lease rates at our mukilteo  washington location 
partially offsetting these reductions was an increase to sales and marketing costs incurred at cmdx resulting from continued expansion of our sales efforts at this location 
in addition  marketing  general and administrative expenses include non cash stock compensation charges  which were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
despite the inclusion of a one time charge of  incurred during the third quarter of from unvested ar combimatrix stock options that became fully vested on the redemption date as a result of the split off of combimatrix from acacia  marketing  general and administrative related stock compensation expense increased in compared to due to additional stock option awards granted to officers and administrative staff subsequent to the redemption date 
for the years ended december  and  marketing  general and administrative expenses included allocated corporate overhead charges from acacia of zero and  respectively 
we currently lease office and laboratory space of approximately  square feet in mukilteo  washington  under a lease agreement that expires in october we also lease approximately  square feet of office and laboratory facilities in irvine  california  under a lease agreement that expires in january we estimate that our total payments under the operating leases will be  in patent amortization and royalties 
patent amortization of million for the years presented relates to the amortization of our patents recognized from step acquisitions of combimatrix corporation by acacia in and  which are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of approximately years 
for the years ended december  and  royalties expense of  and  respectively  relate to our september settlement agreement with nanogen  inc  and are equal to of payments made to us from sales of certain products to customers that were developed by us based on the patents that had been in dispute in the litigation with nanogen  inc prior to settlement 
equity in loss of investee 
during and  we owned of leuchemix inc or leuchemix  a private drug development firm  which is developing several compounds for the treatment of leukemia and other cancers 
our equity in the losses of leuchemix were flat for the years ended december  compared to  due primarily to consistent operating expenses incurred by leuchemix 

table of contents other non operating items interest income 
interest income decreased due to lower average cash and investment balances coupled with lower market interest rates during compared to interest expense 
since july  we have incurred interest expense charges from a million secured convertible debenture  which accrues interest at an annual rate of 
interest expense also includes amortization of the million of debt discount recognized from issuance of the secured convertible debenture and warrants  using the effective interest method 
derivative gains 
for the year ended december   derivative gains totaling  represent the net benefit recognized from mark to market adjustments to the embedded derivatives of the secured convertible debenture 
prior to the redemption  the outstanding ar combimatrix stock purchase warrants were classified as long term liabilities due to certain redemption provisions associated with the underlying ar combimatrix stock 
changes in the fair value of the stock purchase warrant liabilities are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  which resulted in non cash benefits of million for on the redemption date  all outstanding warrants to purchase ar combimatrix common stock became exercisable in combimatrix common stock  which is not subject to the redemption provisions that required liability classification of the warrants prior to the redemption date 
in accordance with eitf and related guidance  the fair value of the warrants as of the close of trading on august  the last day that the warrants were exercisable in ar combimatrix common stock of million was classified to additional paid in capital 
we do not expect to incur additional warrant gains or charges in the future for our existing common stock purchase warrants 
however  the issuance of warrants in future equity financings  should they occur  may be required to be classified as long term liabilities subject to fair value adjustments 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact in the current or prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash  cash equivalents and available for sale short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  working capital increased as of december  primarily due to overall increases in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investment balances compared to december  cash balances increased during due primarily to financing transactions discussed below that were executed in the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december  and was comprised of the following in thousands for the years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities 
the decrease in net cash used in operations was due primarily to an increase in cash receipts from customers  which totaled million in compared to million in the primary reason for the increase in cash receipts from customers was due to increased cash receipts from customarray and diagnostics customers  which totaled million in compared to million in cash collections from our government contract billings were million in compared to million in total cash outflows were million in both and investing activities 
the change in net cash flows from investing activities for all years presented was due primarily to our ongoing short term cash management activities and changes in short term investments in connection with certain financing activities discussed below 
fixed asset purchases were  and  in and  respectively 
financing activities 
the increase in net cash flows from financing activities was due primarily to the sale of a million secured convertible debenture in july for million net of issuance costs  credit line borrowings of  in may and proceeds of  from the exercise of common stock warrants and options during  versus the completion of a registered direct offering of ar combimatrix common stock in may for million as well as the exercise of ar combimatrix common stock warrants totaling  during financing activities during and were as follows on july   we issued to ya global investments  lp ya i a secured convertible debenture the debenture with an aggregate principal amount of million  which is convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of per share  and ii warrants the warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
the debenture is due on the earlier of july  the term or within four months after our receipt of payment of settlement or judgment proceeds from national union in accordance with the judgment issued by the federal court earlier in the debenture bears interest at an annual rate of  with interest payments due quarterly in either cash or our common stock  beginning october we have the right to force conversion of the debenture into our common stock if the volume weighted average price or vwap of our stock exceeds between and of the fixed conversion price for a period of thirty consecutive trading days  among other conditions and restrictions 
we also have a cash redemption option whereby we have the right to pre pay the debenture during the term  but only if our common stock is trading below the fixed conversion price  among other conditions 
prepayment penalties range between and of the principal amount due  depending when the cash redemption occurs during the term 
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the debenture may increase due to certain anti dilution adjustments  including if we were to issue common stock at a price lower than the fixed conversion price while the outstanding principal amount of the debenture is at least million  or if we had failed to generate at least million in gross revenues for our fiscal year ended december  based on our annual revenues for the year ended december  of million  this contingency has expired 
the debenture is secured by the judgment as well as our intellectual property 
the warrants have a five year term and allow ya to purchase i  shares of common stock at an exercise price of  and ii  shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
we have the right to call the warrants  but only if the vwap of our common stock is at or greater than of the warrants exercise price for at least twenty consecutive trading days  among other conditions 
during the third quarter of  we registered  shares of our common stock that are issuable to ya upon conversion of the debenture and exercise of the warrants on form s with the sec 
as of december   ya had converted million of the debenture into common stock 
on may  and pursuant to a loan management account agreement the lma with a financial institution the lender  we borrowed  from the lender  secured by cash and investments held in an investment account with the lender 
the lma is similar to a revolving line 
table of contents of credit borrowing facility 
the lma provides that we accrue monthly interest charges at an annual  variable rate of plus the day libor resulting in a rate of approximately at december  
the total amount available under the lma ranges from to of investments pledged as collateral  based upon the amount and security type in our investment portfolio  up to a maximum amount of million 
the lma has no stated maturity for the principal and interest amounts borrowed by us 
however  the lender does have the ability under the terms of the lma to call in the principal amount of the borrowings at any time 
on may   acacia executed a registered direct offering with certain directors of combimatrix corporation and other unaffiliated investors raising gross proceeds of million through the issuance of  units 
each unit consisted of one share of ar combimatrix common stock and a five year common stock warrant  for a total of  shares and warrants to purchase  shares of ar combimatrix common stock issued to investors 
each warrant entitled the holder to purchase a share of ar combimatrix stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from the may registered direct offering were attributed to us by acacia 
future liquidity 
we have a history of incurring net losses and net operating cash flow deficits 
we are also deploying new and unproven technologies and continue to develop commercial products 
we have several ongoing long term development projects that involve experimental technology and may require several years and substantial expenditures to complete 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and other external sources of available credit will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to september in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond september  we will be required to obtain capital from external sources 
however  there can be no assurances that additional sources of financing  including the issuance of debt and or equity securities will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of equity securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs including research projects and personnel  which could jeopardize the future strategic initiatives and business plans of the company 
for example  reductions in research and development activities and or personnel at our mukilteo  washington facility could result in the inability to invest the resources necessary to continue to develop next generation products and improve existing product lines in order to remain competitive in the marketplace  resulting in reduced revenues and cash flows from the sales of our customarray products and services 
also  reduction in operating costs at cmdx  should they occur  could jeopardize its ability to launch  market and sell additional diagnostics products and services necessary to grow and sustain its operations to eventually achieve profitability 
the anticipation that we will be required to obtain additional financing in the foreseeable future raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond september in addition to seeking additional capital from outside sources  our plans in regard to these matters include reductions in overhead costs as well as research and development costs that are not considered strategically vital to our business 
also  we are focusing our sales and product development efforts on our core diagnostic array platform as well as our funded research and development projects for the dod 
auction rate securities 
at december  and  our available for sale investments included million and million  respectively  of auction rate securities ars at par value 
historically  the carrying value of our ars approximated fair value due to active  liquid markets for these securities as well as the frequent resetting of the interest rates at auction  which typically occurred every to days 
however  in mid february  the market for ars collapsed and as a result  our ars experienced multiple failed auctions during prior to mid february  we sold million of our ars at par value 
of the remaining million held in ars   were issued by a state student loan lending organization  carried an a a rating and were insured by the federal family education loan program 
the remaining  of ars were aaa rated auction market preferred stock amps issued by publicly traded mutual funds that are required to maintain at least of asset coverage for issued ars

on january   all of our remaining ars were liquidated at par value 
from mid february through the third quarter of  the fair values of our holdings in ars were estimated using discounted cash flow models 
these models consider  among other things  the timing of expected future successful auctions  estimated future cash flows  collateralization and credit worthiness of underlying security investments and discount rates applied to the estimated future cash flows 
since these inputs were not observable  they were classified as level inputs under sfas as a result of the lack of liquidity in the ars market and not as a result of the quality of the underlying collateral  we recorded unrealized losses on our ars of  through the period ended september  however  due to liquidations of our ars at par value prior to and subsequent to december   we reversed our previously recognized unrealized losses of  and classified our ars as current assets at par value in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
capital requirements 
we may also encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated 
any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through equity  debt or other external financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our long term capital requirements will be substantial and the adequacy of available funds will depend upon many factors  including the costs of commercialization activities  including sales and marketing  manufacturing and capital equipment  our continued progress in research and development programs  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending any patents claims  should they arise  the costs involved in defending our judgment against the appeal brought by national union  our ability to license technology  competing technological developments  the creation and formation of strategic partnerships  the costs associated with leasing and improving our irvine  california facility  and other factors that may not be within our control

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities issued by the us treasury as well as ars 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments in a variety of investment grade securities and with a variety of issuers  including government securities  ars and money market funds
