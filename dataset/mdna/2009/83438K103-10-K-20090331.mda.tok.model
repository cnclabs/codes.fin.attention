overview we design  develop  manufacture and market aesthetic energy devices to address aging skin 
we were incorporated in and received fda clearance for treatment of periorbital wrinkles and commercially launched our first thermage system in in june  we received fda clearance for the treatment of facial wrinkles and rhytids 
in december  we received fda clearance to market our system for the treatment of wrinkles and rhytids  without limitation to particular areas of the body 
in october  we received fda clearance to market our system for the temporary improvement in the appearance of cellulite 
in june  we received clearance to market our system for treatment of wrinkles and rhytids for the upper and lower eyelids 
our patented and fda cleared system uses radiofrequency  or rf  energy to heat and shrink collagen and tighten tissue while simultaneously cooling and protecting the surface of the skin 
as of december   we had an installed base of approximately  thermage systems and had sold over  treatment tips 
on december   as described below  we acquired reliant technologies  inc reliant  a privately held company  for million in cash  million shares of our common stock and assumption of million of debt  including a million note payable to thermage 
the acquisition combined two companies with strong brand names with one of the largest direct us sales forces in the industry 
our results of operations in the year ended december  included the effect of the acquisition of reliant on december  and the results of operations of reliant from december  to december  following the acquisition  we changed our name to solta medical  inc during the second half of  our business was impacted by the weakness in global economic conditions and tightening of the credit markets  which resulted in a slowdown in customer purchase decisions 
as our procedures are generally elective  the slowing economy reduced demand for our procedures 
the tight credit markets limited the ability of some of our customers to obtain financing for the purchase of our products 
consequently  net revenue for the year decreased  or million  to million  from million in we believe with the acquisition of reliant  we are better positioned to maximize our opportunities in the marketplace and have begun to implement a number of initiatives in response to the tight worldwide credit market  including expanding our partner program to include new customer rental programs for both thermage and fraxel systems and expanding the partner plan to include fraxel consumables  as well as offering incentives to doctors who become both fraxel and thermage customers 

table of contents acquisition of reliant technologies  inc on december   we acquired of the common stock of reliant for million in cash and million shares of solta medical common stock and assumption of million of debt  including a million note payable to thermage 
this acquisition expands the market presence of the company 
complementary product offerings allow us to cross sell a more complete product line to physician and their patients through one of the largest direct us sales forces in the industry and an expansive international distribution network 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  the acquisition purchase price totaled a combined million cash paid  million for million shares issued at the share price on the date of announcement   fair value of assumed warrants and approximately million in direct transaction costs 
we have recorded an estimate for costs to terminate some activities associated with the reliant operations in accordance with the guidance of emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
the restructuring accrual of approximately million is principally related to the termination of reliant employees of approximately million and restructuring of facilities of million 
the valuation of identified intangible assets acquired was based on management s estimates  currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions 
the allocation was generally based on the fair value of these assets determined using the income and market approaches 
of the total purchase price of approximately million  approximately million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets 
approximately million of the amortizable intangible assets are being amortized using a straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives of two to years 
in conjunction with the acquisition of reliant  we recorded an expense of approximately for acquired in process research and development ipr d during the year ended december   because feasibility of the acquired technology had not been established and no alternative future use exists 
the ipr d is related to the development of three new products 
we determined the value of acquired ipr d using the discounted cash flow approach 
we calculated the present value of the expected future cash flows attributable to the in process technology using a to discount rate 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these ipr d projects include delays caused by legal actions brought by the company s competitors and the timing of the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals 
no assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur 
for these and other reasons  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results 
we allocated the residual value of approximately million to goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
significant business trends we derive revenue primarily from the sale of systems  treatment tips and consumables 
for the years ended december   and we derived  and  respectively  of our revenue from treatment tips and consumable sales  and  and  respectively  of our revenue from systems sales 
the balance of our revenue is derived from product service and shipping 
during  we launched four new procedures and associated treatment tips  including the premium stc tip for skin tightening and contouring  and the dc tip for deep contouring and body shaping 
in march  we introduced the cellulite tip 
as a result of the introduction of new treatment tips in and  we have seen a gradual increase in the average selling price of our treatment tips 

table of contents we market our products in the united states to physicians  including primarily dermatologists and plastic surgeons  through a direct sales force and internationally in countries through a network of independent distributors 
in each of the years ended december   and  we derived of our revenue from sales of our products and services within the united states and of our revenue from sales of our products and services outside the united states 
we believe that a significant portion of our business will continue to come from international sales through increased penetration in countries where we currently sell our products  combined with expansion into new international markets 
the percentages of our revenue by region are presented in the below table years ended december  united states asia pacific europe middle east rest of the world total net revenue reliant offered three fraxel laser systems and revenue derived from sales of such systems represented and of reliant s total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue from treatment tips and consumables represented and  respectively  of total revenue for the years ended december  and approximately of reliant s revenue was derived from sales of products and services within the united states for and and of their revenue from sales of products and services outside the united states 
with the acquisition of reliant  we expect sales of treatment tips and consumables to decrease as percentage of solta revenue versus system sales 
we also expect revenue derived from sales of products and services within the united states to increase as a percentage of total solta revenue 
we continue to believe our bifurcated sales force will serve us well 
with the acquisition of reliant  we have one of the largest direct us sales forces in the industry  with about half of the sales force focusing on existing customers on sales of treatment tips  upgrades and training  and the remainder focusing on securing new accounts 
future operating results are difficult to predict accurately 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including prevailing economic conditions and our customers access to the credit market  the timing of introduction and the degree of acceptance of future product offerings  unanticipated interruptions and expenses related to our manufacturing operations  and the performance of our direct sales force and international distributors 
significant industry factors the growth of our business relies on current economic conditions and their impact on the growth of the industry  our ability to continue to develop new products  applications and innovative technologies  obtain and maintain regulatory clearances for our products  protect our proprietary technology and successfully market and distribute our products 
our industry is characterized by seasonally lower demand during the third calendar quarter of the year  when both physicians and prospective patients take summer vacations 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success depends on our ability to compete successfully 
our business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including political and economic conditions such as recessionary environments  the levels of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
declines in consumer spending on aesthetic procedures could also have an adverse effect on our operating results 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that impact our business is provided in the risk factors section in this annual report on form k 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and warranty reserve 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
product revenue is recognized when title and risk of ownership have been transferred  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  remaining obligations are insignificant and collectibility is reasonably assured 
transfer of title and risk of ownership occur when the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of customer and distributor discounts 
revenue from the sale of extended service contracts for products beyond their warranty term is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable extended contract 
we also earn service revenue from customers outside of their warranty term or extended service contracts 
such service revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
our system sales in the united states typically have post sale obligations of installation and training 
these obligations are fulfilled after product shipment  and in these cases  we recognize revenue in accordance with the multiple element accounting guidance set forth in emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
when we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  we defer revenue attributable to the post shipment obligations and recognize such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled 
otherwise  we will defer all revenue until all elements are delivered 
since the introduction of our new thermage nxt system in february  we continued to sell our thermage tc generator to customers in countries where we have not yet obtained approval on the new generator 
in accordance with eitf  we have deferred the fair value of the customer s right to upgrade to the thermage nxt system until the earlier of final delivery or expiration of such rights 
we sell to end users in the united states and primarily to distributors outside of the united states 
sales to distributors do not include return rights 
we typically recognize revenues upon shipment for sales to our independent third party distributors as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment  other than replacement parts warranty coverage 
the distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  installation  training and warranty services for our products 
we do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributors to return or exchange products and the distributors are obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of whether the distributors are able to resell the product 
for sales transactions with non standard extended payment terms or when collectibility is not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash payment 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable investments we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents 
we account for our marketable investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
marketable investments are carried at fair value and consist of corporate debt securities and certificates of deposits which are accounted for as available for sale securities held for use in current operations and are 
table of contents classified in current assets as marketable investments 
available for sale securities with maturities greater than twelve months are classified as short term as they represent investments for cash that are available for use in current operations 
realized gains and losses on marketable investments are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method 
unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable investments classified as available for sale are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of related tax effects  unless the unrealized holding losses are deemed to be other than temporary  in which case they are included in earnings 
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion is included in interest income 
determining whether the decline in fair value of our marketable investments is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in debt securities  these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer  the issuer s credit rating  and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt securities will not mature and be paid in full  and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be wrong  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations 
in addition  if management decides not to hold an investment until maturity  it may result in the recognition of an other than temporary impairment 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenues earned from customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate appropriate allowances based upon any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
our assessment of the ability of our customers to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  a review of their financial status  as well as consideration of their payment history with us 
allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
doubtful account write offs were   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
warranty reserve we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
our estimated warranty liability was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we offered a three year warranty for thermage systems sold in the united states  one year for fraxel systems sold worldwide and a one year replacement parts warranty for systems sold to distributors outside of the united states through december  beginning in january   we will offer a one year warranty period for systems sold worldwide 
we also provide a warranty for our consumable products 
inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value  cost being determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market value being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored on a monthly basis and updated quarterly and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of revenue and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic 
table of contents inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins 
our inventory reserves as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  our goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step the fair value of the company is compared to the carrying value including goodwill 
if the carrying value including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the company  step is performed 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step an allocation is performed of the fair value of our identifiable tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and liabilities 
this is used to derive an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment change would be recognized for the excess 
we did not have any goodwill prior to the acquisition of reliant 
we acquired reliant on december  and recorded goodwill of approximately million 
we did not perform a test for goodwill impairment in as there were no underlying events and circumstances relative to the business which would support an immediate impairment of the acquired goodwill from the december  acquisition date to december  while there were no new events occurring in the short period between the acquisition date and december  that impacted our valuation of goodwill  we considered the fact that the publicly traded value of our company was less than the carrying value  including goodwill  at december  we concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed at december  based upon factors including our decision to proceed with the closing of the acquisition after the acquisition plan was announced  the short period of time elapsing since the acquisition date  the implied premium over the quoted market price of our stock resulting from recent third party acquisition proposals made for our company in prior to the acquisition of reliant  the business reasons for executing the merger and the benefits that are expected to result  and our expectations of the future operating and financial performance of our business 
we will continue to monitor for any indicators that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the occurrence of adverse events or circumstances  including changes in our expectations of the future financial performance of our business  may result in us recording a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives ranging from two to twelve years 
if the acquired intangible asset is not currently generating revenue  amortization is deferred until the acquired intangible asset begins to generate revenue 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets  including property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
under sfas no 
 an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its 
table of contents eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
through december   there have been no such impairments 
litigation and claims we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters and claims  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas no 
 and related pronouncements 
also  in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not record gain contingencies 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses and gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax bases of an asset or a liability and its reported amount on the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and unless we believe that recovery is more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance  lack of taxable income and our accumulated deficit  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at december  and if we are able to demonstrate consistent profitability in the future  and we are able to establish that recovery is more likely than not  we would reduce the valuation allowance at a future date 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  these carryforwards will begin to expire in for federal and in for state income tax purposes 
as of december   we had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in the california tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
the internal revenue code section limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
in such an event  utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted 
stock based compensation expense we apply the fair value provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method  which requires that for nonpublic 
table of contents entities that used the minimum value method for either pro forma or financial statement recognition purposes  sfas no 
r shall be applied to option awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date 
for options granted prior to the sfas no

for options accounted for under apb no 
that were granted prior to january  and then modified after january   we will apply sfas no 
r to these option grants upon the date of modification 
all option grants valued after january  will be expensed on a straight line basis 
under sfas no 
r  we calculated the fair value of the stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based award and the stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
for the year ended december   the fair value was based on the following weighted average assumptions expected term of years  expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of and dividend yield of

the expected term has been computed based upon the vesting term  cancellation history  historical exercises and contractual term of the options 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
the aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding options vested and expected to vest at december  was  based upon the fair market value of common stock at december  of per share 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
equity instruments issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest 
non employee stock based compensation charges are amortized over the vesting period  on a straight line basis

we expect to increase capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in manufacturing  infrastructure and personnel 
we also may increase our capital expenditures as we expand our product lines or invest to address new markets

our future liquidity requirements may increase beyond currently expected levels if we fail to maintain compliance with such covenants or if we fail to achieve cost savings and synergies from the reliant acquisition or if unanticipated expenses or other uses of our cash arise 
in order to meet our future liquidity needs  we may become reliant on additional equity and or debt financing 
such additional financing may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  or at all  particularly in the short term due to the current credit and equity market funding environments 
the availability of financing or merger opportunities will depend  in part  on market conditions  and the outlook for our company 
any future equity financing would result in substantial dilution to our stockholders

fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas 
this fsp clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
in particular  it provides additional guidance on a how the reporting entity s own assumptions that is  expected cash flows and appropriately risk adjusted discount rates should be considered when measuring fair value when relevant observable inputs do not exist  b how available observable inputs in a market that is not active should be considered when measuring fair value  and c how the use of market quotes for example  broker quotes or pricing services for the same or similar financial assets should be considered when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable inputs available to measure fair value 
this fsp is effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
the adoption of the fsp did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to credit and interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio primarily includes fixed rate debt instruments of corporate issuers  fixed rate euro bonds and certificates of deposit 
a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of our investments to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing rate rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of december  would have potentially declined by  to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at a weighted average maturity of generally one year or less 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
during the second half of the year  a security in our investment portfolio suffered a substantial loss in fair market value 
we determined that such loss in fair market value was other than temporary  and as a result  we recorded approximately million other than temporary impairment loss on investments in the quarter ended september  and a further loss of million in the quarter ended december  of the million loss recorded during the year  approximately million was related to the aforementioned security 
the current extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets expose us to investment risks  including the risks that the value and liquidity of our investments could further deteriorate and the issuers of the securities we hold could be subject to credit rating downgrades 
there is no assurance that our investment portfolio will not suffer further losses in the future 
although currently most of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies
