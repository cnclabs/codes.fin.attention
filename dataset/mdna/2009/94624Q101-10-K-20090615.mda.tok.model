item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the consolidated financial statements include wayne savings bancshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  wayne savings community bank 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities and investment portfolios  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net income also is affected by its provision for losses on loans  as well as the amount of noninterest income  including trust fees and service charges  and noninterest expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  deposit insurance premiums  occupancy and equipment costs  and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
business strategy the company s current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized  profitable and community oriented bank dedicated to providing quality service and products to its customers 
the company has sought to implement this strategy in recent years by closely monitoring the needs of customers and providing personal  quality customer service  continuing the origination of a wide array of loan products in the company s market area  managing interest rate risk exposure by better matching asset and liability maturities and rates  increasing fee income  including the continuing growth of the trust department  managing asset quality  maintaining a strong retail deposit base  maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  and emphasizing the commercial loan program to add high quality  higher yielding assets to the company s loan portfolio 
discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
economic circumstances  the company s operations  and actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and the company s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include  but are not limited to  those with respect to the following matters management s determination of the amount and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the effect of changes in interest rates  management s opinion as to the effects of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements  and management s opinion as to the bank s ability to maintain regulatory capital at current levels 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses and related loss provision to be a critical accounting policy 
a detailed discussion as to the application of such policy is set forth on the following pages 
at march   total assets increased incrementally to million from the million total at march  mainly due to an increase in loans of million offset by a decrease of million in federal funds sold 
liquid assets  consisting of cash  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits  decreased by million  or  to million at march   mainly due to a reduction in federal funds sold 
during the fiscal year ended march   loans receivable increased million  or  as the bank originated and retained million of loans and received payments of million 
rather than reinvest funds from repayments on loans in long term  fixed rate and lower yielding residential loans  the lending division has been able to originate non residential real estate loans 
the company believes that investing in shorter term adjustable rate commercial loans positions the company favorably in the current interest rate environment 
the loan portfolio continued to increase during the fiscal year ending march   as exemplified by an increase in nonresidential real estate loans of million and an increase in commercial loans of million  slightly reduced by a consumer loan decrease of million and a decrease in one to four family residential loans of  at march  and  the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of loans and million or of loans  respectively 
in determining the amount of the loan loss allowance at any point of time  management and the board systematically determine the risk of loss in the portfolio 
first  delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans are evaluated for potential impairment in carrying value 
at march   all delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans were analyzed  with  of the reserve being allocated to these categories of loans 
the largest commercial real estate loan totaled million  located in wadsworth  ohio  for which the company obtained an appraisal of million during the quarter ended march  the second commercial real estate loan was transferred into foreclosed assets held for sale in the quarter ended june  the company had four commercial loans totaling  that were identified as impaired 
in addition  the company had two non residential real estate loans totaling  of which one loan was restructured for interest only payments and the second loan was days past due 
the second step in determining the allowance for loan losses entails the application of historic loss experience to individual loan types in the portfolio 
in addition to the historic loss percentage  management employs an additional risk percentage tailored to the board s and management s perception of the overall risk in the economy 
finally  to provide additional assurance regarding the validity of the commercial loan risk rating system  management engages a third party loan reviewer who provides independent validation of the bank s loan grading process 
management recorded a million provision for losses on loans for fiscal  an increase of  over the  recorded for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to the increase in non performing loans  increased charge offs and growth in the portfolio 
in addition  the fas analysis for potential impairment indicated the need for allocations within the reserve as discussed above 
in addition to the fas analysis performed on loans as discussed above  management evaluated the company s holding of stock in the federal home loan bank of cincinnati and the company s goodwill 
media reports during january suggested a risk of impairment in federal home loan bank stock 
the company s subsidiary  wayne savings community bank  holds million of stock in the federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb as part of its membership and to support advance activity as required by the fhlb 
management has reviewed the rating agency report underlying the media reports  and along with regular review of the fhlb of cincinnati s filings with the sec  has concluded that the investment is not impaired at this time 
goodwill of million is carried on the company s balance sheet as a result of the acquisition of stebbins bancshares in june in accordance with fas  this goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the date used by management up to and including the current fiscal year was december given the significant discount in the company s stock price compared to book and tangible book values  an evaluation was done as of march  management evaluated the goodwill using an analysis of required measures of value  including the current stock price as an indicator of minority interest value  change of control multiples as a measure of controlling interest value and discounted cash flow analysis as a measure of going concern value and applied a weighting based on appraisal standards to arrive at a valuation conclusion that indicated no impairment at this time 
management elected to change the evaluation date to the annual financial statement date of march to produce a more accurate assessment as of the financial statement date 
deposits totaled million at march   a decrease of million  or  from million at march  certificates of deposit decreased by million  or  and money market deposits decreased million  or 
these decreases were offset by an increase in savings accounts of million  or  and an increase in checking accounts of million  or 
the company experienced an increase in low cost liquid deposit accounts as management exercised discipline during the period with regard to the pricing of retail certificates 
in general  management attempts to benchmark retail certificate of deposit pricing to the cost of alternate sources of funds  including federal home loan bank advances and brokered deposits 
exceptions are made to defend customer relationships with significant value to the bank while allowing rate sensitive certificate of deposit shoppers to move to other alternatives 
the local deposit market has been negatively affected by national and online competitors offering higher rates to address liquidity concerns in national markets 
other short term borrowings increased by million as a result of the increase in commercial repurchase agreements growth 
additional federal home loan advances of million maturing in fiscal  and were borrowed to offset the runoff in deposits due to management s strategic pricing strategy 
stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of  or  during the year ending march   due primarily to million in net income for the fiscal year ended march  and an increase of  in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the unrealized gains on available for sale securities during fiscal and amortization of the esop shares of  these increases were offset by dividends totaling million  a  reduction due to the adoption of the eitf issue  which required the company to record a liability for postretirement cost of split dollar life insurance agreements related to the bank owned life insurance program  a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income arising from the fas pension adjustment of  and purchases of treasury stock totaling  for the fiscal year ended march  comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and general net income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of  when compared to net income for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in the provision for loan losses of  coupled with an increase in total noninterest expense of  or and a decrease in total noninterest income of  or 
these decreases in net income were partially offset by an increase in net interest income of  or  and reduced income tax expense of  or 
interest income interest income decreased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets to from for the fiscal year ended march   offset by an increase in the average balance of million  or 
the yield decrease is primarily due to the federal reserve lowering the federal funds rate basis points over the past year 
these rate decreases have negatively affected the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets and the most immediate decrease is reflected in the yield on interest bearing deposits 
interest income on loans decreased million  or  for the year ended march   compared to fiscal  due primarily to a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on loans outstanding  offset by a million  or  increase in the average balance of loans year over year 
the decrease in the yield was due to the decrease in market interest rates and the corresponding downward impact on new originations 
the increase in the average balance of loans was primarily due to the emphasis on the origination of nonresidential and commercial loans 
interest income on securities decreased  or  during fiscal  compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decrease of million  or  in the average balance  caused mainly by continued principal prepayments and maturities of million  which exceeded purchases of million  offset by an increase of five basis points in the weighted average yield to as compared to  from the comparable period  generally reflecting reinvestment in higher yielding mortgage backed securities as the lower yielding agency bonds matured 
despite the federal reserve s action of lowering the federal funds rate by basis points over the fiscal year  management was able to increase the average interest yield on investment securities 
interest income on interest earning deposits decreased by  or  for the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average yield of basis points to  coupled with a decrease in the average balance during fiscal of  or 
as discussed above  the decrease in the yield was primarily due to the actions of the federal reserve in lowering the federal funds rate basis points over the past year 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from interest expense for fiscal year ended march  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the weighted average cost of funds of basis points to for fiscal  offset by an increase of million  or  in the average balance of deposits and borrowings outstanding in fiscal interest expense on deposits totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease in deposit costs resulted from a decrease of basis points in the weighted average cost of deposits to for fiscal  coupled with a decrease in the average balance outstanding of million  or 
in addition  as noted earlier  a shift in the composition of deposits from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost checking and savings accounts contributed to the decrease in the cost of deposits  along with the actions of the federal reserve in lowering the federal funds rate during the year 
interest expense on other short term borrowings totaled  for the year ended march   a decrease of  or  from the period  due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average rate of basis points to for the fiscal year ended march the rate decrease was the result of the federal reserve lowering the federal funds rate basis points over the past year as this product is linked to this rate 
interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended march   an increase of  or  from the period  due primarily to an increase in the average balance of million  or  offset with a decrease in the weighted average rate of basis points to for the fiscal year ended march  as a result of lower rate advances 
the increase in the average balance was due to increased borrowings to offset the runoff in deposits due to management s strategic pricing strategy that focused on the maintenance of customer relationships while avoiding high cost retail deposits 
net interest income net interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of  or  from the amount for fiscal the average interest rate spread increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the net interest margin increased to for fiscal from for the fiscal year ended march  these ratios increased as the decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets of basis points was more than offset by the decrease in the cost of funds of basis points 
as noted earlier  a shift in the composition of deposits from higher cost certificates of deposit and money market investor deposits to the lower cost checking and savings accounts contributed to the decrease in the cost of deposits 
provision for losses on loans the company recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling million and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
at march   all delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans were analyzed  resulting in a reserve allocation of  the increase in the provision expense also reflects an increase in the levels of delinquent loans and management s analysis of economic conditions in the bank s market areas 
in the opinion of management  as of march   the carrying value of all non performing loans as of march  is expected to be realized 
noninterest income noninterest income  consisting primarily of earnings on bank owned life insurance policies  gains on sale of loans  trust income and service fees  and charges on deposit accounts decreased by  or  to million for fiscal  from million for the year ended march  the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in service fees and charges on deposit accounts of  or  mainly due to a volume decrease in fiscal  partially offset by an increase of  in gain on sale of loans 
as described under item above  management engages in limited sales of newly originated loans to limit the buildup of interest rate risk on the balance sheet and to provide liquidity to accommodate additional refinancing activity 
trust income and earnings on bank owned life insurance were down by  and  respectively  as the market yields were down year to year 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased by  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal the increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase of  in loss on disposal and impairment provision of real estate acquired through foreclosure 
management evaluated two foreclosed assets held for sale and charged a provision of  in fiscal  the bank recognized a  gain on disposal of real estate acquired through foreclosure 
federal deposit insurance increased  as the one time credit given to the bank in fiscal has now been fully used along with an increase in deposit insurance premium rates 
franchise tax expense increased by  or  mainly due to a reduction of a receivable from an amendment of prior returns 
occupancy and equipment expense increased  or  as a result of increased leasehold expenditures 
salaries and employee benefits increased by  from fiscal to fiscal as the bank reduced staff  eliminated emeritus director fees and nominally was able to reduce benefit costs 
a decrease of  or  in other operating expense was primarily attributable to decreased advertising and public relations costs of  with reduced internal audit expenses of  and decreased internet banking costs of  as the bank renegotiated the online banking contract 
federal income taxes federal income tax expense was  for the year ended march   reflecting a decrease of  from fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from a  decrease in pre tax income 
the difference in the effective tax rate from the statutory rate was mainly due to the beneficial effects of income from the cash surrender value of life insurance and other tax exempt obligations 
average balance sheet the following tables set forth certain information relating to the company s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated

while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank manages the pricing of deposits to maintain a desired level of deposits and cost of funds 
in addition  the bank invests excess funds in federal funds and other short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
federal funds sold and other liquid assets outstanding at march  and  amounted to million and million  respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from the company s operating  financing and investing activities  see the statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a major portion of the bank s liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of operating  investing and financing activities 
the primary sources of cash are net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from deposits and advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb  and sales of securities 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate funds internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank  which provide an additional source of funds 
at march   the company had million in outstanding advances from the fhlb 
at march   management believes the company has additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb totaling million based on the bank s one to four family residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  home equity lines of credit  second mortgage loans and multifamily loans 
the bank also has pledged million to secure a line of credit with the federal reserve bank of million 
the bank has the ability to pledge remaining investments and mortgage backed securities of million which would allow the bank the ability to borrow additional funds from the fhlb 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at march  payments due by period less more than than year years years years total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations advances from the federal home loan bank other short term borrowings certificates of deposit maturities amount of commitments expiring per period commitments to originate loans letters of credit credit card overdraft lines of credit home equity commercial lines of credit one to four family and multi family loans total contractual obligations impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that interest earning assets reprice at a different time than interest bearing liabilities 
as part of its effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  the bank uses the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the ots as part of its interest rate sensitivity regulations 
the application of npv methodology illustrates certain aspects of the bank s interest rate risk 
generally  npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the npv  which would result from a theoretical change in market interest rates 
asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis continued presented below  as of march  and  is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained  and basis point basis point equals 
increases and a and basis point decrease in market interest rates 
due to the current interest rate environment  the changes in npv are not estimated for a decrease of basis points 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp  bp  as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp   bp  the company s policy in recent years had been to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and by originating adjustable rate mortgage arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investments and mortgage backed securities 
however  particularly in the current interest rate and credit market environment  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
accordingly  arm loan originations were very limited during the fiscal year ended march  the net effect of this continuing shift in customer preference for longer duration loans and shorter duration deposits has been to expose the company to increased interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability management committee alco  which is responsible for reviewing the company s asset liability policies 
the committee meets and reports monthly to the board of directors on interest rate risks and trends  as well as liquidity and capital ratios and requirements 
the bank has operated within the framework of its prescribed asset liability risk ranges for each of the last three years
