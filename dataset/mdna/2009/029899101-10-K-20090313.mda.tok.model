competition the businesses of gswc and ccwc are substantially free from direct and indirect competition with other public utilities  municipalities and other public agencies within their existing service territories 
gswc and ccwc compete with governmental agencies and other investor owned utilities in connection with offering service to new real estate developments on the basis of financial terms  availability of water and ability to commence providing service on a timely basis 
awr s other subsidiary  asus  actively competes for business with other investor owned utilities  other third party providers of water and or wastewater services  and governmental entities on the basis of price and quality of service 
employee relations gswc had employees as of december  as compared to at december  eighteen positions in gswc s bear valley electric customer service area are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers  which expires in sixty eight positions in gswc s region ii ratemaking district are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the utility workers union of america  which expires in gswc has no other unionized employees

table of contents forward looking information this form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements regarding our goals  beliefs  plans or current expectations  taking into account the information currently available to management 
forward looking statements are not statements of historical facts 
for example  when we use words such as believes  anticipates  expects  plans  estimates  intends  may and other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcome  we are making forward looking statements 
such statements address future events and conditions concerning such matters as our ability to raise capital  capital expenditures  earnings  litigation  rates  water sales  water quality and other regulatory matters  adequacy of water supplies  our ability to recover electric  natural gas and water supply costs from ratepayers  contract operations  liquidity and capital resources  and accounting matters 
we caution you that any forward looking statements made by us are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated in such statements  by reason of factors such as changes in utility regulation  recovery of regulatory assets not yet included in rates  future economic conditions which affect changes in customer demand and changes in water and energy supply costs  repayment of amounts owed to us and changes in pension and postretirement benefit plan costs  future climatic conditions  delays in customer payments or price redeterminations or equitable adjustments on contracts executed by asus and its subsidiaries  potential assessments for failure to meet interim targets for the purchase of renewable energy  and legislative  legal proceedings  regulatory and other circumstances affecting anticipated revenues and costs 

table of contents item a risk factors you should carefully read the risks described below and other information in this form k in order to understand certain of the risks of our business 
our business is heavily regulated and  as a result  decisions by regulatory agencies and changes in laws and regulations can significantly affect our business our revenues depend substantially on the rates and fees we charge our customers and the ability to recover our costs on a timely basis  including the ability to recover the costs of purchased water  groundwater assessments  electric power  natural gas  chemicals  water treatment  security at water facilities and preventative maintenance and emergency repairs 
any delays by either the cpuc or the acc in granting rate relief to cover increased operating and capital costs at our public utilities or delays in obtaining approval of our requests for equitable adjustments or price redetermination for contracted services from the us government may adversely affect our financial performance 
we may file for interim rates in california in situations where there may be delays in granting final rate relief during a general rate case proceeding 
if the cpuc approves lower rates  the cpuc will require us to refund to customers the difference between the interim rates and the rates approved by the cpuc 
regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings  affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses  may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses and could result in impairment of goodwill if the decision affects ccwc or asus 
management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  liabilities and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and or reserves as deemed necessary 
in the event that our assessment of the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect  we will adjust the associated regulatory asset or liability to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances 
management also reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually 
a change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets  a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our costs or material impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we determined that ccwc s goodwill had been impaired by million as of december  due  in part  to regulatory lags and adverse regulatory decisions by the acc 
ccwc has million of goodwill remaining which may be at risk for potential impairment if rate increases that we have requested from the acc are not granted 
asus also has million of goodwill which may be at risk for potential impairment if requested price redeterminations and equitable adjustments are not granted 
we are also  in some cases  required to estimate future expenses and in others  we are required to incur the expense before recovering costs 
as a result  our revenues and earnings may fluctuate depending on the accuracy of our estimates  timing of our investments or expenses or other factors 
if expenses increase significantly over a short period of time  we may experience delays in recovery of these expenses  the inability to recover carrying costs for these expenses and increased risks of regulatory disallowances or write offs 
regulatory agencies may also change their rules and policies which may adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 
changes in policies of the us government may also adversely affect our military base contract operations 
in certain circumstances  the us government may be unwilling or unable to appropriate funds to pay costs mandated by changes in rules and policies of state regulatory agencies or may seek bids on work that we believe is covered by the contract awarded to us  thereby reducing the returns that we anticipated at the time of execution of the contract 
the us government may also delay approval of requests for equitable adjustment or redetermination of prices which could adversely affect our anticipated rates of return 
we may also be subject to fines or penalties if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws  regulations or orders applicable to our businesses  unless we appeal this determination or our appeal of an adverse determination is denied 
our costs involved in maintaining water quality and complying with environmental regulation have increased and are expected to continue to increase our capital and operating costs have increased substantially as a result of increases in environmental regulation arising from increases in the cost of disposing of residuals from our water treatment plants  upgrading and building new water treatment plants  monitoring compliance activities and securing alternative supplies when necessary 
our public utilities may be able to recover these costs through the ratemaking process 
we may also be able to recover these costs under contractual arrangements 
in certain circumstances  costs may be recoverable from parties responsible or potentially responsible for contamination  either voluntarily or through specific court action 

table of contents we may also incur significant costs in connection with seeking to recover costs due to contamination of water supplies 
our ability to recover these types of costs also depends upon a variety of factors  including approval of rate increases  the willingness of potentially responsible parties to settle litigation and otherwise address the contamination and the extent and magnitude of the contamination 
we can give no assurance regarding the adequacy of any such recovery to offset the costs associated with the contamination or the cost of recovery of these costs 
our subsidiaries operating water and or wastewater systems on military bases are also subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
the contracts provide various mechanisms for recovery of costs  including increasing revenues through change in conditions provisions and equitable adjustment procedures 
our contracts with the us government are  however  subject to the anti deficiency act 
as a result  our recovery of these costs may depend upon congressional action to appropriate funds 
additional risks associated with our public utility operations our operating costs have increased and are expected to continue to increase as a result of groundwater contamination our operations are impacted by groundwater contamination in certain service territories 
we have taken a number of steps to address contamination  including the removal of wells from service  decreasing the amount of groundwater pumped from wells in order to slow the movement of plumes of contaminated water  constructing water treatment facilities and securing alternative sources of supply from other areas not affected by the contamination 
in some cases  potentially responsible parties have reimbursed us for some or all of our costs 
in other cases  we have taken legal action against parties believed to be potentially responsible for the contamination 
to date  the cpuc has permitted us to establish memorandum accounts in california for potential recovery of these types of costs 
as a result  our memorandum and water supply balancing accounts are high by historical standards 
we can give no assurance regarding the outcome of litigation arising out of contamination or our ability to recover these costs in the future 
persons who are potentially responsible for causing the contamination of groundwater supplies have also been increasingly asserting claims against water distributors on a variety of theories and have thus far brought the water distributors including us within the class of potentially responsible parties in federal court actions pending in los angeles county 
this increases the costs and risks of seeking recovery of these costs 
management believes that rate recovery  proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to appropriately manage these types of claims 
however  such claims  if ultimately resolved unfavorably to us  could  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of uncontrollable factors the adequacy of our water supplies varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors  including rainfall  runoff  flood control and availability of reservoir storage  availability of colorado river water and imported water from northern california  the amount of useable water stored in reservoirs and groundwater basins  the amount of water used by our customers and others  water quality  and legal limitations on production  diversion  storage  conveyance and use 
population growth and increases in the amount of water used in california and arizona have caused increased stress on surface water supplies and groundwater basins 
the importation of water from the colorado river  one of our important sources of supply has decreased due to implementation of the california plan which limits the amount of water that the metropolitan water district of southern california  or mwd  is entitled to take from the colorado river 
in addition  new court ordered pumping restrictions on water obtained from the sacramento san joaquin delta have decreased the amount of water mwd is able to import from northern california 
we are cooperating with mwd to secure additional supplies from conservation  desalination and water exchanges with agricultural water users  but it is not known to what extent these efforts will be successful and sustainable 
ccwc obtains its water supply from operating wells and from the colorado river through the central arizona project  or cap 
ccwc s water supply may be subject to interruption or reduction if there is an interruption or reduction in water supplies available to cap 
in addition  ccwc s ability to provide water service to new real estate developments is dependent upon ccwc s ability to meet the requirements of the arizona department of water resources regarding the ccwc s assured water supply account 

table of contents water shortages may adversely affect our supply mix  for instance  causing increased reliance upon more expensive water sources  adversely affect our operating costs  for instance  by increasing the cost of producing water from more highly contaminated aquifers  result in an increase in our capital expenditures  for example by requiring the construction of pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply  new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers  and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water  and adversely affect the volume of water sold as a result of mandatory or voluntary conservation efforts by customers 
we may be able to recover increased operating and capital costs through the ratemaking process 
we implemented a modified supply cost balancing account to track and recover costs from our supply mix changes  as authorized by the cpuc  in november we may also recover costs from certain third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
our liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in water supply costs we obtain our water supplies for gswc and ccwc from a variety of sources 
for example  water is pumped from aquifers within our service areas to meet a portion of the demands of our customers 
when water produced from wells is insufficient to meet customer demand or when such production is interrupted  we have purchased water from other suppliers 
as a result  our cost of providing  distributing and treating water for our customers use can vary significantly 
furthermore  imported water wholesalers  such as mwd and cap may not always have an adequate supply of water to sell to us 
we have established water supply cost balancing accounts at gswc for expenses of purchased water  purchased power and groundwater related pump taxes for our water service areas 
under the water supply cost balancing account procedures prior to november  changes in water supply costs  such as those that occurred due to changes in supply mix purchased water volume vs 
pumped water  for instance compared to the authorized amount historically directly affected our earnings 
in november  the cpuc authorized gswc to implement a modified balancing account that permits gswc to reflect changes in all water supply costs  including those due to changes in water supply mix  in the balancing account 
our liquidity and earnings could be adversely affected by increases in maintenance costs due to our aging infrastructure some of our systems in california are more than to years old 
we have experienced a high number of leaks  water quality and mechanical problems in some of these older systems 
in addition  well and pump maintenance expenses continue to increase due to rising labor and material costs and more stringent water discharge requirements 
these costs can and do increase unexpectedly and in substantial amounts 
we include increases in maintenance costs in each general rate case filed by our rate regulated public utilities for possible recovery 
however  we estimate the amount of expenses expected to be incurred during future years in california 
we may not recover overages from those estimates in rates  which may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
our liquidity and earnings may be adversely affected by our conservation efforts conservation by all customer classes at gswc and ccwc is a top priority 
however  customer conservation can result in lower volumes of water sold 
we are also experiencing a decline in per residential customer water usage due to the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances by residential consumers  and perhaps  efforts by our customers to reduce costs as a result of adverse economic conditions 
our public utilities businesses are heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates charged to our residential customers for the volume of water used 
the rates we charge for water are regulated by the cpuc and the acc and may not be unilaterally adjusted to reflect changes in demand 
declining usage also negatively impacts our long term operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or if growth in the residential customer base does not occur to the extent necessary to offset the per customer residential usage decline 
in november  we implemented a water revenue adjustment mechanism at gswc which has the effect of reducing  in part  the adverse impacts of our customers conservation efforts 

table of contents our earnings may be affected  to some extent  by weather during different seasons the demand for water and electricity varies by season 
for instance  most water consumption occurs during the third quarter of each year when weather in california and arizona tends to be hot and dry 
during unusually wet weather  our customers generally use less water 
in november  gswc implemented a new conservation rate design and a water revenue adjustment mechanism approved by the cpuc at two of its water regions  which should help mitigate fluctuations in revenues and earnings due to changes in water consumption in california 
ccwc s revenues and profitability will  however  continue to be impacted by changes in water consumption in arizona 
the demand for electricity in our electric customer service area is greatly affected by winter snows 
an increase in winter snows reduces the use of snowmaking machines at ski resorts in the big bear area and  as a result  reduces our electric revenues 
likewise  unseasonably warm weather during a skiing season may result in temperatures too high for snowmaking conditions  which also reduces our electric revenues 
we have requested a revenue adjustment mechanism from the cpuc for our electric business which  if approved  should help mitigate fluctuations in the revenues and earnings of our electric business due to changes in the amount of electricity used by gswc s customers 
our liquidity  and in certain circumstances  earnings  may be adversely affected by increases in electricity and natural gas prices in california we purchase most of our electric energy sold to customers in our electric customer service area from others under purchased power contracts 
in addition to purchased power contracts  we purchase additional energy from the spot market to meet peak demand 
we may sell surplus power to the spot market during times of reduced energy demand 
we also operate a natural gas fueled megawatt  or mw  generator in our electric service area 
during the energy crisis in late and  we incurred approximately million of additional energy purchase costs that were not covered in rates 
the cpuc authorized a surcharge of per kilowatt hour from our customers through august to recover this under collected balance 
based on projected electricity sales  we expect to recover all of this under collected balance 
in addition  the cpuc authorized recovery of energy purchase costs from customers  up to an annual weighted average cost of per mwh each year through august we are required to write off costs in excess of this cap 
as a result  we are at risk for increases in spot market prices of electricity purchased and for decreases in spot market prices for electricity sold 
since the energy crisis in late  the under collection in our energy supply cost balancing account incurred during the energy crisis has decreased to million as a result of the surcharge 
however  this decrease has been offset by increases in the supply cost balancing account primarily due to increases in costs associated with the transportation of energy 
unexpected generator downtime or a failure to perform by any of the counterparties to our electric and natural gas purchase contracts could further increase our exposure to fluctuating natural gas and electric prices 
changes in electricity prices also affected the unrealized gains and losses on our block forward purchased power contracts that qualify as derivative instruments as we adjusted the asset or liability on these contracts to reflect the fair market value of the contracts at the end of each month 
these unrealized gains and losses have been reflected in earnings prior to january  we have filed an application with the cpuc to review our new purchased power contracts  effective after december  in this filing  we also requested the cpuc s authorization of a memorandum account to track the changes in the fair market value of the contracts resulting in unrealized gains and losses 
if this application is approved  unrealized gains and losses on these purchased power contracts will not impact earnings 
our assets are subject to condemnation municipalities and other government subdivisions may  in certain circumstances  seek to acquire certain of our assets through eminent domain proceedings 
it is generally our practice to contest these proceedings which may be costly and may divert the attention of management from the operation of our business 
if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring our assets  there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the assets acquired or be able to recover all charges associated with divesting these assets 

table of contents additional risks associated with our contracted services we derive revenues from contract operations primarily from the operation and maintenance of water and or wastewater systems at military bases and the construction of water and wastewater improvements to the infrastructure on these bases 
as a result  these operations are subject to risks that are different than those of our public utility operations 
our operations and maintenance contracts on military bases create certain risks that are different from that of our regulated utility operations we have entered into contracts to provide water and or wastewater services at military bases pursuant to year contracts  subject to termination  in whole or in part  for the convenience of the us government 
in addition  the us government may stop work under the terms of the contracts  delay performance of our obligations under the contracts or modify the contracts at its convenience 
our contract pricing was based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials 
we may be unable to recover all costs if any of these assumptions are inaccurate or if all costs that we may incur in connection with performing the work were not considered 
our operations and maintenance contracts are also subject to periodic price adjustments at the time of price redetermination or in connection with requests for equitable adjustments or other changes permitted by the terms of the contracts 
the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
prices are also subject to equitable adjustment based upon changes in circumstances and changes in wages and fringe benefits to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
we have experienced delays in the redetermination of prices following completion of the first two years of operation under our operation and maintenance contracts in effect for more than two years 
we have also experienced delays in obtaining a final equitable adjustment of prices for the significantly higher infrastructure at certain of the bases than that described by the us government in its request for proposal 
these delays have negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows 
further delays will impact our future earnings and cash flows 
we are required to record all costs incurred under these types of contracts as these costs are incurred 
as a result  we have been recording losses associated with unanticipated conditions that we have encountered at fort bliss and our two new bases in north carolina and south carolina 
we will reverse previously recorded costs as  and to the extent that  our requests for equitable adjustments are approved 
we are subject to audits  cost review and investigations by contracting oversight agencies 
during the course of an audit  the oversight agency may disallow costs 
such cost disallowances may result in adjustments to previously reported revenues 
payment under these contracts is subject to appropriations by congress 
we may experience delays in receiving payment or delays in redetermination of prices or other price adjustments due to cancelled or delayed appropriations specific to our projects or reductions in government spending for the military generally or military base operations 
appropriations and the timing of payment may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures for the military generally or military base operations specifically 
in addition  we must maintain the proper management of water and wastewater facilities  employ state certified and other qualified employees to support the operation of these facilities and otherwise comply with contract requirements 

table of contents risks associated with the collection  treatment and disposal of wastewater are different  in some respects  from that of our water utility operations the wastewater collection  treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries providing water and or wastewater services on military bases are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks 
if collection or sewage systems fail  overflow or do not operate properly  untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers  causing damage to persons or property  injury to aquatic life and economic damages  which may not be recoverable in fees 
this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding  which are common causes of sewer overflow and system failure 
liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow  our losses might not be covered by insurance policies or we may find it difficult to secure insurance for this business in the future at acceptable rates 
our contracts for the construction of infrastructure improvements on military bases create risks that are different  in some respects  from that of our operations and maintenance contracts we have entered into contracts for the construction of infrastructure improvements to water and wastewater systems at military bases 
many of these contracts are fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we benefit from cost savings and earnings  but are generally unable to recover any cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under extenuating circumstances  the us government has approved increased cost change orders 
we recognize revenues from these types of contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this accounting practice results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on periodic estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability as the construction projects progress 
we establish prices for these types of fixed price contracts based  in part  on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our contracted business operations and results of operations for contracted services 
we may be adversely affected by disputes with the us government regarding our performance of contract services on military bases if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows will be adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with the terms of one or more of our us government contracts  other agreements with the us government or us government regulations and statutes  we could be suspended or barred from future us government contracts for a period of time and be subject to possible damages  fines and penalties and damage to our reputation in the water and wastewater industry 
we depend  to some extent  upon subcontractors to assist us in the performance of contracted services on military bases we rely  to some extent  on subcontractors to assist us in the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at a number of military bases  subject to our existing contracts with the us government 
the failure of any of these subcontractors to perform services for us in accordance with the terms of our contracts with the us government could result in the termination of our contracts to provide water and or wastewater services at these bases  a loss of revenues or increases in costs to correct as a result of a subcontractor s performance failures 
we are able to mitigate these risks  in part  by obtaining  and requiring our subcontractors to obtain  performance bonds 
we are also required to make a good faith effort to achieve our small business subcontracting plan goals pursuant to us government regulation 
if we fail to use good faith efforts to meet these goals  the us government may assess damages against us at the end of the contract or  in some cases  at the end of each price redetermination period 
the us government has the right to offset claimed damages against any amounts owed to us 
we also rely on third party manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to complete our construction projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount of costs we incur for these projects exceeds the amount we have estimated in our bid  we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a 
table of contents subcontractor or manufacturer is unable to deliver its services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition  we may be required to purchase the services  equipment or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services  equipment or materials were needed 
if these subcontractors fail to perform services to be provided to us or fail to provide us with the proper equipment or materials  we may be penalized for their failure to perform 
we continue to incur costs associated with the expansion of our contract activities we continue to incur additional costs in connection with the expansion of our contract operations associated with the preparation of bids and the negotiation of the terms of new contracts for contract operations on military bases and compliance with regulatory requirements associated with our water marketing efforts 
our ability to recover these costs and to earn a profit on our contract operations will depend upon the extent to which we are successful in obtaining new contracts on military bases and satisfying regulatory requirements associated with our water marketing efforts and recovering these costs and other costs from new contract revenues 
other risks our business requires significant capital expenditures the utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums of money for additions to  or replacement of  our property  plant and equipment at our california and arizona utilities 
we obtain funds for these capital projects from operations  contributions by developers and others and advances from developers which are repaid over a period of time at no interest 
we also periodically borrow money or issue equity for these purposes 
in addition  we have a syndicated bank credit facility that is partially used for these purposes 
we cannot provide assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return 
our subsidiaries providing water and wastewater services on military bases also expect to incur significant capital expenditures 
to the extent that the us government does not reimburse us for these expenditures as the work is performed  the us government will repay us over time with interest 
however  if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows will be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by the current financial crisis due to recent capital market events  there has been a decline in the fair value of the assets in our pension and postretirement benefit plans since december  this decline in market value will significantly increase our pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses in to the extent that this decline in market value continues or is not reversed and is not offset by changes in the discount rate  pension and postretirement benefit plan expenses may also increase in subsequent years  negatively impacting earnings 
if market conditions do not improve  we will also need to increase our cash contributions to these plans in and subsequent years 
we include increases in pension and postretirement cost in each general rate case filed by our public utilities for possible recovery 
however  we estimate the amount of expenses expected to be incurred during future years in california 
we may not recover overages from those estimates in rates  which may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
in march  we filed an advice letter with the cpuc requesting authorization to establish a pension costs memorandum account 
if this account is approved  we will track the difference between the pension costs authorized by the cpuc and included in customer rates  and our actual pension costs 
we will not record the amounts in this account as a regulatory asset until they are reviewed and approved by the cpuc 
if approved by the cpuc  we will then establish a regulatory asset with a corresponding increase to earnings 
until then  we expect that our earnings will be negatively affected by increasing pension costs 
we obtain funds from external sources to finance our on going capital expenditures 
access to external financing on reasonable terms depends  in part  on conditions in the debt and equity markets 
when business and market conditions deteriorate we may no longer have access to the capital markets on reasonable terms 
our ability to obtain funds is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity to third parties or obtaining funds from our revolving credit facility 
if the current financial turmoil continues for an extended period of time  it may become necessary for us to seek funds on unattractive terms 
moreover  we also have goodwill at ccwc and asus that may be adversely impacted if economic conditions worsen 
we anticipate a loss of customers and an increase in charge offs as a result of rising unemployment  residential foreclosure and business failures 
we also anticipate a reduction in water usage due to the loss of income and the decline in 
table of contents wealth of customers in our services areas 
our ability to collect amounts owed to us by other third parties could also be adversely impacted by the current financial crisis 
we are unable to predict at this time how we may otherwise be impacted by this financial crisis 
our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in our long term debt agreements and credit facility could trigger prepayment obligations our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our long term debt agreements could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay or refinance these borrowings before their due dates on less favorable terms 
if we are forced to repay or refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and interest rates 
we are a holding company that depends on cash flow from gswc to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all operations and our only significant assets are investments in our subsidiaries 
this means that we are dependent on distributions of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares 
more than of our earnings are derived from the operations of gswc 
moreover  none of our other subsidiaries has paid any dividends to us during the past three years 
as a result  we are largely dependent on cash flow from gswc to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt 
our subsidiaries only pay dividends if and when declared by the subsidiary board 
moreover  gswc is obligated to give first priority to its own capital requirements and to maintain a capital structure consistent with that determined to be reasonable by the cpuc in its most recent decision on capital structure  in order that ratepayers not be adversely affected by the holding company structure 
furthermore  our right to receive cash or other assets in the unlikely event of liquidation or reorganization of gswc is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
if we are unable to obtain funds from gswc in a timely manner  we may be unable to meet our financial obligations  make additional investments or pay dividends 
a disruption of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business we depend on our information technology  or it  systems to bill customers  process orders  provide customer service  manage construction projects  manage our financial records  track assets  remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources  inventory and accounts receivable collections 
our it systems also allow us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis  maintain cost effective operations and provide service to our customers 
a serious disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business and our ability to provide service to our customers 
our it systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss  computer systems failures and internet  telecommunications or data network failures  user negligence or improper operation by  or supervision of  employees  physical and electronic loss of customer data or security breaches  misappropriation and similar events  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events  and hurricanes  fires  floods  earthquakes and other natural disasters 
such damages or interruptions may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data  security breaches  misappropriation and similar events 

table of contents our operations are geographically concentrated in california although we operate water and wastewater facilities in a number of states  our operations are concentrated in california  particularly southern california 
as a result  our financial results are largely subject to political  water supply  labor  utility cost and regulatory risks  economic conditions and other economic risks affecting california 
california has been particularly hard hit by the current economic crisis 
california is raising taxes in order to balance the state budget and jobs may be lost to other states which are perceived as having a more business friendly climate  thereby exacerbating the impact of the financial crisis in california 
consequently  we anticipate a loss of gswc customers and an increase in charge offs as a result of rising unemployment  residential foreclosure and business failures in california 
we operate in areas subject to natural disasters or that may be the target of terrorist activities we operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes  fires  mudslides and other natural disasters 
while we maintain insurance policies to help reduce our financial exposure  a significant seismic event in southern california  where our operations are concentrated  or other natural disasters in california could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations 
the cpuc has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover these costs 
terrorists could seek to disrupt service to our customers by targeting our assets 
we have invested in additional security for facilities throughout our regulated service areas to mitigate the risks of terrorist activities 
we also may be prevented from providing water and or wastewater services at the military bases we serve in times of military crisis affecting these bases

table of contents condemnation of properties the laws of the state of california and the state of arizona provide for the acquisition of public utility property by governmental agencies through their power of eminent domain  also known as condemnation  where doing so is necessary and in the public interest 
in addition  however  the laws of california provide i that the owner of utility property may contest whether the condemnation is actually necessary and in the public interest  and ii that the owner is entitled to receive the fair market value of its property if the property is ultimately taken 
although the city of claremont  california the city located in gswc s region iii  has not initiated the formal condemnation process pursuant to california law  the city has expressed various concerns to gswc about the rates charged by gswc and the effectiveness of the cpuc s rate setting procedures 
the city hired a consultant to perform an appraisal of the value of gswc s water system serving the city 
the value was estimated in by the city s consultant at to million

item legal proceedings water quality related litigation perchlorate and or volatile organic compounds voc have been detected in five wells servicing gswc s south san gabriel system 
gswc filed suit in federal court  along with two other affected water purveyors san gabriel valley water company and city of monterey park  and the san gabriel basin water quality authority wqa  against some of those allegedly responsible for the contamination of two of these wells 
the lawsuit was filed on august  in the united states district court for the central district of california 
some of the other potential defendants settled with gswc  other water purveyors and the wqa the water entities  on voc related issues prior to the filing of the lawsuit 
in response to the filing of the lawsuit  the potentially responsible party prp defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit or strike certain portions of the suit 
the judge issued a ruling on april  granting in part and denying in part the prp s motions 
a key ruling of the court was that the water purveyors  including gswc  by virtue of their ownership of wells contaminated with hazardous chemicals are themselves prps under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
gswc has  pursuant to permission of the court  amended its suit to claim certain affirmative defenses as an innocent party under cercla 
registrant is presently unable to predict the outcome of this ruling on its ability to fully recover from the prps future costs associated with the treatment of these wells 
in this same suit  the prps have filed cross complaints against the water entities  the mwd  the main san gabriel basin watermaster and others on the theory that they arranged for and did transport contaminated water into the main san gabriel basin for use by gswc and the other two affected water purveyors and for other related claims 
on august   the us environmental protection agency epa issued unilateral administrative orders uao against parties deemed responsible for polluting the groundwater in that portion of the san gabriel valley from which these two impacted wells draw water 
gswc was not named as a party to the uao 
the uao requires that these parties remediate the contamination 
the judge in the lawsuit has appointed a special master to oversee mandatory settlement discussions between the prps and the water entities 
epa is also conducting settlement discussions with several prps regarding the uao 
the water entities and epa are working to coordinate their settlement discussions under the special master in order to arrive at a complete resolution of all issues affecting the lawsuit and the uao 
settlements with a number of the prps are being finalized  however  registrant is presently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these settlement discussions 

table of contents santa maria groundwater basin adjudication in  the santa maria valley water conservation district plaintiff filed a lawsuit against multiple defendants  including gswc  the city of santa maria  and several other public water purveyors 
the lawsuit was filed on july  in the santa clara county superior court santa maria valley water conservation district v 
city of santa maria  et al lead case no 
cv  consolidated with case nos 
cv       the plaintiff s lawsuit sought an adjudication of the santa maria groundwater basin the basin 
a stipulated settlement of the lawsuit has been reached  subject to cpuc approval 
the settlement  among other things  if approved by the cpuc  would preserve gswc s historical pumping rights and secure supplemental water rights for use in case of drought or other reductions in the natural yield of the basin 
gswc  under the stipulation  has a right to  acre feet of groundwater replenishment provided by the twitchell project  a storage and flood control reservoir project operated by the santa maria valley conservation district 
a monitoring and annual reporting program has been established to allow the parties to responsibly manage the basin and to respond to shortage conditions 
if severe water shortage conditions are found over a period of five years  the management area engineer will make findings and recommendations to alleviate such shortages 
in the unlikely case that the basin experiences severe shortage conditions  the court has the authority to limit gswc s groundwater production to  acre feet per year  based on developed water in the basin 
on february   the court issued its final judgment  which approves and incorporates the stipulation 
the judgment awards gswc prescriptive rights to groundwater against the non stipulating parties 
in addition  the judgment grants gswc the right to use the basin for temporary storage and to recapture percent of the return flows that are generated from its importation of state water project water

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets and where necessary  includes specific references to awr s individual segments and or other subsidiaries gswc  ccwc  asus and its subsidiaries 
overview registrant s revenues  operating income and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses through approximately  miles of water distribution pipelines and the delivery of electricity in the big bear area of san bernardino county 
rates charged to customers of gswc and ccwc are determined by the cpuc and acc  respectively 
these rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital 
factors affecting financial performance of our regulated utilities include the process and timing of setting rates charged to customers  the ability to recover  and the process for recovering in rates  the costs of distributing water and electricity and our overhead costs  weather  the impact of increased water quality standards and environmental regulations on the cost of operations and capital expenditures  pressures on water supply caused by population growth  more stringent water quality standards  deterioration in water quality and water supply from a variety of causes  capital expenditures needed to upgrade water systems and increased costs  and risks associated with litigation relating to water quality and water supply  including suits initiated by registrant to protect its water supply 
operating revenues and income from contracted services at asus and its subsidiaries are earned primarily from the operation and maintenance of water and or wastewater systems for the us government at various military bases 
all of the operations and maintenance contracts with the us government are year firm  fixed price contracts with prospective price redeterminations 
asus also may generate revenues from the construction of infrastructure improvements at these bases pursuant to the terms of these year contracts or pursuant to supplemental contracts 
revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on these new business activities  including military base operations and the construction of new and or replacement infrastructure at these military bases 
as a result  asus is subject to risks that are different than those of registrant s regulated water and electric utilities 
asus plans to continue seeking contracts for the operation and maintenance of water and or wastewater services at military bases 
factors affecting the financial performance of our military utility privatization subsidiaries include delays in receiving payments from the us government and the redetermination and equitable adjustment of prices under contracts with the us government 
registrant plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
capital expenditures in future years are expected to remain at much higher levels than depreciation expense 
cash solely from operations is not expected to be sufficient to fund registrant s needs for capital expenditures  dividends  investments in registrant s contract business and other cash requirements 
registrant expects to fund a portion of these needs through a combination of debt and common stock offerings over the next twelve months depending on market conditions 
on august   awr amended its million syndicated credit facility  to increase its aggregate bank commitments by million to million 
in addition  a senior note in the amount of million has been issued on march   to cobank  acb cobank 
under the terms of this senior note  cobank purchased a senior note due march  in the aggregate principal amount of million from gswc 
the proceeds will be used to pay down gswc s intercompany short term borrowings and to fund capital expenditures 
for  net income was million compared to million in  a decrease of 
diluted earnings per share for were compared to in the decrease in earnings is due primarily to i decreased water consumption and higher operating expenses at gswc  ii a goodwill impairment charge of million at ccwc  iii and the reduced financial performance of the military utility privatization subsidiaries 
prior to the implementation of gswc s water revenue adjustment mechanism in november  gswc s earnings were affected by decreased consumption 
gswc s water consumption in decreased by approximately as compared to  or per share 
although precipitation was overall lower in most of with the exception of the first quarter  compared to the same period in  the water revenues appear to have been impacted by the effects of state wide customer conservation efforts 
due to the implementation of gswc s water revenue adjustment mechanism in late november  earnings were favorably impacted by approximately per share in the fourth quarter of that would have previously been lost due to conservation 
therefore  the net impact due to lower sales in was per share 
higher operating expenses in  as compared to the same period of last year  also negatively impacted gswc s earnings in these decreases in gswc s earnings were partially offset by increases in customer rates approved by the cpuc and effective january  and a lower effective income tax rate 

table of contents during  a charge of million  or per share  was recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill at ccwc in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the recent impairment testing  registrant determined that revenue growth for its arizona utility  ccwc  was likely to be slower than originally projected due to downturns in overall economic conditions and new housing construction  as well as the current regulatory environment in arizona resulting in regulatory lags and lower than anticipated rate increases 
registrant s results have also been affected by the reduced financial performance of asus contracted service operations at military bases  due to increases in operating expenses primarily incurred at two bases in north carolina and south carolina under new operating and maintenance contracts 
asus incurred higher than anticipated operating costs  losses on certain construction projects under these new contracts and emergency construction activities not anticipated in the contracts to address the age and pre existing condition of the infrastructure 
asus is attempting to recover these increased costs through the equitable adjustment provisions of the contracts for these two bases 
moreover  asus results in included a significant wastewater expansion project at fort bliss that added about per share 
there was no similar significant project during the year ended december  asus overall performance in decreased by per share when compared to unrealized gains and losses on purchased power contracts have been impacting gswc s earnings since when gswc entered into certain purchase power contracts 
these contracts qualified as derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts was million increasing net income by per share in compared to million or per share for the same period of  a per share decrease in earnings between the two periods 
summary results by segment awr has three reportable segments water  electric and contracted services 
within the segments  awr has three principal business units water and electric service utility operations conducted through gswc  a water service utility operation conducted through ccwc  and a contracted services unit conducted through asus and its subsidiaries 
the tables below set forth summaries of the results by segment in thousands for the years ended december  and operating revenues pretax operating income year year year year ended ended ended ended change change change change water electric contracted services awr parent totals from operation water for the year ended december   pretax operating income for water decreased by million compared to the year ended december   or 
the decrease was  due in large part  to the goodwill impairment charge of million  or per share  recorded at ccwc in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as more fully described later 
the dollar water margin increased million as compared to the same period of due to higher water rates approved by the cpuc effective january   offset by lower water consumption 
an approximately decrease in water consumption during the year of resulted in a million decrease in water revenues  or per share 
this decrease in consumption occurred even though precipitation was overall lower in most of with the exception of the first quarter as compared to differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas as well as the effects of conservation  have impacted consumption of water by customers causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparable periods 
in august  the cpuc issued a final decision regarding conservation rate design that allows for the establishment and implementation of a water revenue adjustment mechanism wram to decouple sales from revenues and a modified cost balancing account mcba to remove the impact to earnings due to supply mix changes 
gswc prospectively implemented the new wram and mcba in late november for regions ii and iii 
this should help mitigate fluctuations in registrant s future water margin due to changes in water consumption and supply mix 
in addition  the cpuc also approved an advice letter filed by gswc to allow gswc to create and implement a water conservation memorandum account wcma to track the extraordinary expenses and revenue shortfall associated with conservation measures in conjunction with the declared drought in california 
see further discussion on conservation included in the 
table of contents regulatory matters section 
with the implementation of the wram and mcba in late november  earnings were favorably impacted by approximately per share in the fourth quarter of that would have previously been lost due to conservation 
therefore  the net impact due to lower sales in was per share 
higher operating expenses  as more fully described later  decreased pretax operating income by million 
electric for the year ended december   pretax operating income from electric operations decreased by million due in part to a decrease of  in the pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the unrealized gain on purchased power contracts increased operating income by approximately million for the year of  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  for the same period in the remainder of the decrease was due primarily to an increase of  in allocation of costs from corporate headquarters to bves and a lower electric margin resulting from lower electric usage and reconnection fees 
contracted services for the year ended december   the pretax operating income for contracted services decreased by million to a pretax loss of  this was primarily due to losses incurred at military bases under two new contracts 
asus began operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems under two new contracts in north carolina and south carolina during the first quarter of pretax operating losses at these two bases were million for the year ended december   including  for emergency construction and maintenance at psus to address pre existing conditions not anticipated in the contract and for which asus is pursuing recovery from the us government  and  in anticipated losses associated with certain initial capital upgrade projects 
in september  psus submitted a request for equitable adjustment rea for the water and wastewater systems at fort jackson  south carolina requesting a contract modification for these initial capital upgrades and emergency construction costs 
the aggregate value of the rea relating to construction work is approximately million 
the rea has not yet been approved by the us government  and therefore  the anticipated losses on these projects and the emergency costs have been recorded during in construction expense 
in addition  asus plans to submit an rea for the water and wastewater systems at fort bragg pope air force base in north carolina upon completion of the us government s review of the joint inventory report filed by asus in august the joint inventory report indicates the quantity of the fort bragg pope air force base infrastructure to be greater than what was assumed under the original year contract 
higher than anticipated transition costs  increases in nonincome tax assessments and other operating expenses also contributed to the losses 
pretax operating income at the other military bases under existing contracts increased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period last year 
during  there was a million wastewater expansion construction project at fort bliss with the us government that generated approximately million in pretax operating income during the project was completed in august however  asus subsidiaries did undertake similar construction activity in that were on a smaller scale and helped replace construction revenues and operating income generated from the wastewater expansion project in earnings and cash flows from amendments and modifications to the original year contracts with the us government are sporadic and may or may not continue in future periods 
the timely receipt of price redeterminations is critical in order for asus to recover increasing costs for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems at the military bases 
in addition  higher allocations of corporate headquarters expenses to asus and its wholly owned subsidiaries by the cpuc were not contemplated at the time the contracts with the us government were negotiated and will be addressed in future price redeterminations 
under the terms of these contracts  the contract price is subject to price redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter 
redeterminations have been submitted and are under review by the us government for operations of odus and tus in virginia and maryland  respectively 
the price redeterminations are expected to be completed in pending redetermination of prices  asus has received interim inflation adjustments during to the management fees for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems at fort eustis  fort story and fort monroe in virginia  and the wastewater system at fort lee also in virginia effective on the second anniversary of the date when asus began operating these bases february  for fort lee and april  for the other three bases 
fbws has experienced delays in the redetermination of prices at fort bliss following completion of the first two years of operation in october at fort bliss  management fees for operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems are based on cost levels prevailing in when the contract with the us government was bid 
further  the contract pricing was also based on assumptions about the size and age of the infrastructure to be operated and maintained over the year contract 
the rea had been filed as a claim with the us government to adequately reflect the amount of assets included in the infrastructure at fort bliss  which is substantially more than originally estimated by the us government as part of its solicitation for this contract 
in december  the us government approved an interim adjustment at fort bliss which increased the monthly water and wastewater fees by and  respectively 
the increase was retroactive to october  and is expected to generate approximately million of additional revenues annually

asus is continuing negotiations with fort bliss to finalize the adjustment necessary due to the increased infrastructure and will also be preparing a price redetermination request for fort bliss which it expects to file by mid these price redeterminations and equitable adjustments  which include adjustments to reflect changes in operating conditions and infrastructure levels from that assumed at the time of the execution of the contracts  as well as inflation in costs  are expected to provide added revenues prospectively to help offset increased costs and provide registrant the opportunity to generate positive operating income at its military utility privatization subsidiaries 
as of december   asus has million of goodwill  which may be at risk for potential impairment if requested price redeterminations and equitable adjustments that have not yet been approved  are not received

an unrealized gain on purchased power contracts which increased pretax income during the year ended december  by million  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  for the same period in  a net decrease of per share 
increased water rates partially offset by higher water supply costs contributed per share to earnings while an approximate decrease in water usage during the year ended december  resulted in a million decrease in water revenues  or per share 
the water revenues appear to have been impacted by the effects of state wide customer conservation efforts 
as previously mentioned  with the implementation of the wram and mcba in late november  earnings were favorably impacted by approximately per 
table of contents share in the fourth quarter of that would have previously been lost due to conservation 
therefore  the net impact due to lower sales in was per share 
as a result of these individual factors  the overall dollar water margin increased by million  or per share  during the year ended december  pretax operating income for contracted services declined by million  or per share  during the year ended december  due primarily to losses incurred at new bases 
asus commenced operation of water and wastewater systems at military bases in north carolina and south carolina during the first quarter of and has incurred higher than anticipated transition  maintenance and emergency construction costs as well as projected losses on certain construction contracts 
current estimates of construction costs compared to contract revenues indicate losses on certain initial capital upgrade projects 
modifications or change orders have not yet been approved by the us government  and therefore  the anticipated losses on these projects and pre contract costs have been recorded in construction expenses during registrant recorded a net gain on sale of property of  or per share  during the year ended december  there was no similar gain in the same period of gswc recorded  in interest income  or per share  during the second quarter of in connection with the irs s examination of the income tax return 
a significant decrease in the effective income tax rate during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  due primarily to changes between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements favorably impacted earnings by per share during higher other expenses at gswc in primarily consisting of administrative  general  depreciation and other operating expenses as described below  contributed to an overall decrease of per diluted share to the results of operations 
operating revenues water for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  contributing to this increase were the following i rate increases in all three gswc water regions approved by the cpuc effective january   which added approximately million to water revenues during the year ended december   ii an increase in water revenues of million due to the surcharge approved by the cpuc effective in may to recover region iii s under collection in supply costs  this increase in revenues is offset by a corresponding amount in the supply cost balancing accounts discussed below  resulting in no impact to pretax operating income  iii the adoption of the wram effective november  at which time gswc began recording the difference between what is billed to its metered customers in regions ii and iii and that which is authorized by the cpuc  and as a result  gswc recorded million of additional revenues caused by the under collection in the wram accounts during the month of december  and iv the recording of  in july of additional revenues in connection with corrections to the rate calculation for region iii 
these increases in water revenues were partially offset by a decrease of approximately in water consumption due to conservation during  which caused water revenues to be lower by approximately million 
the implementation of the wram should help mitigate fluctuations in registrant s future revenues due to changes in water consumption 
the decline in the number of customers did not result in a significant decrease in water revenues 
electric for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to a decrease of in electric usage and lower connections and reconnection fees 
the effects of lower electric usage were partially offset by an adjustment of  in december resulting from bves low income program balancing account which reduced electric revenues during there was no similar adjustment made during 
table of contents contracted services revenues from contracted services are composed of construction revenues and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and or wastewater systems at military bases 
for the year ended december   revenues from contracted services increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  approximately million in new revenue was generated from management fees for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems under the two new contracts in north carolina and south carolina  both of which began during the first quarter of there was also approximately million in construction and transition revenues at these two bases 
at the other bases under existing contracts in and  there was an increase of  in management fees due primarily to interim increases at fbws and odus 
this was offset by a net decrease of million in construction revenues at these existing bases during when compared to in  a wastewater expansion project at fort bliss generated million of construction revenues out of a total of million for all asus subsidiaries during the year ended december  the project was completed in august and did not recur in although there was no similar singularly significant project during  asus subsidiaries did undertake similar construction activities in that were on a smaller scale and collectively helped replace construction revenues generated from the wastewater expansion project in earnings and cash flows from amendments and modifications to the original year contracts with the us government are sporadic and may or may not continue in future periods 

table of contents operating expenses supply costs supply costs for the water segment consist of purchased water  purchased power for pumping  groundwater production assessment and water supply cost balancing accounts 
supply costs for the electric segment consist of power purchased for resale including the cost of natural gas and the electric supply cost balancing accounts 
water and electric margins are computed by taking total revenues  less total supply costs 
registrant uses these margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results 
registrant believes this measure is a useful internal benchmark in evaluating the utility business performance within its water and electric segments 
registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to its operating budget as approved 
however  this measure  which is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income  which is determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of operating performance 
total supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses 
supply costs accounted for approximately and of total operating expenses for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the table below provides the amount of increases decreases  percent changes in supply costs  and margins during the year ended december  and amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water operating revenues water supply costs water purchased power purchased for pumping groundwater production assessment water supply cost balancing accounts total water supply costs water margin percent margin water electric operating revenues electric supply costs power purchased for resale electric supply cost balancing accounts total electric supply costs electric margin percent margin electric as reported on awr s consolidated statements of income  except for supply cost balancing accounts 
the sum of water and electric supply cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on awr s consolidated statements of income and totaled  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
water and electric margins do not include any depreciation and amortization  maintenance expense  unrealized gains and losses on purchased power contracts or other operating expenses 
two of the principal factors affecting water supply costs and gross margin are the amount of water produced and the source of the water 
generally  the variable cost of producing water from wells is less than the cost of water purchased from wholesale suppliers 
in addition  gswc is authorized to establish water and electric supply cost balancing accounts for increases and or decreases in costs due to changes in rates charged by its suppliers which provide purchased water and purchased power  and by agencies assessing groundwater related pump taxes for water service areas in california 
higher or 
table of contents lower actual costs as compared to costs authorized by the cpuc will either be recovered from or refunded to customers in the future 
prior to november  changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s wells would increase decrease actual supply related costs relative to the mix approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
on august   the cpuc issued a final decision which approved the establishment of a modified cost balancing account that allows recovery of supply costs for changes in water supply mix 
gswc implemented the mcba in november prospectively in connection with the new conservation rate design and the implementation of a wram to decouple sales from revenues 
under the mcba  gswc began tracking adopted expense levels for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes  as established by the cpuc 
variances which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume between adopted and actual purchased water  purchased power  and pump tax expenses are recorded as a component of the supply cost balancing account provision  as the amount of such variances will be recovered from or refunded to gswc s customers at a later date 
this is reflected with an offsetting entry to a current asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for regions ii and iii 
for the year ended december   of gswc s water supply mix was purchased as compared to purchased for the year ended december  because the cost of water purchased is generally higher than pumped water from gswc s wells  this change in mix resulted in a slight improvement in water s percent margin prior to november compared to the same period in as noted above  in november gswc implemented the mcba for regions ii and iii which eliminates the effects of changes in the water supply mix prospectively 
purchased water costs for the year ended december  increased by to million as compared to million in the increase in purchased water due to higher water rates charged from wholesale suppliers was offset by lower customer usage and the slight favorable change in the supply mix discussed above 
in general  the supply cost balancing account as discussed above allows gswc to track incremental rate changes from suppliers for future recovery in water rates 
the favorable change in the supply mix allowed gswc to serve a portion of the customer demand from groundwater production rather than wholesale purchases  primarily because of the return to service or replacement of wells which had been removed from service in as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems 
for the year ended december   the decrease of in power purchased for pumping was principally due to lower customer demand  partially offset by a favorable change in the supply mix  as discussed above 
groundwater production assessments were higher by due to a favorable change in supply mix and increases in assessment rates pump tax rates levied against groundwater production  effective july and average pump tax rates increased in regions ii and iii by approximately and  respectively  between the two periods 
these increases in groundwater production assessments were partially offset by lower customer demand 
again  the supply cost balancing account and mcba tracks the increases in pump tax rates for future recovery in water rates 
the supply cost balancing account tracks differences between the current cost for supply items water  power  and pump taxes charged by gswc s suppliers and the cost for those items incorporated into gswc s rates 
over collections occur when the current cost of these items is less than the amount in rates which has the effect of increasing the supply cost balancing account in the statements of income 
under collections occur when the current cost exceeds the amount in rates for these items and  conversely  will have the effect of decreasing the supply cost balancing account in the statements of income 
typically  over collections or under collections  when they occur  are tracked in the supply cost balancing accounts for future refund or recovery through a surcredit in the event of an over collection or surcharge in the event of an under collection on customers bills 
once in rates  the amortization of surcharges that are in place to recover under collections from customers have the effect of increasing the supply cost balancing account and increasing revenues in the statements of income  resulting in no earnings impact 
conversely  the amortization of surcredits that are in rates to refund over collections to customers have the effect of decreasing the supply cost balancing account and decreasing revenues  also resulting in no earnings impact 
an increase of  in the water supply cost balancing account provision during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily caused by i a million increase in the amortization of the water supply cost balancing accounts for surcharges currently in effect  ii the recording of  in the mcba accounts effective november   and iii a  decrease in interest earned on the supply cost balancing accounts due to lower interest rates  offset by i a net increase totaling million of under collections in compared to the same period in  and ii the recording of a  net under collection adjustment relating to region iii s pre supply costs which were approved by the cpuc in may of  upon approval by the cpuc  a regulatory asset was established for these previously incurred supply costs 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bves division decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting 
table of contents primarily lower customer demand and kilowatt hour usage 
overall  electric s dollar margin decreased by  due to lower demand and a  decrease in interest earned on the electric supply cost balancing account due to lower interest rates  partially offset by an adjustment of  in resulting from bves low income program which reduced electric revenues  previously discussed 
unrealized gain loss on purchased power contracts unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represent gains and losses recorded for gswc s purchased power agreements with morgan stanley capital group  inc there was a million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the contract for unrealized gains and losses at bves terminated at december  we have filed an application with the cpuc to review our new purchased power contracts  effective after december   and intend to seek the cpuc s authorization of a memorandum account to track the changes in the fair market value of the contracts resulting in unrealized gains and losses 
if this application is approved  in future periods unrealized gains and losses on the new purchased power contracts will not impact earnings 
other operating expenses the primary components of other operating expenses include payroll  materials and supplies  chemicals and water treatment  and outside service costs of operating the regulated water systems  including the costs associated with water transmission and distribution  pumping  water quality  meter reading  billing  and operations of district offices 
registrant s electric and contracted services operations incur many of the same types of costs as well 
for the year ended december  and  other operating expenses by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total other operating expenses for the year ended december   other operating expenses for water services increased by million  or  due primarily to an increase i in labor costs of  due to higher wages and related benefits  and an overall increase in the number of employees  ii of  in bad debt expense due to current economic situation which is affecting customers across all water service areas  iii of  in outside legal and consulting services  and iv of  in gswc s water education program costs in connection with conservation  partially offset by a decrease of  due to lower water treatment and chemical costs  including the removal of nitrate and perchlorate at various groundwater treatment plants that occurred in  and a decrease of  in other expenses 
there was an increase of  in other operating expenses for electric services primarily due to higher wages and related benefits of  an increase of  in bad debt expense and an increase of  in other expenses 
contracted services experienced increases in other operating expenses of  primarily due to the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at military bases in north carolina and south carolina that began during the first quarter of as a result of these new bases  other operating expenses increased by million during the year ended december   including million in transition costs 
these increases were partially offset by decreases at the other military bases during resulting from lower outside services of million primarily paid to the subcontractor that provided wastewater services to certain of asus subsidiaries 
on january   asus and its subsidiaries agreed to buy out all current and future rights which this subcontractor had to provide wastewater services at any bases operated by asus and any of its present and or future subsidiaries 
for the year ended december   most of these services were performed internally at lower cost  some of which is recorded in labor costs within maintenance expense 
there was also a decrease of  in bad debt expense due to the reversal of previously recorded reserves resulting from collections of past due receivables from the us government  partially offset by an increase of  in other expenses 

table of contents administrative and general expenses administrative and general expenses include payroll related to administrative and general functions  all employee benefits charged to expense accounts  insurance expenses  outside legal and consulting fees  regulatory utility commission expenses  expenses associated with being a public company and general corporate expenses

there was an increase of million in contracted services administrative and general expenses due primarily to an increase of million associated with the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at military bases in north carolina and south carolina that began during the first quarter of  including allocations from asus headquarters and the general office headquarters 
there were also increases at the other bases including i an increase of approximately  in outside services for legal and consulting work  including costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition  previously discussed  ii an approximate  increase in labor and employee benefit costs  and iii a charge of  relating to the acquisition of the assets of a wastewater subcontractor and the related settlement of the preexisting relationship between asus and the wastewater subcontractor used by the military utility privatization subsidiaries in these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in other expenses 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  and  depreciation and amortization by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total depreciation and amortization 
table of contents for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense for water and electric services increased by million to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the approximately million of additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january there were also changes to the composite depreciation rates approved by the cpuc 
registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to ongoing construction at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
there was also an increase in depreciation and amortization expense for contracted services due to the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at military bases in north carolina and south carolina that began during the first quarter of as a result of these new bases  depreciation and amortization expense increased by  during the year ended december  there were also increases of approximately  at the other military bases and at asus corporate office due to the addition of fixed assets 
maintenance for the year ended december  and  maintenance expense by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total maintenance for the year ended december   maintenance expense for water services decreased by million to million compared to million for the year ended december  due principally to a decrease in emergency maintenance on gswc s wells and water supply sources in its region ii and iii service areas 
region ii and iii s maintenance expense decreased by million and  respectively 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of  in maintenance expense at region i 
there was also a decrease of  at ccwc 
there was an increase of  in maintenance for electric services related to the mw natural gas fueled generation plant 
there was an increase of million in contracted services maintenance expense due primarily to the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at military bases in north carolina and south carolina that began during the first quarter of  which added million in maintenance expense for the year ended december  the level of maintenance costs at these bases also reflects the age and condition of the infrastructure at these bases 
there was also increased maintenance expense of  at the other bases due primarily to higher internal labor costs as a result of the military utility privatization subsidiaries performing services directly that were formerly performed by a wastewater subcontractor 
as previously mentioned  in january  asus and its subsidiaries agreed to buy out all current and future rights which this subcontractor had to provide wastewater services at any bases operated by asus

property and other taxes were higher in contracted services due to the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at military bases in north carolina and south carolina that began during the first quarter of as a result of these new bases  property and other taxes increased by  during the year ended december  there was also an increase of  primarily in gross receipt taxes at the other military bases mostly related to the odus military bases in virginia due in part to an increase in gross revenues 
construction expenses for the year ended december   asus construction expenses increased to million compared to million for the same period in the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at military bases in north carolina and south carolina that began during the first quarter of added construction expenses of million during the year ended december   including  for emergency construction at psus to address pre existing conditions not anticipated in the contract and for which asus is pursuing recovery from the us government and  in anticipated losses associated with certain initial capital upgrade projects 
additional construction expenses of million at asus other subsidiaries during were offset by the wastewater expansion project at fort bliss  previously discussed 
for the year ended december   this project generated million in construction expenses 
the project was completed in august and did not recur in goodwill impairment charge during  a charge of million was recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 registrant tests goodwill annually for impairment at the reporting unit level  or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable 
registrant evaluates goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for reporting units with goodwill balances 
the realization of goodwill is dependent on expected future cash flows from the underlying operations 
forecasted revenues and capital expenditures  which include forecasted customer connection growth and the timing and amount of regulated rate increases  are key components of the discounted cash flow projections 
during the recent impairment analysis  registrant determined that revenue growth for its arizona utility  ccwc  was likely to be slower than originally projected due to downturns in overall economic conditions and new housing construction  as well as the current regulatory environment in arizona resulting in regulatory lags and lower than anticipated rate increases 
based on the recent goodwill impairment analysis  million of goodwill associated with ccwc was found to be impaired and was charged to expense during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents net gain on sale of property for the year ended december   water services recorded a net pretax gain of  on the sale of property primarily related to a gain of  relating to gswc s sale of a parcel of land to the los angeles unified school district for the purpose of constructing a high school 
there was also a pretax gain of  on the sale of property it owned in the city of claremont

table of contents there was an unrealized gain on purchased power contracts in due to increasing energy prices versus an unrealized loss on purchased power contracts in the cumulative unrealized gain on purchased power contracts increased pretax income by approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december   as compared to a cumulative unrealized loss on purchased power contracts that decreased pretax income by million  or per share in a decision issued by the cpuc on april  regarding the accounting treatment of gswc s water rights lease revenues  increased pretax operating income by about million in march  or approximately per share  when compared to the same period in pursuant to a march cpuc order  the apportionment of any folsom lease revenues that gswc may collect commencing in january was to be determined by a later decision 
pending that later decision and beginning in the first quarter of  all amounts billed to the city of folsom had been included in a regulatory liability account and no amounts were recognized as revenue until uncertainties about this matter were resolved with the cpuc 
on april   the cpuc authorized gswc to reinvest all lease revenues since january  inclusive of the balances in the regulatory liability accounts established by gswc for this matter  in water system infrastructure 
these investments will be included in the rate base upon which gswc earns a rate of return 
in accordance with california law  gswc has eight years in which to reinvest the proceeds  after which any amount remaining would inure to the customer s benefit 
as a result  in the first quarter of  gswc transferred about million of water rights lease revenues received from the city of folsom in and from the regulatory liability account  into water revenues 
there was an increase  excluding the million of water right lease revenues discussed above  in the margin for the water segment of million  or per share  as compared to the same period of due to increased water rates approved by the cpuc that were effective january   an increase in water consumption over that in the prior period  and a favorable supply mix change 
there was an increase in pretax operating income from contracted services at asus of million  or per share  as compared to the same period of for operating  maintaining and improving the water and wastewater systems at military bases for the us government 
the increases include revenue recognized for certain special projects under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
there was an increase in gswc s other operating and maintenance expenses of million  or per share  as compared to the same period of  resulting from higher chemical and water treatment costs along with an increase in required and emergency maintenance on gswc s wells and water supply sources 
higher other expenses primarily consisting of administrative and general expenses  a change in the effective income tax rate  as well as other items described below  contributed to an overall decrease of per basic share to the results of operations 
operating revenues water for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  contributing to this increase were rate increases approved by the cpuc effective january   which added approximately million in to water revenues 
included in the rate increases for were million for region ii and million to recover general office expenses allocated to region iii 
these increases were approved by the cpuc on november  and were retroactive to january  in addition  an increase of about in the volume of billed water consumption resulting from much warmer and drier weather conditions increased revenues by approximately million 
differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers  causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparable periods 
partially offsetting these increases was the fact that operating revenues for were positively impacted by a cpuc decision issued on april  enabling gswc to record million of water rights lease revenues from the city of folsom for the period from january to december prior to this decision  the apportionment of any lease revenues that gswc collected in and had been included in a regulatory liability account and no amounts were recognized as revenues until regulatory uncertainties about this matter were resolved 
there was no such adjustment in in addition  the increases in revenues are partially offset by the expiration in october of the surcharge that was in rates to recover region iii s under collection in supply costs 
this decrease in revenues is offset by a corresponding amount in the supply cost balancing accounts discussed below  resulting in no impact to pretax operating income 

table of contents electric for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to lower electric usage and the recording of a regulatory liability of approximately  with a corresponding decrease in revenues  for probable refunds to customers related to the construction of gswc s mw natural gas fueled generation plant 
contracted services revenues from contracted services are comprised of construction revenues and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems at military bases 
for the year ended december   revenues from contracted services increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to an increase of approximately million related to construction revenues earned from the us government and recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the revenues earned were for the construction of certain improvements  renewals and replacements to the existing water and wastewater infrastructure at fort bliss and at the military bases located in virginia and maryland pursuant to contracts entered into in certain of the construction projects are fixed price contracts and are supplements to asus year contracts with the us government 
in particular  asus entered into a million project for the construction of certain improvements to the existing wastewater infrastructure located at fort bliss 
the project was a firm fixed price contract and was an amendment and supplement to the year contract with the us government to manage the entire water and wastewater systems at fort bliss 
revenues from this agreement have been recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
as a result of this new project  which began in early  revenues for contracted services increased by million during the project was completed in august the year over year revenue increase resulting from this project was partially offset by the non recurrence of revenues for other one time construction projects that were completed in earnings and cash flows from amendments and modifications to the original year contracts with the us government are sporadic and may or may not continue in future periods 
there were also additional management fee revenues totaling  during generated from operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems under the military privatization contracts in virginia and maryland 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in management fees totaling  related to contracts with various municipalities to provide billing  call handling and meter reading services 
effective january   asus assigned these service contracts with the various municipalities to gswc 
these management fees are now earned by gswc so there was no impact on registrant s consolidated earnings as a result of this assignment 
registrant relies upon rate approvals by state regulatory agencies in california and arizona and price redeterminations and equitable adjustments by the us government in order to recover operating expenses and provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant 
without such adequate rate relief granted in a timely manner  operating revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted

however  this measure  which is not presented in accordance with gaap  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income  which is determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of operating performance 
total supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses 
supply costs accounted for approximately and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the table below provides the amount of increases decreases  percent changes in supply costs  and margins during the years ended december  and amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water operating revenues water supply costs water purchased power purchased for pumping groundwater production assessment water supply cost balancing accounts total water supply costs water margin percent margin water electric operating revenues electric supply costs power purchased for resale electric supply cost balancing accounts total electric supply costs electric margin percent margin electric as reported on awr s consolidated statements of income  except for supply cost balancing accounts 
the sum of water and electric supply cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on awr s consolidated statements of income and totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
water and electric margins do not include any depreciation and amortization  maintenance expense  unrealized gains and losses on purchased power contracts  or other operating expenses 
for the year ended december   of the company s water supply mix was purchased as compared to purchased for the year ended december  this change in mix resulted in improved margins in compared to the same period in water gross margin for the year ended december  included the million water rights 
table of contents lease revenues from the city of folsom 
without the million water rights lease revenues in  water gross margin for the year ended december  would have been 
purchased water costs for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to higher water rates charged by wholesale suppliers and higher customer consumption 
in general  the supply cost balancing account as discussed above allows gswc to track incremental rate changes from suppliers  for future recovery in water rates 
these increases in purchased water costs were offset by a favorable change in the supply mix discussed above 
the favorable change in supply mix allowed gswc to serve a portion of the increased customer demand from groundwater production rather than wholesale purchases  primarily because of the return to service or replacement of wells which had been removed from service in as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems 
for the year ended december   the increases in power purchased for pumping and groundwater production assessments were due to higher customer demand and an increase in pumping volume resulting from the favorable supply mix change as discussed 
there were also increases in assessment rates pump tax rates levied against groundwater production  effective july and average pump tax rates increased in region ii and iii by approximately and  respectively 
again  the supply cost balancing account tracks the increases in pump tax rates for future recovery in water rates 
a decrease of  during in the water supply cost balancing account provision as compared to was primarily caused by a million decrease due to the expiration in october of the surcharge that was in rates to recover previously incurred supply costs in gswc s region iii service areas 
this decrease was partially offset by an overall increase of million in the provision as compared to the same period of on november   the cpuc approved general rate case increases  retroactive to january   for gswc s region ii service area 
the decision reflects the revenue requirement for supply costs that included recent rate increases from gswc s suppliers 
as a result  there was less under collection in supply costs to record as compared to  resulting in an increase to the supply cost balancing account as discussed 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bves division decreased slightly by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting primarily lower customer demand and kilowatt hour usage 
unrealized gain loss on purchased power contracts unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represent gains and losses recorded for gswc s purchased power agreements with pinnacle west marketing trading company  llc pwmt formerly pinnacle west capital corporation  which qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
in june  pwmt sold many of its wholesale power contracts to morgan stanley capital group  inc mscg 
the sale included the contract between pwmt and gswc 
gswc was notified by pwmt about the sale of its contracts  and in september an assignment agreement was executed by gswc  pwmt and mscg that became effective november  the assignment agreement retained the identical terms and conditions of the original contract 
the million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  is due to an increase in the forward market prices at december  since december  there was a million pretax unrealized loss on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  unrealized gains and losses at bves will continue to impact earnings positively or negatively during the life of the contract  which terminates at the end of as of december   there is an accumulated unrealized loss of million which will be recognized in income by december  
table of contents other operating expenses the components of other operating expenses include primarily payroll  materials and supplies  chemicals and water treatment  and contract service costs of operating the regulated water systems  including the costs associated with water transmission and distribution  pumping  water quality  meter reading  billing  and operations of district offices

region ii incurred additional costs primarily for the removal of arsenic and volatile organic compounds at six of its wells  while region iii incurred additional costs primarily for two of its treatment plants 
there was also an increase in labor costs of  due to higher wages and related benefits  and an increase of  in conservation costs at gswc s region ii service area 
in  gswc began expensing conservation costs in region ii pursuant to an agreement reached with the cpuc during its general rate case 
some of the region ii conservation expenses were recovered in rates 
previously  conservation costs in region ii were capitalized and recovered in rate base 
these expense increases in were offset  in part  by a decrease of  in bad debt expense 
there was also an increase in other operating expenses of million for contracted services primarily due to the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at military bases in maryland and virginia 
asus operated these bases during the full year ended december   whereas  with service commencement dates in the first four months of  they were only operated by asus during part of other operating expenses increased by approximately  at these bases

these increases were offset by a decrease of  in pension costs as a result of favorable changes to actuarial assumptions 
there was also an increase of million in contracted services administrative and general expenses due primarily to i the recovery in of transition period operating expenses of about  at the various military bases pursuant to the contracts with the us government  there was no such recovery in  ii an increase of approximately  in outside services including legal and consulting costs  iii an approximate  increase in labor and employee benefit costs  and iv an increase of  in allocation from the corporate headquarters to the military utility privatization subsidiaries 
a final decision on the general rate case for gswc s region ii and the application to cover general office expenses allocated to regions ii and iii were approved on november  and imposed an increased allocation of corporate headquarters expenses to contracted services 
this adjustment was retroactive to january  and was made in the fourth quarter of  thus negatively impacting contracted services pretax income and positively impacting water and electric services pretax income by the same amount 
depreciation and amortization for the years ended december  and  depreciation and amortization by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense for water and electric services increased by million to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the effects of closing approximately million of additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
there was also an increase in depreciation and amortization expense for contracted services due to the addition of fixed assets 

table of contents maintenance for the years ended december  and  maintenance expense by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total maintenance for the year ended december   maintenance expense for water services increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due principally to an increase in planned and emergency maintenance on gswc s water supply and distribution facilities 
a significantly higher than anticipated number of water main repairs were completed during  many of which were attributed to much colder than average temperatures reacting with the cast iron pipe materials in older sections of gswc s distribution system 
in january  gswc s largest distribution system in los angeles county experienced over leaks due to the colder than normal temperatures 
in addition to the increase in repairs to the distribution systems owned by gswc  an increased effort in was focused on planned maintenance of fire hydrants  gate valves and flushing dead end water lines compared to gswc also experienced an increase in planned and unplanned maintenance of its water supply sources  namely company owned wells 
many planned well treatment and rehabilitation projects were deferred in due to unanticipated water quality and mechanical problems in many wells discussed above 
in  a number of new wells and treatment facilities were placed into service allowing gswc to continue with the well maintenance projects originally scheduled for without experiencing a decline in groundwater production 
in general  well and pump maintenance expenses continue to increase due to rising labor and material costs and more stringent water discharge requirements 
these maintenance increases are included in each general rate case and are generally recovered in rates 
however  amounts included in each general rate case are estimated for future years and overages from those estimates may not be covered in rates 
there was an increase of  in maintenance for electric services related to the mw natural gas fueled generation plant 
there was also an increase of  in contracted services maintenance expense due primarily to increases at fort bliss 
property and other taxes for the years ended december  and  property and other taxes by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total property and other taxes for the year ended december   overall property and other taxes increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting additional property taxes resulting from higher assessed values  and increases in payroll taxes based on increased labor costs

as previously mentioned  asus entered into a million project for the construction of certain improvements to the existing wastewater infrastructure located at fort bliss 
as a result of this new project  construction expenses increased by million during the project was completed in august the increase in construction expenses because of this project was partially offset by other non recurring construction projects that were completed in net gain on sale of property for the year ended december   water services recorded a net pretax gain of  on the sale of property 
this gain includes a settlement of  reached with the los angeles unified school district in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land for the purpose of constructing a high school 
this parcel of land had not been used for a number of years in gswc s public utility operations 
in addition  there was a gain of  related to the sale of property in the city of claremont
