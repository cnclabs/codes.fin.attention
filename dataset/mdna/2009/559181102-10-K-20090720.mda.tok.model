change in fiscal year end prior to fiscal  we had a week fiscal year ending on the first sunday subsequent to march on january   our board of directors approved a change of fiscal year from a fiscal year ending on the first sunday subsequent to march to a fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to april except for any given year in which april is a sunday  in which case the fiscal year will end on april  starting with fiscal our fiscal years consist of four quarters of weeks each except for each fifth or sixth fiscal year  which includes one quarter with weeks 
our fiscal year began on may  and ended on may   resulting in a one month transition period that began on april  and ended on may  information for the transition period was included in the quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended august   which was filed with the sec on september  the separate audited financial statements required for the transition period are included in item of this form k 
references in this form k to fiscal represent the weeks ended may  references in this form k to fiscal represent the weeks ended  april  we have not submitted financial information for the weeks ended april  in this form k because the information is not practical or cost effective to prepare 
we believe that the weeks of fiscal provides a meaningful comparison to the weeks of fiscal presented in this form k 
we do not believe that there are any significant factors  seasonal or otherwise  that would impact the comparability of information or trends if results for the weeks ended april  were presented in lieu of results for the weeks ended may  we did not experience any unusual amount of business activity or product shipment in the transition month and have reported the loss incurred in that month in our consolidated statements of operations in item of this form k 
accordingly  we have not included the results of the one month transition period that began on april  and ended on may  in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary we provide eda software products and related services 
our software enables chip designers to reduce the time it takes to design and produce complex integrated circuits used in the communications  computing  consumer electronics  networking and semiconductor industries 
our products are used in all major phases of the chip development cycle  from initial design through physical implementation 
our focus is on software used to design the most technologically advanced integrated circuits  specifically those with minimum feature sizes of micron and smaller 
see item  business for a more complete description of our business 
as an eda software provider  we generate substantially all our revenue from the semiconductor and electronics industries 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services out of their research and development r d budgets 
as a result  our revenue is heavily influenced by our customers long term business outlook and willingness to invest in new chip designs 

table of contents the semiconductor industry is highly volatile and cost sensitive 
our customers focus on controlling costs and reducing risk  lowering r d expenditures  cutting back on design starts  purchasing from fewer suppliers  and requiring more favorable pricing and payment terms from suppliers 
in addition  intense competition among suppliers of eda products has resulted in pricing pressure on eda products 
to support our customers  we have focused on providing technologically advanced products to address each step in the ic design process  as well as integrating these products into broad platforms  and expanding our product offerings 
our goal is to be the eda technology supplier of choice for our customers as they pursue longer term  broader and more flexible relationships with fewer suppliers 
our accomplishments during fiscal include deployment and adoption of talus  our platform for design implementation  by our major customers 
qualification of the talus and quartz products for nanometer process technology in taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company s tsmc reference flow qualifying for the reference flow removes barrier for tsmc customers to adopt the magma tools 
titan  our platform for analog mixed signal design  was recognized by design automation conference attendees in voting for best overall new product at the trade show 
titan and hydra were named to edn magazine s hot electronic products of below is a summary of our operations for fiscal revenue for fiscal was million  a decrease of from the prior year 
licenses and bundled licenses and services sales for fiscal and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenue 
for fiscal  of our revenue was derived from orders recognized on a ratable basis or due and payable or cash receipts basis 
for fiscal  of our revenue was derived from short term time based and perpetual licenses recognized up front of which of our revenue was from new contracts entered into during fiscal and the remaining of our revenue from orders received prior to fiscal but recognized as revenue in fiscal 
domestic sales revenue decreased by million or in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily a result of our customers experiencing continued end market softness in demand for their products and reduced visibility in forecasting their business 
the number of our employees decreased to as of may   down from  as of april  most of the decrease in employees represents reductions to our research and development and sales and marketing organizations 
for fiscal  cash flows used in operations were million  or of fiscal revenue  and included a million one time payment on synopsys litigation settlement 
global markets recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through fiscal continued concerns about the global financial and banking system  systemic impact of inflation or deflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy generally 
these concerns  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have recently contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
in particular  the semiconductor industry continues to be materially adversely affected by the macroeconomic environment 

table of contents as a result of these market conditions  the availability and cost of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the financial markets has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the us and global markets and economies has adversely affected our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers 
if these market conditions continue  they may continue to limit our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
recent acquisitions in fiscal  we did not acquire any companies and did not make any material asset purchases 
during fiscal  we acquired companies and purchased technologies that enable us to expand into new markets 
we believe that these acquisitions will be a significant factor in our ability to compete successfully in the eda industry and we expect to make similar acquisitions in the future 
these acquisitions have increased the number of our employees and  as a result  increased our research and development and sales and marketing expenses 
on february   we acquired sabio labs  inc  a privately held developer of analog design solutions for mixed signal designers 
sabio s software enables designers to create robust analog designs  port complex circuits to new process technologies in foundries efficiently  and explore system design trade offs early in the design process 
the total purchase price for the acquisition was million  consisting of approximately  shares of our common stock valued at million and transaction costs of  as part of the initial consideration   shares of our common stock valued at million was associated with employee retention and is being earned and recorded as compensation expenses in accordance with such employees vesting schedules 
in addition  we agreed to pay up to million of contingent consideration in the form of cash or shares of magma common stock  at our discretion  to the former sabio stockholders upon achieving certain product integration and booking milestones 
on september   we acquired rio design automation  inc  a privately held eda software company that provides package aware chip design software 
rio s software enables designers to analyze and optimize integrated circuit design within the context of the package and electronic system  further expanding our product offering 
prior to acquiring rio  we had an ownership interest in rio 
the total purchase price for the step acquisition was million  consisting of  in cash  approximately  shares of our common stock valued at million  and transaction costs of  on april   we acquired certain assets from a privately held developer of eda technology 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  we paid total consideration of  in cash 
based on management s estimates and appraisal  the  consideration was allocated to patents and intellectual property 
during fiscal  a total of million in gross contingent cash consideration and a total of million in gross contingent stock consideration were earned by various acquired businesses upon their achievement of certain milestones under various prior asset purchase and business combination agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the most significant potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we consider the following accounting policies related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  cash 
table of contents equivalent  short term and long term investments  strategic investments  asset purchases and business combinations  valuation of long lived assets and income taxes to be our most critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  as modified by sop  which generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is specific to us 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for each element of a license arrangement and maintenance is the only undelivered element  then all revenue for the license arrangement is recognized over the term of the agreement 
if evidence of fair value does exist for the elements that have not been delivered  but does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which recognition of revenue for the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual license fee is recognized as revenue immediately 
our revenue recognition policy is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
management has made significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products referred to as an arrangement in the accounting literature we must evaluate whether our fee is fixed or determinable and we must assess whether collectability is probable 
these judgments are discussed below 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
with respect to each arrangement  we must make a judgment as to whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
if the fee is fixed or determinable  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of software assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  then the revenue is recognized when customer installments are due and payable 
in order for an arrangement to be considered to have fixed or determinable fees  of the license  services and initial post contract support fee is to be paid within one year or less from the order date 
we have a history of collecting fees on such arrangements according to contractual terms 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond twelve months are considered not to be fixed or determinable 
collectability is probable 
in order to recognize revenue  we must make a judgment about the collectability of the arrangement fee 
our judgment of the collectability is applied on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial positions and ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectability is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash receipts basis as each payment is collected 
licenses revenue and bundled licenses and services revenue we derive license revenue primarily from licenses of our design and implementation software and  to a lesser extent  from licenses of our analysis and verification products 
we license our products under time based and perpetual licenses whereby license revenue is recognized after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the product to the customer  provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is probable and there are no remaining obligations other than maintenance 
for perpetual licenses and unbundled time based license arrangements  where maintenance is included for the first period of the license term  with maintenance thereafter renewable by the customer at the substantive rates stated in their agreements with us  the stated rate for maintenance renewal is vendor specific objective 
table of contents evidence vsoe of the fair value of maintenance in these arrangements 
for these arrangements license revenue is recognized using the residual method in the period in which the license agreement is executed assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
where an arrangement involves extended payment terms  revenue recognized using the residual method is limited to amounts due and payable 
for transactions that include bundled maintenance for the entire license term we have no vsoe of fair value of maintenance 
therefore  we recognize license revenue ratably over the maintenance period 
if an arrangement involves extended payment terms that is  where payment for less than of the arrangement fee is due within one year of the contract date we recognize revenue to the extent of the lesser of the amount due and payable or the ratable portion 
we classify the revenue recognized from these transactions separately as bundled licenses and services revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized over time as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
services revenue we derive services revenue primarily from consulting and training for our software products and from maintenance fees for our products 
most of our license agreements include maintenance  generally for a one year period  renewable annually 
services revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance term 
because we have vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services  revenue is recognized as these services are performed or completed 
our consulting and training services are generally not essential to the functionality of the software 
our products are fully functional upon delivery of the product 
additional factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include  but are not limited to degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on our ability to recognize the software license fee 
stock based compensation effective april   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  over the vesting period of the award 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires the input of various highly subjective assumptions  including expected future stock price volatility  expected term of instruments and expected forfeiture rates 
we established the expected term for employee options and awards  as well as forfeiture rates  based on the historical settlement experience  while giving consideration to vesting schedules and to options that have estimated life cycles less than the contractual terms 
assumptions for option exercises and pre vesting terminations of options were stratified for employee groups with sufficiently distinct behavior patterns 
expected future stock price volatility was developed based on the average of our historical weekly stock price volatility and average implied volatility 
these input factors are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
unbilled accounts receivable unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue that has been recognized in advance of being invoiced to the customer 
in all cases  the revenue and unbilled receivables are for contracts which are non cancelable  in which there are no contingencies and where the customer has taken delivery of both the software and the encryption key 
table of contents required to operate the software 
we typically generate invoices days in advance of contractual due dates  and we invoice the entire amount of the unbilled accounts receivable within one year from the contract inception 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate using the factors described above 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration in any one customer  industry or geographic region 
as of may   one of our customers accounted for more than of total receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
if actual losses are significantly greater than the allowance we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reported net loss 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our allowance  this would decrease our general and administrative expenses and our reported net income would increase 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period 
the election  called the fair value option  enables entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal our adoption of sfas permits us to elect to carry certain financial instruments at fair value with corresponding changes in fair value reported in the results of operations 
the election to carry an instrument at fair value is made at the individual contract level and can be made only at origination or inception of the instrument  or upon the occurrence of an event that results in a new basis of accounting 
our election is on a prospective basis and is irrevocable 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we elected fair value accounting for the purchased put option recorded in connection with the settlement agreement signed with ubs financial services  inc ubs 
this election was made in order to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by accounting for the purchased put option and underlying auction rate securities ars under different methods 
the initial election of fair value led to a million gain included in other income expense  net with the purchased put option asset recorded in long term investments for the three months ended november  during the third fiscal quarter  the company recorded a loss of million on the ars due to the third quarter valuation 
in addition  the company recorded a gain due to the increase in the valuation of the put option by million 
for the fiscal year ended may  a total net gain on the put option of million was reported in valuation gain loss in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal  and million was reported as a loss on the ars in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 
table of contents cash equivalent  short term investments and long term investments we account for our investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these investments are typically classified as available for sale  and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value as of the balance sheet date  with gains or losses considered to be temporary in nature reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss within the stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of may   investments in ars have been classified as trading  and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value as of the balance sheet date  with gains or losses recorded as other income or expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value and establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
long term investments on the consolidated balance sheets consist of ars that are aaa rated and are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state regulated higher education agencies and reinsured by the us department of education  and the ubs purchased put option 
historically  liquidity for investors in ars was provided via an auction process that reset the applicable interest rate generally every days  allowing investors to either roll over their investments or sell them at par 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  there was insufficient demand for these types of investments during the auctions and  as a result  these securities are not currently liquid 
in october  we entered into an agreement with ubs which provides us with auction rate securities rights rights to sell our ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period june  through july  these rights are a separate freestanding instrument accounted for separately from the ars  and are registered  nontransferable securities accounted for as a purchased put option initially recorded at fair value 
under the rights agreement  ubs may  at its discretion  sell the ars at any time through july  without prior notice to us and must pay us par value for the ars within one day of the sale transaction settlement 
additionally  ubs offered a no net cost loan to us of up to of the market value of the ars as determined by ubs until june  due to our entering into this agreement with ubs and enabling ubs to sell the ars at any time  the ars previously reported as available for sale have been transferred to trading securities 
as of may   there was insufficient observable market information available to determine the fair value of our ars 
prior to november   we estimated level fair values for these securities based on the investment bank s valuations 
the investment bank valued student loan ars as floating rate notes with three pricing inputs the coupon  the current discount margin or spread  and the maturity 
the coupon was generally assumed to equal the maximum rate allowed under the terms of the instrument  the current discount margin was based on an assessment of observable yields on instruments bearing comparable risks  and the maturity was based on an assessment of the terms of the underlying instrument and the potential for restructuring the ars 
the primary unobservable input to the valuation was the maturity assumption which was set at five years for the majority of ars instruments 
through january   the ars were valued at par value due to the frequent resets that historically occurred through the auction process 
as of may   we engaged a third party valuation service to model level fair value using an income approach 
we reviewed the methodologies employed by the third party models 
this included a review of all relevant data inputs and the appropriateness of key model assumptions 
the pricing assumptions for the ars included the coupon rate  the estimated time to liquidity  current market rates for publicly traded corporate debt of similar credit rating and an adjustment for lack of liquidity 
the coupon rate was assumed to equal the stated maximum auction rate being received  which is determined based on 
table of contents the applicable day us treasury rate plus premium according to provisions outlined in each security s agreement 
the estimated time to liquidity was years based on i expectations from industry brokers for liquidity in the market and ii the period over which ubs and other broker dealers that had issued ars have agreed to redeem certain ars at par value 
the rights are a form of purchased put option that gives us the right to sell the ars to ubs for a price equal to par value during the period june  to july   providing liquidity for the ars sooner than the originally estimated years 
as we plan to exercise the rights on or around june   the value of the rights lies in i the ability to sell the securities thereby creating liquidity approximately years before the ars market is expected to become liquid and ii the avoidance of receiving below market coupon rate while the security is illiquid and auctions are failing 
the fair value of the rights represents the difference between the ars with an estimated time to liquidity of years and the ars with an estimated time to liquidity of years as the rights allow for the acceleration of liquidity and the avoidance of a below market coupon rate over the two year time period 
based on the level valuation and the transfer of the ars from the available for sale category to the trading category  we recorded an other than temporary loss of million in valuation gain loss  net  in the second quarter of including the transfer of accumulated temporary losses of million from other comprehensive loss previously recorded as a component of stockholder equity 
total other than temporary impairment loss of million was reported in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal accounting for asset purchases and business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired assets and business combinations to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the value of intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  acquired workforce and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  which could result in changes in the purchase price allocation 
goodwill impairment sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of the reporting units 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit see note to our consolidated financial statements in item 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining 
table of contents appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting units 
any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
sfas provides for a two step approach to determining whether and by how much goodwill has been impaired 
the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the company reporting unit to its net book value 
if the fair value is greater  then no impairment is deemed to have occurred 
if the fair value is less  then the second step must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of actual impairment 
to determine the fair value  our review process includes the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates  including the following for the reporting unit revenue  based on assumed market growth rates and our assumed market share  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of market segment growth  market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
we also considered its market capitalization on the dates of its impairment tests in determining the fair value of our business 
we completed the first step analysis during the second quarter of fiscal and determined that the fair value of our reporting units was in excess of the net book value on that date 
we conduct an annual goodwill impairment test at december accordingly we conducted this test during the third quarter and concluded that events had occurred and circumstances had changed during the third fiscal quarter of fiscal which showed the existence of impairment indicators  including a significant decline in our stock price and continued deterioration in the eda software products market and the related impact on our revenue forecasts 
consistent with our approach in our annual impairment testing  in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit  we considered both the market approach and income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices and the number of shares outstanding of our common stock 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
at december   we determined that the fair value of our reporting units was less than the net book value of the net assets of the reporting unit and accordingly  we performed step two of the impairment test 
in step two of the impairment test  we determined the implied fair value of the goodwill and compared it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  we allocated the fair value of the reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
our step two analysis resulted in a reduction in fair value of goodwill  and therefore  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal we performed the step one analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that the fair value of our reporting units was in excess of the net book value as of may  valuation of intangibles and long lived assets our intangible assets include acquired intangibles  excluding goodwill 
acquired intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products and technologies original lives assigned are one to six years 
we review our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be held and used  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if it is 
table of contents determined that an asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
based on our review  no impairment is indicated 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the amount of income taxes we pay could be subject to audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities  which could result in proposed assessments 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these tax matters will not be different from what was reflected in our historical income tax provisions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities as well as federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that the recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
as of may   we believe a valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets is required 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
future reversals or increases to our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
on april   we adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more likely than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
strategic investments in privately held companies our strategic equity investments consist of preferred stock and convertible notes that are convertible into preferred or common stock of several privately held companies 
the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic equity investments totaled million at may  our ability to recover our investments in private  non marketable equity securities and convertible notes and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute on their business plans and how well their products are accepted  as well as their ability to obtain additional capital funding to continue operations 
under our accounting policy  the carrying value of a non marketable investment is the amount paid for the investment unless it has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its estimated fair value 
for equity investments where our ownership interest is between to  or where we can exercise significant influence on the investee s operating or financial decisions  we record our share of net equity income loss of the investee based on our proportionate ownership 
during the first quarter of fiscal we made an additional investment in zerosoft  inc of million which increased our ownership in that company to as of may  we also invested million in helic inc during the first quarter of fiscal  bringing our ownership in helic to as of may  in addition  one of our officers is a member of the board of directors of helic  which permits us to exercise significant influence on helic s operating decisions 
we have recorded our share of net equity income loss on 
table of contents these investments based on our proportionate ownership in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  with the purchase of the remaining ownership of one of our equity investments  rio design automation  inc  we ceased accounting for our investment in rio under the equity method and began accounting for our ownership on a consolidated basis 
the equity investment balance of  on the acquisition date was reclassified from other assets and was allocated to the book value of the previously owned assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded million of net loss on our equity investments during fiscal we review all of our investments periodically for impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the fair value analysis requires significant judgment 
this analysis includes assessment of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise  such as when we hold contractual rights that give us a preference over the rights of other investors 
as the equity markets have experienced volatility over the past few years  we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities 
if equity market conditions do not improve  as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds  the funds may not be available to them  or they may receive lower valuations  with more onerous investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments will likely become impaired 
however  we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future  or the extent or timing of individual impairments 
we recorded impairment charges related to these non marketable equity investments of million in the first fiscal quarter ended august  we did not record impairment charges related to these non marketable equity investments in fiscal and results of operations revenue overview revenue is comprised of licenses revenue  bundled licenses and services revenue  and services revenue 
licenses revenue consists of fees for time based or perpetual licenses of our software products 
bundled licenses and services revenue consists of fees for software licenses and post contract customer support pcs where we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of pcs 
services revenue consists of fees for services  such as customer training  consulting and pcs associated with licenses where we have established vsoe to account for services separately 
we recognize revenue based on the specific terms and conditions of the license contracts with our customer for our products and services as described in detail above under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates 
in our consolidated financial statements  we classify our license arrangements as either bundled or unbundled 
bundled license contracts include maintenance with the license fee and do not include optional maintenance periods 
unbundled license contracts have separate maintenance fees and include optional maintenance periods 
the company offers various contractual terms to its customers in designing license agreements to accommodate customer preferences  which are unrelated to product performance and service requirements  order volume  or pricing 
the contractual terms that result in the recognition of bundled licenses and services revenue are subject to customer preferences and have historically been inconsistently elected by customers 
moreover  revenue from existing long term contracts frequently shifts between revenue categories  with no change in the aggregate revenues recognized from such contracts 
in light of the foregoing  the company has concluded that changes in results of the bundled licenses and services revenue category generally do not indicate a material trend in the company s historical or future performance and therefore are not discussed below 
for management reporting and analysis purposes we classify our revenue as either licenses or services 
bundled licenses and services are divided into their component parts and included with either licenses or services for management analysis 

table of contents licenses revenue is divided into the following categories ratable due payable up front cash receipts services revenue is analyzed separately from the licenses revenue portion 
we use these classifications of revenue to provide greater insight into the reporting and monitoring of trends in the components of our revenue and to assist us in managing our business 
the characterization of an individual contract may change over time 
for example  a contract originally characterized as ratable may be redefined as cash receipts if that customer has difficulty in making payments in a timely fashion 
in cases where a contract has been re characterized for management reporting and analysis purposes  prior periods are not restated to reflect that change 
licenses revenue ratable 
for bundled time based licenses  we recognize license revenue ratably over the contract term  or as customer payments become due and payable  if less 
in our statements of operations the revenue for these bundled arrangements for both license and service is classified as bundled licenses and services 
for management reporting and analysis purposes we separate the licenses portion from the services portion of the revenue 
for unbundled time based licenses  we recognize license revenue ratably over the license term 
we generally refer to these licenses as ratable and we generally refer to all time based licenses recognized on a ratable basis as long term  independent of the actual length of term of the license 
due payable 
for unbundled time based licenses where the payment terms extend greater than one year from the arrangement effective date  we recognize license revenue on a due and payable basis 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we generally refer to this type of license as due payable 
up front 
for unbundled time based and perpetual licenses  we recognize license revenue upon shipment if the payment terms require the customer to pay of the license fee and the initial period of pcs within one year from the agreement date and payments are generally linear 
in all of these cases  the contracts are non cancelable  and the customer has taken delivery of both the software and the encryption key required to operate the software 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we generally refer to this type of license as up front  where the license is either perpetual or time based 
cash receipts 
we recognize revenue from customers who have not met our predetermined credit criteria on a cash receipts basis to the extent that revenue has otherwise been earned 
we recognize license revenue as we receive cash payments from these customers 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to this type of license revenue as cash receipts 
our license revenue in any given quarter depends upon the mix and volume of perpetual or short term licenses ordered during the quarter and the amount of long term ratable  due payable  and cash receipts license revenue recognized during the quarter 
in general  we refer to license revenue recognized from perpetual or time based licenses during the quarter as up front revenue  for management reporting and analysis purposes 
all other types of revenue are generally referred to as revenue from backlog 
we set our revenue targets for any given period based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain level of orders and a certain mix of short term licenses 
the precise mix of orders fluctuates substantially from period to period and affects the revenue we recognize in the period 
if we achieve our target level of total orders but are unable to achieve our target license mix  we may not meet our revenue targets if we have more than expected long term licenses or 
table of contents may exceed them if we have more than expected short term or perpetual licenses 
if we achieve the target license mix but the overall level of orders is below the target level  then we also may not meet our revenue targets as described in the risk factors in item a of this form k 
services revenue services revenue is primarily from consulting and training for our software products and from maintenance fees for our products 
most of our license agreements include maintenance  generally for a one year period  renewable annually 
services revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
because we have vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services  revenue is recognized as these services are performed or completed

long term investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets consist of ars that are aaa rated and are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state regulated higher education agencies and reinsured by the us department of education and the ubs rights described in the following paragraph 
historically  liquidity for investors in ars was provided via an auction process that reset the applicable interest rate generally every days  allowing investors to either roll over their investments or sell them at par 
beginning in fourth quarter of fiscal  there was insufficient demand for these types of investments during the auctions and  as a result  these securities are not currently liquid 
in october  we entered into an agreement with ubs which provides us with auction rate securities rights rights to sell our ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period june  through july  these rights are a separate freestanding instrument accounted for separately from the ars  and are registered  nontransferable securities accounted for as a purchased put option initially recorded at fair value 
under the rights agreement  ubs may  at its discretion  sell the ars at any time through july  without prior notice to us and must pay us par value for the ars within one day of the sale transaction settlement 
additionally  ubs offered a no net cost loan to us of up to of the market value of the ars as determined by ubs until june  due to our entering into this agreement with ubs and enabling ubs to sell the ars at any time  the ars previously reported as available for sale have been transferred to trading securities 
as of may   there was insufficient observable market information available to determine the fair value of our ars 
prior to november   we estimated level fair values for these securities based on the investment bank s valuations 
the investment bank valued student loan ars as floating rate notes with three pricing inputs the coupon  the current discount margin or spread  and the maturity 
the coupon was generally assumed to equal the maximum rate allowed under the terms of the instrument  the current discount margin was based on an assessment of observable yields on instruments bearing comparable risks  and the maturity was based on an assessment of the terms of the underlying instrument and the potential for restructuring the ars 
the primary unobservable input to the valuation was the maturity assumption which was set at five years for the majority of ars instruments 
through january   the ars were valued at par value due to the frequent resets that historically occurred through the auction process 
as of may   we engaged a third party valuation service to model level fair value using an income approach 
we reviewed the methodologies employed by the third party models 
this included a review of all relevant data inputs and the appropriateness of key model assumptions 
the pricing assumptions for the ars included the coupon rate  the estimated time to liquidity  current market rates for publicly traded corporate debt of similar credit rating and an adjustment for lack of liquidity 
the coupon rate was assumed to equal the stated maximum auction rate being received  which is determined based on the applicable day us treasury rate plus premium according to provisions outlined in each security s agreement 
the estimated time to liquidity was years based on i expectations from industry brokers for liquidity in the market and ii the period over which ubs and other broker dealers that had issued ars have agreed to redeem certain ars at par value 

table of contents the rights are a form of purchased put option that gives us the right to sell the ars to ubs for a price equal to par value during the period june  to july   providing liquidity for the ars sooner than the originally estimated years 
as we plan to exercise the rights on or around june   the value of the rights lies in i the ability to sell the securities thereby creating liquidity approximately years before the ars market is expected to become liquid and ii the avoidance of receiving below market coupon rate while the security is illiquid and auctions are failing 
the fair value of the rights represents the difference between the ars with an estimated time to liquidity of years and the ars with an estimated time to liquidity of years  as the rights allow for the acceleration of liquidity and the avoidance of a below market coupon rate over the two year time period 
based on the level valuation and the transfer of the ars from the available for sale category to the trading category  we recorded an other than temporary loss of million in valuation gain loss  net in the second quarter of including the transfer of accumulated temporary losses of million from other comprehensive loss previously recorded as a component of stockholder equity

the decrease in cash from customers was due to the lower revenues  while cost and expenses decreased due to the reduction in force and the closure of various facilities as part of our fiscal restructuring plan

in addition  we experienced a significant decline in revenues during fiscal we do not currently have the financing in place to pay the million of the notes maturing may   although as further discussed below  we are exploring opportunities to restructure our debt through a note exchange 
given the current adverse economic conditions generally  and in the semiconductor industry in particular  the credit market crisis and our own liquidity position  we have increased our focus on cash management and identifying and taking actions to sustain and enhance our liquidity position 
these actions include operational expense reduction initiatives and re timing or eliminating certain capital spending or research and development projects 
in the event the proposed note exchange offer described below is not successful  we may not have sufficient cash for our working capital requirements  capital investments  debt service and operations during the next twelve months and will not have sufficient cash to repay any remainder of the million of the notes maturing in may 
table of contents our ability to fund our cash needs over the short and long term will also depend on our ability to generate cash from operations  which is subject to general economic and financial market conditions  competition and other factors 
it could be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all  due to our financial condition  and current credit market conditions may make external financing difficult to obtain 
any external credit financing that we are able to obtain may contain terms that are not as favorable to us as historical financings 
we may try to obtain additional financing by means that could dilute our existing stockholders 
if the proposed note exchange offer described below is successful  we believe we will have sufficient capital resources to fund our working capital requirements  capital investments  debt service and operations during the next twelve months 
if the proposed note exchange offer is not successful and we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
any of these factors could have a materially adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for a complete discussion of the risks facing our business  including our liquidity  please see item a risk factors 
in recent years  we have funded our operations primarily through operating cash flows and through the issuance of convertible debt and equity securities 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we began implementing cost reduction measures which continued through the end of fiscal additionally  we have taken action to receive liquidity from our million in auction rate securities ars  which have been illiquid since february we entered into a settlement agreement with ubs financial services  inc ubs which allows us to recover the par value of the ars on or about june  see note 
concurrently  we entered into a no net cost secured line of credit with ubs offered as part of the total settlement agreement see note 
this secured line of credit provided us with cash of million until the ars can be sold back to ubs at par value in note exchange offer on may   we filed a schedule to and registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec to exchange the outstanding notes for a new series of convertible senior notes due new notes 
we filed amendments to both the schedule to and the registration statement with the sec on june  the schedule to and registration statement are currently being reviewed by the sec  and we plan to commence the exchange offer shortly after the filing of this form k 
there is no assurance the sec will declare the registration statement for the exchange offer effective or that the proposed exchange offer will be completed 
unless at least of the holders of the notes agree to participate in the exchange offer  we may not have sufficient cash to repay the notes that become due in may the uncertainty around the ultimate participation in the exchange offer raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern

the repurchased shares are to be used for general corporate purposes 
contractual obligations as of may   our principal contractual obligations consisted of million from fiscal through fiscal for office facilities  repayments of million of the notes due in may  and million in capital lease obligations for computer equipment and purchase obligations 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we do not anticipate an increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments with cost reduction plans that were initiated in fiscal purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the normal course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of may  although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
in addition  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
our acquisition agreements related to certain business combination and asset purchase transactions obligate us to pay certain contingent cash consideration based on meeting certain financial or project milestones and continued employment of certain employees 
the total amount of cash contingent consideration that could be paid under our acquisition agreements  assuming all contingencies are met  was million as of may  subject to the uncertainties further described in capital resources above and provided the proposed note exchange offer described above is successful  these contingent consideration obligations are not expected to affect our estimate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure requirements in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations at may   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions

table of contents income taxes as of may  and april   we recorded unrecognized tax benefits of million  and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  are included in our long term tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are not able to estimate the amount or timing of any cash payments required to settle these liabilities  however  we do not anticipate the settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months and do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements as of may   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
indemnification obligations we enter into standard license agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  we agree to indemnify our customers for losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of any patent  copyright  or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products 
these indemnification obligations have perpetual terms 
our normal business practice is to limit the maximum amount of indemnification to the amount received from the customer 
on occasion  the maximum amount of indemnification we may be required to make may exceed our normal business practices 
we estimate the fair value of our indemnification obligations as insignificant  based on our historical experience concerning product and patent infringement claims 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for indemnification under these agreements as of may  we have agreements whereby our officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we retain directors and officers insurance that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover portions of amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of may  in connection with certain of our recent business acquisitions  we have also agreed to assume  or cause our subsidiaries to assume  the indemnification obligations of those companies to their respective officers and directors 
no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of may  warranties we warrant to our customers that our products will conform to the documentation provided 
to date  there have been no payments or material costs incurred related to fulfilling these warranty obligations 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these warranties as of may  we assess the need for a warranty accrual on a quarterly basis  and there can be no guarantee that a warranty accrual will not become necessary in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term and long term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
as of may   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt  due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of our debt obligation 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt have no impact on our cash flows or consolidated financial statements 
credit risk during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the million auction rate securities we held failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
in october  we entered into an agreement with ubs which provides us with auction rate securities rights rights to sell our ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period june  through july  these rights are a separate freestanding instrument accounted for separately from the ars  and are registered  nontransferable securities accounted for as a purchased put option initially recorded at fair value 
under the rights agreement  ubs may  at its discretion  sell the ars at any time through july  without prior notice to us and must pay us par value for the ars within one day of the sale transaction settlement 
additionally  ubs offered a no net cost loan to us up to of the market value of the ars as determined by ubs until june  due to our entering into this agreement with ubs and enabling ubs to sell the ars at any time  the ars previously reported as available for sale have been transferred to trading securities 
based on the level valuation and the transfer of the ars from the available for sale category to the trading category  we recorded an other than temporary loss of million in valuation gain loss  net in the second quarter of including the transfer of accumulated temporary losses of million from other comprehensive loss previously recorded as a component of stockholder equity 
total other than temporary impairment loss of million was reported in the valuation gain loss  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and other short term operating cash flows  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  we completed an offering of million principal amount of the notes 
in order to minimize the dilutive effect from the issuance of the notes  concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we entered into convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our common stock  the exposure for which was held by credit suisse first boston international 
in may and may  we repurchased million and million  respectively  face value of our notes for million and million  respectively 
in doing so  we liquidated investments that generated a realized loss of approximately million related to the may repurchases 
there were no significant losses realized in connection with the may repurchases 
certain portions of the hedge and warrant transactions entered into by us in were terminated in connection with the repurchases 
the remaining portion of the hedging arrangements expired in may we believe that it was in the best interests of the stockholders to reduce the balance sheet debt despite the one time loss resulting from the liquidation of marketable securities
