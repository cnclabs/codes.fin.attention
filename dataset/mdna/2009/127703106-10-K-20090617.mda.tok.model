item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand cagle s inc  our operations and our present business environment 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes notes 
general we are in a highly stratified industry with the top five producers accounting for percent of poultry production in this country and the next fifteen accounting for percent 
our company currently produces ready to cook product of million pounds per week  placing it as the twenty first integrated broiler company ranked by ready to cook pounds 
cagle s produces a product which differentiates itself from the average broiler company  as industry live weights approach pounds per head  and our birds weigh approximately pounds per head 
while this difference impacts the fixed cost per unit of our operations  we believe it serves our company by allowing us to compete for a value added customer profile namely the fast food  institutional  and deli markets 
we believe this is a market segment that we excel in and can provide our customers with distinctive  quality product to fit their needs at margins necessary to offset the higher cost per unit brought about by the smaller live weight 
for the fiscal year ending  the company reported a loss of million or per diluted share compared to a loss of million or per diluted share for fiscal net sales for fiscal were million as compared to for fiscal poultry sales pounds for the year increased reflecting an increase in further processed  breaded products coupled with an average price per pound increase of when compared to fiscal head processed for the company were less in than reflecting cut backs in place during our third and fourth quarters of fiscal market prices compared to fiscal for boneless breast  leg quarters  wings  and boneless thighs were    respectively 
as a company we continue to focus on niche markets where we can react to our customer needs in a quick and efficient manner 
given our bird size and production facilities we continue to exploit our expertise in the deli fast food arena 
cost of production for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal for an increase of 
feed cost  which account for approximately of our total cost  increased for the year reflected as a increase in cost of sales 
in general a per bushel price change in corn or a per ton price change in soybean meal impacts our cost of sales by million dollars per year 
our workforce is made up of  dedicated employees who are encouraged to freely share suggestions to improve all phases of our operations 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for both and interest expense of million increased by as compared to the result of additional borrowings for the first three quarters of at the end of our fiscal year  our stockholder s equity was million with a net working capital of million 
total debt of million reflected an increase of or million this fiscal year 
as we begin fiscal demand for the cost effective protein offered by our products is improving and our markets are reacting in a positive manner which we anticipate will return our company to positive margin in the first quarter 
it is our expectation that capital expenditures will be funded by cash on hand and cash generated through operations 
year compared to the company had available million unused in established lines of credit as of march  and million unused in availability as of march  interest expense increased in by thousand  a increase  as compared to the same period a year ago

poultry sales for the year were basically unchanged correlated to a reduction in pounds marketed of and an increase in average market price of 
cost of sales increased as compared to  due to a million asset valuation adjustment to an inactive facility noted in the company s second quarter q 
when adjusted for the inactive facility charge  cost of sales remained relatively flat with an increase of versus the same period last year 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year as compared to million in fiscal representing an increase of 
of the increase experienced in fiscal bad debt expense was responsible for  salaries and benefits for and a decrease of fees for professional services had an impact of 
the company s share of earnings in the unconsolidated affiliate decreased by due to the sale of the affiliate on august  income taxes were adjusted as a result of the sale of the unconsolidated affiliate 
this transaction changed the income tax position of the company 
as a result of the loss of the continuing income from the subsidiary  certain recoverable state tax assets which could expire before being realized were adjusted 
financial condition liquidity analysis of cash flows we expect that cash flow from operations and cash on hand should be sufficient to fund operations  to make all payments of principal and interest when due  and to fund capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we had available million unused in our long term revolving line of credit as of march  this credit agreement matures on march  the company has received a temporary modification to the long term revolving line of credit whereby the tangible net worth requirement has been lowered from million to million through january  for the year ended march   the company used cash in its operating activities of  due primarily to the operating loss during the year 
cash used in investing activities was  with purchases of property  plant and equipment of  partially offset by proceeds from reduction of life insurance paid up values 
 cash was provided by net financing activities  with  from the net long term debt increase 

table of contents for the year ended march   the company used cash in its operating activities of  due primarily to the increase in inventories  which resulted from increases in grain costs 
cash was used in investing activities  in the amount of  to purchase property  plant and equipment

cash was provided from investing activities  in the amount of  due primarily from the cash received from the sale of an affiliate 
cash flow used in financing activities of  reflects the retirement of long term debt 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations contractual obligations at march  were as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon product shipment and transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of any discounts  allowances or promotions 
estimates for any special pricing arrangements  promotions or other volume based incentives are recorded upon shipment of the product in accordance with the terms of the promotion  allowance or pricing arrangements 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts reflecting estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
due to the nature of the industry and the short term nature of these accounts  there have not been material revisions in these estimates of management 
inventories live bird and hatching egg inventories are stated at cost and breeder hens are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  consistent with industry standards 
the costs associated with breeder hens are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over a forty week period 
finished poultry products  feed  and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we 
table of contents record valuations and adjustments for our inventories and for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of the inventories and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting the inventories obsolescence  including significantly aged products  discontinued product lines  or damaged or obsolete products 
we allocate meat costs between our various finished poultry products based on a by product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by product parts  which are carried in inventories at the estimated recovery amounts  with the remaining amount being reflected at cost or market  whichever is lower 
for inventory valuation purposes costs include live production costs principally feed  chick cost  medications and other raw materials  labor and production overhead 
not all broilers and breeders survive to maturity or disposition  normal losses are not expensed directly because total costs of the project are assigned to the survivors 
the company would record adjustments to reduce the values of processed poultry and feed inventories to fair market values if market prices for poultry or feed grains moved substantially lower  this would increase our cost of sales 
the company has not experienced material revisions to its inventory costs 
property  plant and equipment the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i future cash flows estimates expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in the company s operations  and estimated salvage values  and ii estimated fair market value of the assets 
contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  securities  environmental  product and other matters  and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
accrued self insurance insurance expense and liabilities for employee related health care benefits and casualty claims is estimated using historical experience  insurance and actuarial projections 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual liabilities and expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we review the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet  primarily operating loss carry forwards  based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels of operations and provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on april  fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax provision is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
the company had no significant unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption or at march  accordingly  the company does not have any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
however  if interest or penalties were to be incurred related to uncertain tax positions  such amounts would be recognized in income tax expense 
the company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of  and  respectively 
the company also has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of  the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are available to reduce income taxes through realization of these future tax benefits is dependent on the company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period 
due to the significant amount of income that would be needed to fully utilize the credits available  the company has recorded a valuation allowance for a significant portion of the deferred tax asset associated with the tax credit carryforwards 
the company expects to fully utilize the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and accordingly there is no valuation allowance associated with the net operating loss carryforwards

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk factors industry cyclicality can affect our earnings  especially due to fluctuations in the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken 
profitability in the chicken industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of chicken and feed ingredients  which are determined by supply and demand factors  which result in cyclical earnings fluctuations 
the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
in particular  weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner 
a sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients  as well as both the industry s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients  grow chickens  and deliver products 
high feed ingredient prices have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past 
we periodically seek  to the extent available  to enter into advance purchase commitments for the purchase of feed ingredients in an effort to manage our feed ingredient costs 
the use of such instruments may not be successful 
leverage our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we presently have  and expect to continue to have  an amount of indebtedness 
our indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds  and failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default or require redemption of indebtedness 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is dependent on various factors 
these factors include the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors that are beyond our control 
additional borrowings available despite our indebtedness  we are not prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness in the future 
contamination of products if our products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
livestock and poultry disease outbreaks of livestock diseases  in general  and poultry disease  in particular  can significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and environmentally sound manner 
however  events beyond our control  such as the outbreak of disease  could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
furthermore  an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken  to or from our suppliers  facilities  or customers  or require us to destroy one or more of our flocks 
this could result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our business  reputation  and prospects 
insurance we are exposed to risks relating to product liability  product recall  property damage  and injuries to persons for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited  and potentially inadequate 
significant competition competition in the chicken industry with other vertically integrated poultry companies could adversely affect our business 

table of contents government regulation regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting our business 
the chicken industry is subject to federal  state  and local governmental regulation  including health and environmental areas 
we anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety  the use of medication in feed formulations  and the disposal of poultry by products and wastewater discharges 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future 
forward looking statements this annual report  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  continues  may  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance  our anticipated growth and trends in our business  and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
readers are referred to risks and uncertainties identified above  under risk factors  and elsewhere herein
