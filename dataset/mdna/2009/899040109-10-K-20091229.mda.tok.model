results of operations the following discussion relates to the financial statements of the company for the fiscal year ended september  current year or fiscal in comparison to the fiscal year ended september  prior year or fiscal 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years ended september  i the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of operations to net sales  and ii the year to year changes in these items percentage of year to year net sales percentage change to net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss income nm interest expense interest income and other income nm loss income before income taxes nm income tax benefit expense nm net loss income nm nm not meaningful the components of net sales and gross profit are summarized in the table below dollars in millions of of amount total amount total net sales contract manufacturing and printing business imaging paper products net sales margin margin amount amount gross profit contract manufacturing and printing business imaging paper products gross profit fiscal year ended september  compared to september  net sales for fiscal decreased million from net sales for fiscal  due to a million decrease in the contract manufacturing segment and a million decrease in the business imaging paper products segment 
in contract manufacturing  the decrease in revenues for fiscal related primarily to a difficult continuing consumer environment for our customers 
while the company did generate new business during the year  the new business  along with cost reductions and productivity improvements  was not enough to offset the drop in demand 
the company is pursuing many opportunities to grow revenue 
for example  the company s new canister line became operational late in the fourth fiscal quarter 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be sustained revenues from the company s new canister line  that the new line will be profitable  that the general business climate will improve or that the company would benefit from such improvement 
the business imaging segment sales decrease was due to the recession and very competitive industry pricing 
both segments were negatively affected by the recession 
the company depends on two contract manufacturing customers for a significant portion of its business 
one customer accounted for of the company s total sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the second customer accounted for of the company s total sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal gross profit decreased million and gross profit percentage decreased to in compared to in the margin in the contract manufacturing segment decreased to in compared to in on a gross profit decrease of million 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a substantial decline in demand from our consumer products customers 
the company aggressively sought to cut operating costs with reductions in direct labor and overhead costs as a result of the company s continuing lean manufacturing  six sigma and cost cutting initiatives and added a number of new wipes customers 
as a result of these actions  in the second half of our fiscal year  contract manufacturing operating results improved over the first half of fiscal year operating results 
the business imaging segment experienced a decrease of million in gross profit and a decrease in margin to in from in this was primarily due to decreased demand for our customers products and very competitive industry pricing 
as the result of expense reductions and the addition of new customers  business imaging showed improvements in sales and operating income during the last six months of fiscal year as compared to the first six months of fiscal year both segments were negatively affected by the recession 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  in fiscal when compared to fiscal  consistent with cost reductions in general 
operating expenses were offset by a gain of  reflecting the gain on the sale of a bag sealer and case packer that was completed in the first quarter of fiscal interest expense decreased  in from due to lower average debt outstanding and lower interest rates on borrowings 
income tax benefit expense was million in compared to million in  mainly as a result of decreased profits 
basic and diluted net loss earnings per share were for compared to for selected quarterly financial data not required for a smaller reporting company 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operations were million for fiscal  and million in inventories decreased million in as a result of efforts to reduce average inventory levels for major raw material components in relation to decreases in net sales 
accounts receivable decreased million in resulting from decreased sales compared to accounts payable decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the decrease in materials purchased 
depreciation was million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company s working capital position for the years ended september  and was and million  respectively  as a result of the change in components discussed above 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal contract manufacturing spent approximately million on capital expenditures throughout the year to support ongoing operational needs and for payments on a canister line that became operational late in the fourth fiscal quarter and associated packaging equipment to support the company s growth efforts in the expanding  disposable nonwovens wipes market 
in business imaging  the amount spent on capital expenditures was  the company will purchase for  in december one of the presses currently being leased and has given notice to purchase the second press under lease in june  of which the amount is unknown 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  resulting primarily from the company paying down its revolving credit line 
in february  the company s board of directors approved a program for open market stock repurchases through december  for up to  shares of its common stock at prevailing market prices after concluding that the company s cash and debt position would enable these purchases without impairment to the company s capital 
on october   the company s board of directors approved an extension of its february stock repurchase program through june  and an increase in the number of shares from  to  on january   the company s board of directors approved a further extension of its february stock repurchase program through september  and a increase in the number of shares from  to  a total of  shares were purchased under the plan for an aggregate purchase price of  from approval of the plan through september  the company s primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories  accounts receivable  and capital expenditures 
at september   cash recorded on the balance sheet was  the contract manufacturing segment s sales are made pursuant to project specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with multi year terms 
sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases 
the company has contracts for both printing and contract manufacturing 
one of these contract customers  a multinational consumer products company  accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and of total sales in fiscal the contract with this customer expires in april another multinational consumer products company accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and of total sales in fiscal the contract with this customer has been extended until june however  because the company s contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements  the revenues attributable to the contracts are subject to normal business fluctuations 
the company replaced its credit agreement on may  with a new million unsecured revolving line of credit facility that expires in may the company currently intends to extend or replace the agreement prior to its expiration 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus 
the company is required to pay a non usage fee of 
per annum on the unused portion of the facility 
availability under the facility is based upon specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit agreement is unsecured 
if the company fails to meet a specified funded debt to ebitda ratio  the company s lender will have the right to take a security interest in the company s accounts receivables and inventory 
liquidity and capital resources continued borrowings under the previous million unsecured credit agreement were made under the base rate account or the eurodollar account 
interest on amounts borrowed under the base rate account were calculated based on the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus of or the prime rate on the date of the borrowing 
interest on amounts borrowed under the eurodollar account were calculated based on libor 
the company had million available under the line of credit as of september  the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  including requirements to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and after tax net income or loss within specified levels 
at september   the company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the credit agreement 
on december   the company had approximately million available and million outstanding under its revolving credit line pursuant to its credit agreement 
consistent with the sales concentration previously discussed  amounts due from two multinational consumer products customers represent and of total accounts receivable at september  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s operating cash flow  together with amounts available under its credit agreement  are adequate to service the company s current obligations as of september  and any budgeted capital expenditures  including the purchase of the leased presses  assuming the company meets its business plan 
the company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future 
in addition  pursuant to the credit agreement  the company s primary lenders must approve the payment of any dividends over million 
inflation in fiscal years and  the impact of inflation was minimal on the company s inventory and net income 
management believes that the company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the company s products  although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases 
prior to these periods  the impact of inflation has been minimal on the company s inventory and operations 
credit environment the credit markets continue to be volatile and experience liquidity shortages due to the instability in the lending industry and overall downturn in the economy 
the company does not engage in any business activities in the lending industry 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity under its credit agreement at variable interest rates and from cash provided by operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates as described below 
we believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position and results of operations for the company 
financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period 
actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated 
differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectability of consideration to be received is reasonably assured  all of which generally occur at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales 
accounts receivable management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances 
these allowances are based on the customer relationships  the aging and turns of accounts receivable  credit worthiness of customers  credit concentrations and payment history 
management s estimates include providing for percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates to the most recent months sales  less actual write offs to date 
although management monitors collections and credit worthiness  the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing 
management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues 
recoveries of accounts receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
credit terms to customers in the contract manufacturing segment are generally net days 
credit terms to customers in the business imaging segment are generally discounted net terms 
management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits  and applies these trend rates to the most recent months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation 
the company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability on the annual measurement date of june in order to calculate goodwill  management applies judgment in determining the reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the business 
the annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss 
calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or any changes in market conditions  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability based on fair market value estimated using estimated future cash flows and prices of comparable companies in accordance with accounting standards codification asc formerly sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques  including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses 
in the event that valuation multiples decline  discount rates increase  or the projected cash flows of the individual reporting units decline  the company may be required to proceed through an analysis of impairment as provided in asc for example  an increase to the discount rate due to changes in risk premiums or other factors may suggest that an impairment has occurred under step of asc and require the company to proceed to step of asc to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities of the reporting units 
the current discount rate would need to increase for contract manufacturing critical accounting policies continued and increase for business imaging before the company would be required to proceed to step of asc the company recognizes that its common stock regularly trades below book value per share and will continue to monitor the relationship of its market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value 
while management is seeking to return the company s business fundamentals to levels that support the book value per share  there is no assurance that it will be successful in doing so  or that the market price of the common stock will increase to such levels in the foreseeable future 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment for disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the company determines fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques 
additional information on the company s accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report as referenced to the appendix to this report 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards codification asc subsequent events 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
specifically  this standard sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the company has adopted this standard during the fiscal period ended september  and has evaluated any subsequent events through december  during the period subsequent to september   the company did not have any material recognizable subsequent events
