risk factors above  in evaluating any statement in this report on form k or otherwise made by us or on our behalf 
the following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
we have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements 
overview we are a full service communications provider and one of the largest exchange telephone carriers in the country 
on july   we sold our competitive local exchange carrier clec  electric lightwave  llc eli 
we accounted for eli as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of operations 
on march   we completed the acquisition of commonwealth telephone enterprises  inc commonwealth or cte  which included a small clec component 
this acquisition expanded our presence in pennsylvania and strengthened our position as a leading full service communications provider to rural markets 
on october   we completed the acquisition of global valley networks  inc and gvn services together gvn  which expanded our presence in california and also strengthened our rural position 
as of december   we operated in states with approximately  employees 
competition in the telecommunications industry is intense and increasing 
we experience competition from many telecommunications service providers  including cable operators offering voip products  wireless carriers  long distance providers  competitive local exchange carriers  internet providers and other wireline carriers 
we believe that as of december   approximately of the households in our territories had voip as an available service option from cable operators 
we also believe that competition will continue to intensify in and may result in reduced revenues 
our business experienced a decline in access lines and switched access minutes in and  primarily as a result of competition and business downsizing 
we also experienced a reduction in revenue in as compared to the recent severe contraction in the global financial markets and ongoing recession may be impacting consumer behavior to reduce household expenditures by not purchasing our services and or by discontinuing some or all of our services 
these trends are likely to continue and may result in a challenging revenue environment 
these factors could also result in increased delinquencies and bankruptcies and  therefore  affect our ability to collect money owed to us by residential and business customers 
we employ a number of strategies to combat the competitive pressures and changes to consumer behavior noted above 
our strategies are focused in the following areas customer retention  upgrading and up selling services to our existing customer base  new customer growth  win backs  new product deployment  and operating expense and capital expenditure reductions 
we hope to achieve our customer retention goals by bundling services around the local access line and providing exemplary customer service 
bundled services include high speed internet  unlimited long distance calling  enhanced telephone features and video offerings 
we tailor these services to the needs of our residential and business customers in the markets we serve and continually evaluate the introduction of new and complementary products and services  which can also be purchased separately 
customer retention is also enhanced by offering one  two and three year price protection plans where customers commit to a term in exchange for predictable pricing and or promotional offers 
additionally  we are focused on enhancing the customer experience as we believe exceptional customer service will differentiate us from our competition 
our commitment to providing exemplary customer service is demonstrated by the expansion of our customer services hours  shorter scheduling windows for in home appointments and the implementation of call reminders and follow up calls for service appointments 
in addition  due to a recent realignment and restructuring of approximately local area markets  those markets are now operated by local managers with responsibility for the customer experience  as well as the financial results  in those markets 
we utilize targeted and innovative promotions to sell new customers  including those moving into our territory  win back previously lost customers  upgrade and up sell existing customers a variety of service offerings including high speed internet  video  and enhanced long distance and feature packages in order to maximize the average revenue per access line wallet share paid to frontier 
depending upon market and economic conditions  we may offer such promotions to drive sales in the future 
lastly  we are focused on introducing a number of new products that our customers desire  including unlimited long distance minutes  bundles of long distance minutes  wireless data  internet portal advertising and the frontier peace of mind product suite 
this last category is a suite of products aimed at managing the total communications and personal computing experience for our customers 
the peace of mind product and services are designed to provide value and simplicity to meet our customers ever changing needs 
the peace of mind product and services suite includes services such as an in home  full installation of our high speed product  two hour appointment windows for the installation  hard drive back up services  enhanced help desk pc support and inside wire maintenance 
we offer a portion of our peace of mind services  including hard drive back up services and enhanced help desk pc support  both to our customers and to other users inside and outside of our service territories 
although we are optimistic about the opportunities provided by each of these initiatives  we can provide no assurance about their long term profitability or impact on revenue 
we believe that the combination of offering multiple products and services to our customers pursuant to price protection programs  billing them on a single bill  providing superior customer service  and being active in our local communities will make our customers more loyal to us  and will help us generate new  and retain existing  customer revenue 
revenues from data and internet services such as high speed internet continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues and revenues from services such as local line and access charges including federal and state subsidies are decreasing as a percentage of our total revenues 
federal and state subsidy revenue was million in  or of our revenues  down from million in  or of our revenues 
we expect this trend to continue in the decreasing revenue from traditional sources  along with the potential for increasing operating costs  could cause our profitability and our cash generated by operations to decrease 
a liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million 
our primary source of funds continued to be cash generated from operations 
for the year ended december   we used cash flow from operations  incremental borrowings and cash on hand to fund all of our investing and financing activities  including debt repayments and stock repurchases 
we believe our operating cash flows  existing cash balances  and revolving credit facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  make required debt payments through  pay taxes  pay dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy and support our short term and long term operating strategies 
however  a number of factors  including but not limited to  increased cash taxes  losses of access lines  increases in competition  lower subsidy and access revenues and the impact of the current economic environment are expected to reduce our cash generated by operations 
in addition  although we believe  based on information available to us  that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility would be able to fulfill their commitments to us  given the current economic environment and the recent severe contraction in the global financial markets  this could change in the future 
further  the current credit market turmoil and our below investment grade credit ratings may make it more difficult and expensive to refinance our maturing debt  although we do not have any significant maturities until we have approximately million and million of debt maturing in and  respectively 
cash flow provided by and used in operating activities cash provided by operating activities declined million  or  for as compared to the decline resulted from a drop in operating income  as adjusted for non cash items  lower investment income  a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in current income tax expenditures 
these declines were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable that positively impacted our cash position as compared to the prior year 
we have in recent years paid relatively low amounts of cash taxes 
we expect that in and beyond our cash taxes will increase substantially  as our federal net operating loss carryforwards and amt tax credit carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized 
we paid million in cash taxes during  and expect to pay approximately million to million in our cash tax estimate reflects the anticipated favorable impact of bonus depreciation that is part of the economic stimulus package signed into law by president obama

critical accounting policies and estimates we review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication 
uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements  accordingly  it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets  depreciation and amortization  pension and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  contingencies and purchase price allocations among others 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to such estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debts based on our estimate of collectability of our accounts receivable through a review of aging categories and specific customer accounts 
in and  we had no critical estimates related to telecommunications bankruptcies 
asset impairment in and  we had no critical estimates related to asset impairments 
intangibles our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name  which resulted from the purchase of ilec properties 
we test for impairment of these assets annually  or more frequently  as circumstances warrant 
all of our ilec properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result  we aggregate our four operating segments into one reportable segment 
in determining fair value of goodwill during we compared the net book value of the reporting units to current trading multiples of ilec properties as well as trading values of our publicly traded common stock 
additionally  we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity 
our test determined that fair value exceeded book value of goodwill for each of our reporting units 
depreciation and amortization the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
an independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our plant assets is performed annually 
we adopted the lives proposed in the study effective october  our composite depreciation rate increased from to as a result of the study 
we anticipate depreciation expense of approximately million to million for we periodically reassess the useful life of our intangible assets to determine whether any changes to those lives are required 
pension and other postretirement benefits our estimates of pension expense  other postretirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are critical accounting estimates 
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering a significant number of current and former employees and other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical  dental  life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents 
the pension plans for the majority of our current employees are frozen 
the accounting results for pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts 
these actuarial assumptions include the following discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover  healthcare cost trend rates  expected retirement age  optional form of benefit and mortality 
we review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries 
we consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions 
the discount rate is used to value  on a present basis  our pension and postretirement benefit obligation as of the balance sheet date 
the same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year 
the measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date 
our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term  high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation 
in making this determination we consider  among other things  the yields on the citigroup pension discount curve  the citigroup above median pension curve  the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next 
this rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that impact corporate bond yields 
our discount rate was at year end and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in determining the periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  we considered published surveys of expected market returns  and year actual returns of various major indices  and our own historical year  year and year investment returns 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of to in fixed income securities  to in equity securities and to in alternative investments 
we review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate 
our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year 
in  we did not change our expected long term rate of return from the used in our pension plan assets are valued at actual market value as of the measurement date 
we expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for will be million to million they were million in  and that we may be required to make a cash contribution to our pension plan beginning in no contribution was made to our pension plan during income taxes our effective tax rates in  and were approximately at the statutory rates 
contingencies at december   we had a reserve of million in connection with a potential environmental claim in bangor  maine 
this claim was settled with a payment of million plus additional expenses during the third quarter of we currently do not have any contingencies in excess of million recorded on our books 
purchase price allocation commonwealth and gvn the allocation of the approximate billion paid to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities of commonwealth is a critical estimate 
we finalized our estimate of the fair values assigned to plant  customer list and goodwill  as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the estimated expected life of a customer used to amortize the customer list is a critical estimate

revenue revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local  network access  long distance and data and internet services 
such revenues are generated through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage at a tariffed rate and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management  with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts 
consolidated revenue for decreased million  or  to  million as compared to excluding additional revenue attributable to the cte and gvn acquisitions for a full year in and for a partial period in  our revenue decreased million during  or  as compared to during the first quarter of  we had a significant favorable settlement of a carrier dispute that resulted in a favorable one time impact to our revenue of million 
excluding the additional revenue due to the one time favorable settlement in the first quarter of and the additional revenue attributable to the cte and gvn acquisitions in and  our revenue for the year ended december  declined million  or  as compared to the prior year 
this decline is a result of lower local services revenue  subsidy revenue and switched access revenue  partially offset by a million  or  increase in data and internet services revenue  each as described in more detail below 
consolidated revenue for increased million  or  to  million as compared to excluding the additional revenue attributable to the cte and gvn acquisitions in  and the one time favorable settlement as referenced above in  our revenue for was  million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to  primarily resulting from a reduction of million in subsidies received from federal and state funds 
change in the number of our access lines is one factor that is important to our revenue and profitability 
we have lost access lines primarily because of competition  changing consumer behavior including wireless substitution  economic conditions  changing technology and by some customers disconnecting second lines when they add high speed internet or cable modem service 
we lost approximately  access lines net  including  second lines  during  but added approximately  high speed internet subscribers net during this same period 
we expect to continue to lose access lines but to increase high speed internet subscribers during although not enough to offset access line losses 
while the number of access lines are an important metric to gauge certain revenue trends  it is not necessarily the best or only measure to evaluate the business 
management believes that understanding different components of revenue is most important 
for this reason  presented on page is a breakdown that categorizes revenue into customer revenue and regulatory revenue switched and subsidy revenue 
despite the decline in access lines  our customer revenue  which is all revenue except switched access and subsidy revenue  also improved by more than percent in versus the average monthly customer revenue per access line has improved and resulted in an increased wallet share  primarily from residential customers 
a substantial further loss of access lines  combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed herein may cause our revenue  profitability and cash flows to decrease in our historical results include the results of operations of commonwealth from the date of its acquisition on march  and of gvn from the date of its acquisition on october  the financial tables below include a comparative analysis of our results of operations on a historical basis for  and we have also presented an analysis of each category for for the results of frontier excluding cte and gvn and the results of our acquisitions cte from march  through december   and the results of gvn for the last two months of  as included in the consolidated results of operations

many factors may lead to further increases in the nacpl  thereby resulting in decreases in our federal subsidy revenue in the future 
the fcc and state regulators are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for federal subsidies is determined as well as the amounts of such subsidies 
on may  the fcc issued an order to cap competitive eligible telecommunications companies cetc receipts from the high cost federal universal service fund 
while this order will have no impact on our current receipt levels  we believe this is a positive first step to limit the rapid growth of the fund 
the cetc cap will remain in place until the fcc takes additional steps towards needed reform 
the fcc is considering proposals that may significantly change interstate  intrastate and local intercarrier compensation and would revise the federal universal service funding and disbursement mechanisms 
when and how these proposed changes will be addressed are unknown and  accordingly  we are unable to predict the impact of future changes on our results of operations 
however  future reductions in our subsidy and access revenues will directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have associated variable expenses 
certain states have open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation 
we cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or access revenues 
in addition  we have been approached by  and or are involved in formal state proceedings with  various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities  including those associated with our pension assets 
market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a result  we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks  and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk as follows interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio 
our long term debt as of december  was approximately fixed rate debt with minimal exposure to interest rate changes after the termination of our remaining interest rate swap agreements on january  our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  all but million of our borrowings at december  have fixed interest rates 
consequently  we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
an adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure at december   a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on january   we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements representing million notional amount of indebtedness associated with our senior notes due in and cash proceeds on the swap terminations of approximately million were received in january the related gain has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheet  and is being amortized into interest expense over the term of the associated debt 
sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure at december   the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately billion  based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of and our overall weighted average maturity of approximately years 
there has been no material change in the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations since december  equity price exposure our exposure to market risks for changes in security prices as of december  is limited to our pension assets 
we have no other security investments of any material amount 
during  the diminished availability of credit and liquidity in the united states and throughout the global financial system has resulted in substantial volatility in financial markets and the banking system 
these and other economic events have had an adverse impact on investment portfolios 
as a result of negative investment returns and ongoing benefit payments  the company s pension plan assets have declined from million at december  to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease represents a decline in asset value of million  or  and benefits paid of million  or 
the decline in pension plan assets did not impact our results of operations  liquidity or cash flows in however  we expect that our pension expense will increase in and that we may be required to make a cash contribution to our pension plan beginning in
