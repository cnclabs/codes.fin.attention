we use ebitda as a liquidity performance measure and believe ebitda is useful in evaluating our liquidity because the calculation generally eliminates the effects of financing costs and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions  which are assessed and evaluated through other operating performance measures 
ebitda is also commonly used as a measure of operating and liquidity performance for companies in our industry and is frequently used by analysts  investors  lenders  rating agencies and other interested parties to evaluate a company s financial performance and its ability to incur and service debt 
ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles and  therefore  represents a non gaap financial measure 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for consolidated statements of income and cash flows data prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles as it excludes components that are significant in understanding and assessing our results of operations and cash flows 
ebitda as measured in this annual report on form k is not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview it was the best of times  it was the worst of times 
was another year of record results for us  with higher revenues  profits and cash flows than our company has ever experienced 
this occurred in a year when the us economy was technically in an economic recession 
the first nine months of were very strong for us  as well as for others in our industry  however  in the fourth quarter the effects of the depressed economy impacted our industry in a very significant and rapid manner 
even in this environment  we remained solidly profitable in the fourth quarter 
we believe our focused growth strategy of diversifying our products  customers and geographic locations has somewhat lessened the impact of the current recession on our financial results  especially with our minimal exposure to the auto and residential housing markets 
we continued our growth strategy in with small  strategic acquisitions in april and september  and our largest acquisition to date based on transaction value 
our billion purchase of pna group holding corporation pna on august strengthened our position in many of our carbon steel products and expanded our geographic reach in these products 
pna s annual sales were billion 
we financed this transaction with borrowings on our billion credit facility and with a new million term loan 
this financing replaced pna s existing high cost debt of approximately million with our lower cost debt 
we spent million on capital expenditures in a significant portion of our spending related to growth initiatives  including the expansion and relocation of existing facilities  enhancing and adding processing capabilities  penetrating new geographic markets and expanding product offerings at existing locations 
we opened new domestic facilities that diversified our product offerings in those geographic areas 
we also opened facilities in china and singapore to support existing us customers as they have expanded their operations overseas 
we curtailed all but required spending in the fourth quarter  and currently have a capital expenditure budget of million 
we have also suspended acquisition activity 
however  we will continue to actively monitor acquisition and internal growth opportunities  and expect to continue to grow our company with accretive acquisitions and internal growth activities that enhance our product  geographic and customer diversity when we believe the business climate and credit markets will support such growth 
we believe that the poor economy may create certain growth opportunities that we will evaluate and act upon if we believe it is in the best interest of reliance 
we generated record cash flow from operations of million in  with most of this generated in the fourth quarter when we were in an inventory destocking mode 
pro forma for the pna acquisition on august   our net debt to capital ratio was just under and we had million outstanding on our revolving credit facility  leaving our availability at just under million 
we were comfortable with this limited liquidity at the time  even in light of the severe financial crisis that was developing  as we were confident in our ability to generate cash flow from operations through our profitability and working capital reductions 
as both demand and pricing for our products worsened in late  our working capital reductions became much more significant 
at december   our net debt to total capital ratio was down to and we had repaid million of debt since the closing of the pna acquisition  including million on our revolving credit facility  along with million on our term loan and million of senior notes that matured 
through february   we have repaid an additional million of our debt  including million on our credit facility and a million senior note that matured 
as a result  our outstanding borrowings were million  providing million of availability on our credit facility as of february  we are comfortable with our ability to finance our operations and any current obligations that we have coming due in or without any need to access the credit markets 
our billion credit facility and our million term loan expire in november we have million of scheduled debt maturities in and million in we expect to fund these obligations with our cash flow from operations and availability on our credit facility 
demand for most products that we sell was down slightly from levels through the first three quarters of  but then deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter 
pricing was extremely volatile in benchmark carbon steel hot rolled coil prices were about per ton at the end of  increased to a high of  per ton in may and june of and then ended the year at per ton according to american metal market 
although less than of our sales dollars were in carbon steel hot rolled coil  this is a strong indicator of overall carbon steel pricing 
we sell more carbon steel plate and long products  with total carbon steel products representing approximately of our sales dollars 
the increased pricing environment allowed us to increase revenues and expand profit margins during the first three quarters of the year 
in the fourth quarter carbon steel prices began to plummet 
this was caused mainly by significant decreases in scrap carbon steel prices and significant reductions in demand 
service centers  including us  halted purchases because our customers had slowed their buying 
table of contents activity 
this resulted in service centers having too much inventory at costs in excess of market  causing an extremely competitive environment as service centers attempted to sell their higher cost inventory in the face of weakening demand 
this negatively impacted our profit margins in the fourth quarter 
stainless steel products  that represented approximately of our sales dollars  continued to experience pricing volatility in  but the volatility was not as extreme as in demand continues to be a challenge for these products 
costs for common alloy aluminum products  which represented approximately of our sales dollars  declined by over in the last five months of  mainly because of weakened demand and excess supply  negatively pressuring our profit margins 
the decline in the costs for most aluminum products in this period was mainly due to the sharp decrease in the aluminum ingot price by approximately 
continues to be a very difficult operating environment 
although our customers continue to purchase metal  demand levels have not yet improved from year end levels and we are uncertain as to when there will be any meaningful improvement in demand 
because of this  carbon steel mills are operating at less than of capacity 
this is somewhat positive for us  as we believe the limited supply of carbon steel products has caused pricing to reach a bottom at about per ton for carbon steel hot rolled coil 
although we do not expect any significant or long term pricing improvement in  with prices stabilized we can better manage our profit margins 
we believe that demand must improve before we will see any meaningful improvements in pricing  however current prices for carbon steel products remain at a strong level compared to historical standards 
we are uncertain as to stainless steel and aluminum pricing in  but do not believe that prices will decrease significantly  or at all  because most aluminum producers cannot remain profitable at current pricing levels 
beginning in the third quarter  we began to reduce our operating costs 
our most significant operating expense is personnel costs and in reaction to the reduced activity levels we reduced our workforce by in the fourth quarter 
we have continued to take actions to further reduce our costs in and will take further actions if the environment continues to deteriorate 
we believe that we are quick to react to changes in business conditions and that these steps allow us to operate efficiently and profitably even in less favorable economies 
we believe our consistent focus on cost controls and inventory turnover and our product  customer and geographic diversification will allow us to weather the current economic crisis better than most of our competitors and that this may provide longer term growth opportunities for us 
further declines in demand or pricing for our products could further reduce our gross profit margins 
customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases our revenue dollars increase  which contributes to increased gross profit dollars 
variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines  we typically produce fewer revenue dollars which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce certain variable expenses when volumes decline  but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 
pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increases 
if prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure  the impact on our results of operations from changes in pricing is much greater than the effect of volume changes 
also  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this could increase our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we can typically generate stronger levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease 
acquisitions on september   through our newly formed singapore company reliance metalcenter asia pacific  pte  ltd 
rmap  we acquired the assets  including the inventory  machinery  and equipment  of the singapore operation of hln metal centre pte

we are in the process of building a new  larger facility for pdm steel service centers in las vegas  nevada  which should be completed in early our budget was million  with the majority of the amount related to growth projects 
as the economy deteriorated in  we pulled back on our capital expenditures 
we have also closed a few small facilities and may close additional facilities if business conditions warrant 
our capital expenditure budget is million 
although a large portion of this amount is growth related  we reduced our budget significantly to focus our use of cash on debt paydowns 
we have many additional growth projects that we expect to initiate once we are comfortable that the economic outlook has improved 
because of the significant capital expenditures we have made to replace and improve our equipment and facilities over the past few years  our maintenance costs are not burdensome

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our annual consolidated sales of billion were our highest ever  up from  with an increase in tons sold and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold our tons sold and average selling price per ton sold amounts exclude the sales of precision strip because of the toll processing nature of its business 
our acquisition of pna on august   contributed significantly to the increase in our sales levels 
same store sales  which exclude the sales of our and acquisitions  were billion in  up from  with a decrease in our tons sold and a increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
for the first ten months of we experienced some overall weakening in our end markets from levels but beginning in november the decline in demand became much more dramatic as general economic conditions weakened across all of our end markets 
as previously discussed  mill pricing for carbon steel products increased rapidly in the first half of  almost doubling during that period 
we were able to pass these increases on to our customers through increased selling prices during that time  causing a significant increase in our average selling price per ton sold over levels 
then  beginning in october  carbon steel prices came spiraling down  ending the year at a level approximately where they started the year 
the decreases occurred in a more compressed time period than the increases  which  combined with the demand deterioration  caused significant competitive pressures that caused us to reduce our selling prices faster than our costs were declining 
in addition  our average selling price was impacted by the change in product mix resulting from our acquisition of pna  with carbon steel products representing of our total sales  compared to in because carbon steel product prices are generally lower than aluminum  alloy and stainless steel prices  the increase in our consolidated average selling price in was substantially less than the increase in our same store average selling price 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of billion  up from  increased mainly because of our higher net sales level in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  down from in the mill pricing volatility experienced in was the primary driver of our gross profit margins 
during the first half of the year when the mills were announcing significant price increases for carbon steel products  we were able to increase our selling prices to our 
table of contents customers before we received the higher cost metal in our inventory  which allowed us to expand our gross profit margins in that period 
however  when the mills rapidly reduced prices beginning in october  we had to significantly reduce our selling prices to remain competitive 
service centers went into an inventory destocking mode  attempting to clean out higher cost inventory and replace it with lower cost inventory 
doing this in an environment of rapidly deteriorating customer demand caused extreme competitive pressure in the industry that had a very negative impact on our gross profit margin  especially as we were also in a destocking mode 
our gross profit margin was also impacted by our acquisition of pna on august st 
the pna companies have operated at lower gross profit levels historically than the reliance companies 
excluding the pna companies from our results would have resulted in a gross profit margin of 
we expect to improve pna s gross profit margins over time  however  given the current economic and pricing environment this may take longer than we originally anticipated 
furthermore  our lifo reserve adjustment  which is included in our cost of sales and therefore gross profit  was significantly larger in than in our year end lifo reserve adjustment resulted in expense of million during  compared to million in the significant increases in carbon steel prices in as compared to year end levels resulted in net lifo expense for the year 
expenses 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses for increased million  or from mainly due to our and acquisitions and general cost increases 
the expenses as a percent of sales in were  lower than the period 
the overall increase in average carbon steel pricing in helped to lower the ratio of our expenses as a percent of sales 
also  the acquisition of the pna companies favorably impacted our sg a expenses as a percentage of sales as they have historically operated at lower operating expense levels than the reliance companies 
we continue to focus on cost control and take appropriate cost reduction measures when needed 
most recently  during the fourth quarter we reduced our workforce by about in addition to other personnel cost saving actions in reaction to the deteriorating business activity levels in our industry 
depreciation expense increased million in mainly because of our and acquisitions  along with depreciation expense of our capital expenditures 
amortization expense increased million  or  because of the amortization of our intangibles from our and acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses  depreciation expense and amortization expense  was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating income of million and an operating profit margin of 
the increased profit is mainly due to higher gross profit dollars resulting from increased sales levels  however  our operating income margins deteriorated because of our lower gross profit margins in our operating income reflects the strong environment for pricing that existed during most of and our ability to take advantage of this environment  along with the effect of the deteriorating business climate in our fourth quarter results 
other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase is mainly due to borrowings to fund our billion acquisition of pna on august  offset by lower interest rates during income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was compared to for the decrease in our effective rate is mainly due to a lower state rate because of the pna acquisition that shifted a portion of our taxable income to states with lower rates 
net income 
our net income in was million compared to million during the increase was primarily due to higher gross profit and operating income dollars generated from the higher commodity prices during as well as the impact of our acquisitions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our annual consolidated sales of billion were up from  with a increase in tons sold and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
our acquisitions along with our acquisitions of emj on april  and yarde metals on august   contributed significantly to the increase in our sales levels 
same store sales  which exclude the sales of our and acquisitions  were billion in  up from  with a decrease in our tons sold and a increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
demand from most markets was relatively strong in  but down somewhat from our levels 
in  we experienced significant strength in sales of 
table of contents our products to the non residential construction and aerospace industries 
although we experienced various degrees of pricing volatility in all the metal products that we sell  with the most significant volatility in stainless steel products  overall pricing levels were above levels 
historically low levels of imported metal products into the us in contributed to the strength of domestic prices 
import levels were low due to foreign mills re routing their products to europe and asia where prices were higher due to the weak us dollar and strong global demand 
our average price on a consolidated basis increased somewhat due to a shift in our product mix from our and acquisitions 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of billion  up from  increased mainly because of our higher net sales level in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  down from in the decline in our gross profit margin in was mainly due to significant competitive pressures during the year  especially in the first half  resulting from excess inventories throughout the industry 
a significant amount of this destocking by our competitors was in stainless steel products 
stainless steel costs were increasing significantly in the first half of and we can typically increase our gross profit margins in these environments  however  the destocking caused us to reduce our selling prices to compete  thereby reducing our gross profit margins 
in the third quarter  stainless steel costs experienced sudden and significant declines 
this adversely impacted our margins because we had to reduce our stainless steel selling prices more rapidly than our inventory costs on hand were reduced 
in the fourth quarter of  costs of most products were stable with third quarter levels  allowing us to realize some improvement in our gross profit margins from third quarter levels 
also  our lifo expense was lower in than in we recorded lifo expense  which is included in our cost of sales  of million during  compared to million in our lifo expense resulted mainly from the further increases in the cost of stainless steel products at year end compared to the beginning of the year  although at a much lower rate than in expenses 
s  g a expenses for increased million  or from mainly due to our and acquisitions and general cost increases 
the expenses as a percent of sales in were  the same as in the period 
we continue to focus on cost control and take appropriate cost reduction measures when needed 
depreciation expense increased million in mainly because of our and acquisitions and because of depreciation of our capital expenditures 
amortization expense increased million  or  because of the amortization of our intangibles from our and acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses  depreciation expense and amortization expense  was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating income of million and an operating income margin of 
the increased profit is mainly due to higher gross profit dollars resulting from increased sales levels  however  our operating income margins deteriorated because of our lower gross profit margins in other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was mainly due to increased borrowings to fund our acquisitions 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was compared to for the rate is slightly lower than the rate due to increased international exposure through our acquisitions and various tax credits that were available to us in net income 
our net income increased to million from million in primarily due to the full year impact of our acquisitions of emj and yarde on our operating results during liquidity and capital resources at december   our working capital was billion  up from billion at december  the increase in our working capital was mainly due to our pna acquisition 
excluding the initial effect of acquisitions  we decreased our accounts receivable balance by million  our inventory level by million and our accounts payable and other liabilities balance by million in to manage our working capital  we focus on our days sales outstanding to monitor accounts receivable and on our inventory turnover rate to monitor our inventory levels  as receivables and inventory are our two most significant elements of working capital 
at december   our days sales outstanding were approximately days  up slightly from our december  rate of days 
we calculate our days sales outstanding as an average of the most recent two month period 
this slight increase was mainly due to the impact of the pna acquisition as many of the pna companies have slightly longer payment 
table of contents terms than the reliance companies 
we are comfortable with our current dso rate  however  we have noted some increased closures and bankruptcy filings in the customer end markets that we serve  as reflected in the increase in our accounts receivable reserve to million 
our total accounts receivable write offs were million  or less than one tenth of one percent of sales 
our inventory turn rate at december  was about times or months on hand  lower than our rate of times or months on hand 
our inventory values increased significantly during the year mainly due to the carbon steel price increases  which negatively impacted our inventory turn rate when demand declined significantly during the fourth quarter 
also  our turns were impacted by the pna acquisition 
excluding the pna companies  who turned their inventories at times in the five months that we owned them  our inventory turn rate was times 
as demand and pricing for our products increase or decrease  our working capital needs increase or decrease  respectively 
because our costs for most metals are still declining we expect our working capital needs to be less in the near term 
if commodity prices and demand begin improving we expect to finance increases in our working capital needs through operating cash flow or with borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
our primary sources of liquidity are generally from internally generated funds from operations and our revolving credit facility 
cash flow provided by operations increased to million in compared to million in our increased size and profit levels along with our focus on reducing working capital in the fourth quarter produced our strong cash flow from operations that funded our capital expenditures of approximately million  acquisitions of approximately million  excluding assumption of debt  and stock repurchases of million during the year 
our outstanding debt including capital lease obligations at december  was billion 
at december   we had million borrowed on our billion revolving line of credit 
on august   we increased our borrowings by approximately billion to finance the acquisition of pna and the related repayment or refinancing of pna s outstanding indebtedness 
we funded this with million from a new senior unsecured term loan bearing interest  in  at libor plus  with quarterly principal installment payments of million and the balance due november  and with borrowings under our existing credit facility bearing interest  at december   at libor plus or the bank prime rate  due november  
our net debt to total capital ratio was at december   up from our year end rate of but down from our september  rate of net debt to total capital is calculated as total debt  net of cash  divided by shareholders equity plus total debt  net of cash 
through december   we have repaid approximately million of debt since the closing of the pna acquisition  including million on our revolving credit facility  along with million on our term loan and million of senior notes that matured 
from january through february   we have repaid an additional million of our debt  including million on our credit facility and a million senior note that matured 
as a result  our outstanding borrowings were million  providing million of availability on our credit facility as of february  we are comfortable with our ability to finance our operations and any current obligations that we have coming due in or without any need to access the credit markets 
our billion credit facility and our million term loan expire in november we have million of scheduled debt maturities in and million in because of the global credit tightening  we are currently limiting our uses of cash to the most important capital expenditure items and maintaining dividends to our shareholders 
our free cash flow will primarily be used to reduce debt 
on november  we entered into an indenture the indenture  for the issuance of million of unsecured debt securities which are guaranteed by all of our direct and indirect  wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and any entities that become such subsidiaries during the term of the indenture collectively  the subsidiary guarantors 
none of our foreign subsidiaries or our non wholly owned domestic subsidiaries is a guarantor 
the total debt issued was comprised of two tranches  a million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  and b million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations 
in april  these notes were exchanged for publicly traded notes registered with the securities and exchange commission 
at our option  we may redeem all or part of the notes of either series at any time prior to their maturity by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments as defined in the indenture  plus  in each case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to  but not including  the redemption date 
at december   we also had million of outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in private placements of debt 
the outstanding senior notes bear interest at an average fixed rate of and have an average remaining life of years  maturing from to in early january  million of these notes matured and were paid off 
our billion syndicated credit facility  million senior unsecured term loan and our senior notes collectively require that we maintain a 
table of contents minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio  and a maximum leverage ratio and include change of control provisions  among other things 
the interest coverage ratio for the last twelve month period ended december  was approximately times compared to the debt covenant requirement of times interest coverage ratio is calculated as net income plus interest expense and provision for income taxes  less equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries  divided by interest expense 
the leverage ratio at december  calculated in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement was compared to the debt covenant maximum amount of leverage ratio is calculated as total debt  inclusive of capital lease obligations and outstanding letters of credit on our billion revolving credit facility  divided by shareholders equity plus total debt 
the minimum net worth requirement at december  was million compared to the consolidated shareholders equity balance of billion at december  all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  which constitute the substantial majority of our subsidiaries  guarantee the borrowings under our billion revolving credit facility  the term loan and our private placement notes 
the requirement with respect to the subsidiary guarantors is that they collectively account for at least of consolidated ebitda and of consolidated tangible assets 
reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately of our total consolidated ebitda and approximately of total consolidated tangible assets 
the company was in compliance with all additional debt covenants at december  capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million for the year 
our capital expenditures are currently budgeted at approximately million  excluding acquisitions 
our budget includes several growth initiatives to expand or relocate existing facilities and to add or upgrade equipment 
any capital expenditure commitments that existed at december  are included in the below table of contractual obligations 
our capital and operating lease commitments are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and are also included in the contractual obligations table below 
our capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  debt repayments and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and materials handling and processing equipment 
on february   our board of directors declared a increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to 
per share of common stock 
in may  our board of directors amended and restated our stock repurchase program authorizing up to an additional million shares of our common stock to be repurchased 
repurchased shares are treated as authorized but unissued shares 
in  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share under our stock repurchase plan 
in early  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average cost per share of 
this was the first time that we had repurchased our stock since as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under the plan at an average cost of per share and had approximately million shares authorized for purchase under the stock repurchase plan 
we believe such purchases  given appropriate circumstances  enhance shareholder value and reflect our confidence in the long term growth potential of our company 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options during were million 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations and funds available under our billion credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and senior debt repayment needs in the near term 
we have currently suspended acquisition activity until such time that we believe the business climate and credit markets will support such growth 
our primary use of cash in the near term will be to further reduce our debt levels to increase liquidity 
we expect to continue our acquisition and other growth activities in the future and anticipate that we will be able to fund such activities with borrowings under our line of credit and will not be required to access the financial markets 
our revolving credit facility can be increased from billion to billion upon approval of the lenders 
furthermore  based on our current capital structure and the existing provisions in our revolving credit facility agreement as amended on august   we may incur an additional million of debt outside of our bank group 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles 
payments due by year in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations estimated interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total interest is estimated using applicable rates at december  for our outstanding fixed and variable rate debt based on their respective scheduled maturities 
the majority of our inventory purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace materials 
includes the estimated benefit payments or contribution amounts for the company s defined benefit pension plans and serp plans for the next ten years 
these amounts are limited to the information provided by our actuaries 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods 
in addition  some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
therefore  agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace materials 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality some of our customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products  resulting from vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to billion at december   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas or statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs  making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance 
we test for impairment of goodwill by calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method 
under this method  the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment 
projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which considers both returns to equity and debt investors 
we perform the required annual goodwill impairment evaluation on november of each year 
no impairment of goodwill was determined to exist for the years ended december   or impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
future events and the current changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to commodity prices  demand and future growth rates or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe the assumptions used in testing for impairment are reasonable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
additionally  further declines in the market conditions for our products as well as in the price of our common stock could also significantly impact our impairment analysis 
an impairment charge  if incurred  could be material 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on an evaluation of specific potential customer risks 
assessments are based on legal issues such as bankruptcy status  our past collection history  and current financial and credit agency reports along with current economic pressures impacting that customer or industry 
accounts which we determine to be uncollectible are reserved for or written off in the period in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on our historical and probable future bad debt experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents inventories a significant portion of our inventory is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
under this method  older costs are included in inventory  which may be higher or lower than current costs 
this method of valuation is subject to year to year fluctuations in cost of material sold  which is influenced by the inflation or deflation existing within the metals industry as well as fluctuations in our product mix and on hand inventory levels 
at december  cost on the first in  first out fifo method exceeds our lifo value of inventories by million 
the calculation of lifo does not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
furthermore  considering that our current inventory values as reflected in our financial statements on a lifo basis are significantly below fifo costs  valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market is also not subject to significant estimates or judgments 
however  we do maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
for information regarding our provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions  changes in our assessment of tax exposure items  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we estimate the reporting unit s fair value based on a discounted future cash flow approach that requires us to estimate income from operations based on historical results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies 
we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
the reconciliation includes such factors as historical and industry multiples  industry performance statistics  and recent comparable transaction pricing among other information 
a key assumption made is that  in general  business activity will be lower in than in and will recover somewhat in after that time we anticipate that our revenues will grow at to per year 
if these estimates or their related assumptions for commodity prices and demand change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impact of recently issued accounting standards please refer to the note of the notes to consolidated financial statement for discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting standards 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
commodity price risk metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
because we primarily purchase and sell in the spot market we are able to react quickly to changes in metals pricing 
this strategy also limits our exposure to commodity prices to our inventories on hand which can range from to months of supply 
in an environment of increasing material costs our pricing usually increases as we try to maintain the same gross profit percentage and typically generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
in periods where demand deteriorates rapidly and metal prices are declining significantly in a compressed period of time  such as during the last three months of  our inventory on hand may be at higher costs than our selling prices  causing a significant adverse effect on our gross profit and pre tax income margins 
however  when prices stabilize and our inventories on hand reflect more current prices  our earnings tend to return to more normalized levels 
foreign exchange rate risk because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
volatility in these markets could impact our net income 
foreign currency transaction losses were approximately million during primarily related to our canadian operations and the strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar during the exposure to foreign currency rates in relation to our canadian operations was limited to certain outstanding intercompany borrowings denominated in the us dollar which were not hedged 
this exposure was significantly reduced during as the related balances were paid off 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we do not currently anticipate repayment of our fixed rate long term debt prior to its scheduled maturities 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pretax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
at december   our total variable interest rate debt outstanding amounted to approximately million which was primarily comprised of the borrowings on our revolving credit facility of million and million senior unsecured term loan 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in an additional million of interest expense on an annual basis
