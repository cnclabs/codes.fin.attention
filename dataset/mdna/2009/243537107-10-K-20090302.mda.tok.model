we sell our brands through our quality domestic retailers and international distributors and directly to our end user consumers through our ecommerce business and our retail stores 
we sell our footwear in 
table of contents both the domestic market and in international markets 
independent third parties manufacture all of our products 
our business has been impacted by several important trends recent changes in us and global economic conditions have adversely impacted businesses generally  some of our customers may be adversely affected  which in turn may adversely impact our financial results 
the markets for casual  outdoor and athletic footwear have grown significantly during the last decade 
we believe this growth is a result of the trend toward casual dress in the workplace  increasingly active outdoor lifestyles and a growing emphasis on comfort 
consumers are more often seeking footwear designed to address a broader array of activities with the same quality  comfort and high performance attributes they have come to expect from traditional athletic footwear 
our customers have narrowed their footwear product breadth  focusing on brands with a rich heritage and authenticity as market category creators and leaders 
consumers have become increasingly focused on luxury and comfort  seeking out products and brands that are fashionable while still comfortable 
there is an emerging sustainable lifestyle movement happening all around the world 
consumers are demanding that brands and companies take a more responsible approach when it comes to protecting the environment 
by emphasizing our brands images and our focus on comfort  performance and authenticity  we believe we can maintain a loyal consumer following that is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by changing fashions and changes in consumer preferences 
below is an overview of the various components of our business  including some of the important factors that affect each business and some of our strategies for growing each business 
ugg brand overview the ugg brand has become a well known brand throughout the country as well as internationally 
over the past several years  our ugg brand has received increased media exposure including increased print media in national ads and cooperative advertising with our customers  which has contributed to broader public awareness of the ugg brand and significantly increased demand for the collection 
we believe that the increased media focus and demand for ugg products were driven by the following consumer brand loyalty  due to the luxury and comfort of ugg footwear  increased marketing in high end magazines  successful targeting of high end distribution  adoption by high profile film and television celebrities as a favored footwear brand  increased media attention that has enabled us to introduce the brand to consumers much faster than we would have otherwise been able to  increased exposure to the brand driven by our concept stores which showcase all of our product offerings  continued geographic expansion across the us and internationally  and continued innovation of new product categories and styles 

table of contents we believe the luxury and comfort features of ugg products will continue to drive long term consumer demand 
recognizing that there is a significant fashion element to ugg footwear and that footwear fashions fluctuate  our strategy seeks to prolong the longevity of the brand by offering a broader product line suitable for wear in a variety of climates and occasions and by limiting distribution to selected higher end retailers 
as part of this strategy we have increased our product offering  including a growing spring line  an expanded men s line  as well as a fall line that consists of a range of luxurious collections for both genders 
these collections include new fashion collections  a variety of casual comfort collections  and cold weather offerings  as well as our classic  ultra  ultimate and slippers collections 
for the year ended december   the ugg brand s wholesale net sales increased  and the ugg brand s net sales including wholesale  ecommerce and retail store sales increased by approximately  compared to the same period in we cannot assure investors that ugg brand sales will continue to grow at their recent pace or that revenue from ugg products will not at some point decline 
teva brand overview we continue to see a significant shift in consumer preferences and lifestyles to include more outdoor recreational activities 
because of our long history with outdoor footwear  as well as our continued commitment to performance and lifestyle product innovation  the teva brand has remained popular with outdoor athletes and enthusiasts  and is poised to capture new outdoor consumers entering the market 
our spring and fall product lines include a mix of core performance product evolutions and new lifestyle product introductions 
beginning with the introduction of our first fully complete closed toe footwear collection in fall  we have begun to reduce our reliance on sandal sales and optimal spring weather 
we intend to continue to explore opportunities to broaden the teva brand s distribution with quality  image enhancing retailers both within and beyond the core outdoor specialty and sporting goods channels 
through effective channel management and product line segmentation  we plan to expand into new distribution channels without diluting our outdoor heritage and our appeal to outdoor enthusiasts 
through appropriate channel product line expansion  we plan to broaden our product offerings to meet the performance and lifestyle needs of today s outdoor consumer 
however  we cannot assure investors that these efforts will be successful 
because impairment indicators arose  we conducted an interim impairment evaluation of the teva goodwill and trademarks as of june  and concluded that the teva goodwill was not impaired  but the fair value of the teva trademarks was lower than the carrying amount 
therefore  we recognized an impairment loss of  on the teva trademarks during the three months ended june  in addition  we conducted our annual impairment test as of december  and concluded that the fair values of both the teva trademarks and goodwill were lower than their respective carrying amounts 
therefore  we recognized an additional impairment loss of  on the teva trademarks and  on the teva goodwill  which was the entire balance of our teva goodwill  in the fourth quarter of the total impairment loss for is included as a separate line item in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  for further discussion on the impairment evaluation  see results of operations impairment loss and critical accounting policies and estimates below

for the year ended december   wholesale net sales of simple products increased by approximately  and net sales of simple products including wholesale  ecommerce and retail store sales increased by approximately  compared to the same period in we expect simple brand growth including wholesale  ecommerce and retail store sales  to be higher year over year in compared to tsubo brand overview in may  we acquired of the ownership interest of tsubo  llc tsubo 
tsubo  meaning pressure point in japanese  was a company co founded by a british designer in the tsubo brand was marketed as a high end casual footwear company with products for men and women

we believe that the tsubo brand represents an ideal complement to our portfolio of lifestyle brands 
the tsubo brand s target consumer  product selection  industry niche and relative under penetration in the marketplace make it a good fit for our business model 
in addition  the tsubo brand s commitment to quality distribution and its unique performance comfort platform allow us to develop a compelling brand story for the global marketplace 
we intend to leverage our existing design  marketing and distribution capabilities to grow the tsubo brand into a meaningful business over the next few years  consistent with our mission to build niche brands into global market leaders 
nevertheless  we cannot assure investors that our efforts will be successful 
we conducted our annual impairment evaluation of the tsubo goodwill and other intangible assets using market value approaches and valuation techniques as of december  we concluded that the 
table of contents fair value of the tsubo trademarks was not impaired  but due to the decline in our market capitalization  as discussed above  we concluded that the fair value of our tsubo reporting unit was below its carrying amount 
therefore  we recognized an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of of  on the tsubo goodwill  which was the entire balance of our tsubo goodwill 
the total impairment loss for is included as a separate line item in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 
ecommerce overview our ecommerce business  which sells all of our brands  enables us to meet the growing demand for these products  to sell the products at retail prices and to provide us with significant incremental operating income 
the ecommerce business enables us to interact and reinforce our relationships with the consumer 
our teva and ugg australia websites both won bizrate s circle of excellence platinum awards for both and the award recognizes online retailers with top customer satisfaction ratings 
in recent years  our ecommerce business has had significant revenue growth  much of which occurred as the ugg brand gained popularity and as consumers have continued to increase usage of the internet for footwear and other purchases 
net sales of the ecommerce business increased in the year ended december   compared to the same period in as our annual baseline of ecommerce sales increases  we do not expect this growth rate to continue 
managing our ecommerce business requires us to focus on the latest trends and techniques for web design  to generating internet traffic to our websites  to effectively convert website visits into orders  and to maximize average order sizes 
we plan to continue to grow our internet business through improved website features and performance  increased marketing and international websites 
overall  our ecommerce business benefits from the strength of our brands and  as we grow our brands over time  we expect this division to continue to be an important segment of our business 
nevertheless  we cannot assure investors that ecommerce sales will continue to grow at their recent pace or that revenue from our ecommerce business will not at some point decline 
retail stores overview based upon the success of our existing ugg australia concept stores in chicago and the soho area of new york city  we opened our first west coast ugg australia concept store in august in san francisco near union square 
in november  we opened our second new york city ugg australia concept store near lincoln square as well as our sixth retail outlet store in new jersey 
during  we opened our first company owned stores internationally 
in the united kingdom  we opened two ugg australia concept stores  the first in the new westfield mall in white city in october and the second in covent garden in london in november 
in july  we entered into a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of stella international holdings limited stella international for the opening of retail stores and wholesale distribution for the ugg brand in china 
under this agreement  we opened our first ugg australia concept store in beijing in december 
the joint venture is owned by deckers and by stella international 
the total initial investment in the joint venture was  contributed by both parties in proportion to their respective ownership in the joint venture 
the estimated total investment by deckers and stella international  including contributed capital and loans  for the joint venture is expected to be approximately  our retail stores enable us to directly impact our customers experience  meet the growing demand for these products  sell the products at retail prices and provide us with incremental annual operating income 
in addition  our ugg australia concept stores allow us to showcase our entire line  where a retailer may not carry the whole line 
net sales of the retail store business increased in the year ended december   compared to the same period in we do not expect this growth rate to continue 
table of contents because as we increase the number of our stores  each new store will have less proportional impact on our growth rate 
for those stores that were open during the full year of and  same store sales grew by 
nevertheless  we cannot assure investors that retail store sales will continue to grow at their recent pace or that revenue from our retail store business will not at some point decline 
seasonality our business is seasonal  with the highest percentage of ugg brand net sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters  and the highest percentage of teva brand net sales occurring in the first and second quarters of each year 
to date  the simple brand has not had a seasonal impact on the company 
similarly  we do not expect the tsubo brand to have a seasonal impact 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales income from operations first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales income loss from operations included in income loss from operations in the second quarter of is a  impairment loss on our teva trademarks 
included in the fourth quarter of is a  impairment loss on our teva trademarks  teva goodwill  and tsubo goodwill 
with the dramatic growth in the ugg brand in recent years  combined with the introduction of a fall teva product line  net sales in the last half of the year have exceeded that for the first half of the year 
given our expectations for each of our brands in  we currently expect this trend to continue 
nonetheless  actual results could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product  competition and our customers continuing to carry and promote our various product lines  among other risks and uncertainties

international sales for all of our products increased by  or  in compared to  representing of net sales in and of net sales in the majority of the international sales growth was due to increases in ugg and simple brand sales  as well as our retail stores that opened in the largest increase in international sales comes from our ugg brand sales  led by the european region

table of contents income tax uncertainties due to settlements during that were previously accrued  and in  we incurred interest expense related to certain tax matters in the far east 
income taxes 
in  our effective income tax rate was versus an effective income tax rate of in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the company s international sales as a percentage of total worldwide sales 
the company s average international tax rate is significantly less than the company s us rate  and therefore a higher ratio of international sales and international pre tax income decreases the company s overall effective tax rate 
this decrease was partially offset by approximately  of impairment losses in attributable to a foreign subsidiary that receives no tax benefit from the charge  as this subsidiary is in a tax free jurisdiction 
for  we expect a further reduction in our effective tax rate as a result of the completion of buy in payments for our intellectual property rights  which were taxable in the us at the higher tax rate 
in and  these buy in payments resulted in an increase in the company s us pre tax income and a decrease in the company s international pre tax income

for a discussion of other off balance sheet arrangements  see contractual obligations below 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our working capital and operating needs using a combination of our cash and cash equivalents balances  short term investments  cash generated from operations and as needed  the credit availability under our revolving credit facility 
in an economic recession or under other adverse economic conditions  we may be unable to realize a return on our cash equivalents and short term investments or to secure additional credit on favorable terms 
such failures may impact our working capital reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business 
see part i  item a  risk factors for more discussion of this issue 
the seasonality of our business requires us to build inventory levels in anticipation of the sales for the coming season 
the teva brand generally begins to build inventory levels beginning in the fourth quarter and first quarter in anticipation of the spring selling season that occurs in the first and second quarters  
table of contents whereas the ugg brand generally builds its inventories in the second and third quarters to support sales for the fall and winter selling seasons  which historically occur during the third and fourth quarters 
our cash flow cycle includes the purchase of these inventories  the subsequent sale of the inventories and the eventual collection of the resulting accounts receivable 
as a result  our working capital requirements begin when we purchase the inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting receivables 
given the seasonality of our teva and ugg brands  our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
the cash required to fund these working capital fluctuations is generally provided using our internal cash flows 
if necessary  we may borrow funds under our revolving credit facility 
during   and  we did not borrow funds under our revolving credit facility 
cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a greater increase in inventory and accounts receivable as well as a lower increase in accounts payable in compared to the lower increase in inventory was primarily due to higher anticipated ugg sales in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of the larger increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in the lower increase in trade accounts payable was primarily due to timing of cash payments near the end of compared to these changes were partially offset by the higher net income excluding the impairment loss on intangible assets of  and the increase in long term liabilities 
the long term liabilities are primarily attributable to deferred rent 
net working capital improved by  to  as of december  from  as of december   primarily as a result of the higher inventory and accounts receivable balances 
the increase in working capital was partially offset by higher other accrued expenses  income taxes payable  and trade accounts payable 
the changes in working capital are due to our normal seasonality and timing of cash receipts and cash payments 
cash from investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in which was comprised primarily of net sales of short term investments  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and our acquisition of tsubo  llc 
our capital expenditures were primarily related to a new inventory pick module in our distribution center  leasehold improvements for new retail stores  and computer hardware and software 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was  which was comprised primarily of the net purchases of short term investments 
in addition  we used  for capital expenditures  primarily related to the build out of our new retail stores  the replacement and upgrading of certain computer equipment and additional warehouse equipment 
cash from financing activities 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was  consisting of the excess tax benefits from shared based compensation as well as the contribution from our new joint venture partner and cash received from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by cash paid for shares withheld for taxes 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was  consisting of the excess tax benefits from share based compensation as well as cash received from the exercise of stock options 
the amount of excess tax benefits decreased significantly from due to the exercise of fewer stock options during our working capital consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  inventories and trade accounts payable 
at december   working capital was  including  of cash and cash equivalents and  of short term investments 
trade accounts receivable increased by to  at december  from  at december  primarily due to higher net sales in the latter part of compared to the latter part of accounts receivable turnover increased to times in the twelve months ended december  from times in the twelve months ended december   primarily as a result of increased sales and faster collections in compared to due to the continued increased demand for ugg product in  
table of contents which encouraged retailers to pay their receivables balances faster in efforts to receive their upcoming deliveries more quickly 
inventories increased by  or  at december  compared to december   reflecting a   and  increase in ugg  simple  and tsubo brand inventory  respectively  and a  decrease in teva brand inventory 
overall  inventory turnover decreased to times for the year ended december  from times for the year ended december   largely due to the slightly higher rate of increase on our average inventory than our sales during the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  this was due to the expansion of our warehouse and our ability to hold more inventory for the coming seasons  as well as the increase in our landed costs compared to last year 
our revolving credit facility with comerica bank the facility provides for a maximum availability of  up to  of borrowings may be in the form of letters of credit 
the facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate at december  or  at our option  at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  at december  plus to  depending on our ratio of liabilities to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the facility includes annual commitment fees of per year and expires on june  at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility and outstanding letters of credit of as a result   was available under the facility at december  the agreements underlying the facility contain certain financial covenants  currently including a limitation on aggregate annual lease payments of  a quick ratio requirement of at least  a minimum profitability requirement of  per fiscal quarter  a limitation on annual consolidated capital expenditures of  a minimum tangible net worth requirement of  commencing with the fiscal year ended december   plus of consolidated net profit on a cumulative basis  and a requirement that our consolidated total liabilities to consolidated effective tangible net worth ratio be greater than 
the agreements also contain a prohibition on the payment of dividends 
due to the impairment loss and resulting loss from operations in the second quarter  we were in default because we had less than  of net income for the three months ended june  we agreed with comerica bank to execute a waiver through june  of this technical default 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants and remain so as of the date of this report 
as of december   we had no material commitments for future capital expenditures  but we estimate that the capital expenditures for will range from approximately  to  and anticipate those will include the build out of international and corporate offices  miscellaneous computer hardware and software  and the build out of new retail stores 
the actual amount of capital expenditures for may differ from this estimate  largely depending on any unforeseen needs to replace existing assets and the timing of expenditures 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap unrecognized tax benefits total our operating lease obligations consist primarily of building leases for our corporate and regional offices  distribution centers  and retail locations 
our purchase obligations consist largely of purchase 
table of contents orders  as well as promotional expenses and service contracts 
outstanding purchase orders are primarily with our third party manufacturers and are expected to be paid within one year 
these are outstanding open orders and not minimum obligations  we had no minimum purchase requirement with any of our factories as of december  our promotional expenditures and service contracts are due periodically through total other long term liabilities is  and the short term portion of these long term liabilities is  which consists primarily of deferred rents 
the unrecognized tax benefits are related to uncertain tax positions taken in our income tax return that would impact the effective tax rate  if recognized 
in addition to the amounts in the table above  we have entered into other off balance sheet arrangements 
we agreed to make loans to our joint venture with stella international  should the need arise 
the estimated total loans by deckers and stella international is expected to be approximately  contributed by both parties in proportion to their respective ownership in the joint venture 
we also have potential future earn out payments relating to our may acquisition of tsubo  llc 
the potential earn out is based on the amount  if any  that sales of tsubo products exceed certain base revenue levels for each year from to see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
these amounts were excluded from the table above as the total payments were not known at the time of the acquisition since they are based on future revenue 
at december   we did not accrue any earn out payments for subsequent to december   we entered into a contract requiring minimum purchase commitments of sheepskin of approximately  that deckers affiliates  manufacturers  factories and other agents each or collectively  a buyer must make on or before december  this contract may result in an unconditional purchase obligation  if a buyer does not meet the minimum purchase requirements 
in the event that a buyer does not purchase such minimum commitments on or before december   deckers is required to purchase any remaining amounts on or before december  our sheepskin purchases by third party factories supplying ugg product to us during and exceeded this minimum purchase commitment  and we expect such purchases will exceed these levels in and therefore  we do not anticipate having to make any payments under this contractual arrangement  however we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments will occur 
we believe this will not materially affect our liquidity or results of operations  as it is in the normal course of our business 
we believe that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under our existing facility  cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our current and foreseeable working capital requirements 
however  risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to maintain our cash position include our growth rate  the continued strength of our brands  our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences  our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  our ability to effectively manage our inventories  the availability of short term credit  and market volatility  among others 
see part i  item a  risk factors for a discussion of additional factors that may affect our working capital position 
furthermore  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirement  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a new credit facility or draw on our existing facility 
the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in incurring debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
although there are no other material present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of any other businesses  we may evaluate acquisitions of other businesses or brands 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain tax obligations to authorities in china for one of the company s foreign subsidiaries 

table of contents impact of inflation we believe that the rates of inflation in the three most recent fiscal years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowances for estimated returns  discounts  chargebacks  and bad debts are provided for when related revenue is recorded 
amounts billed for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of net sales  while the related costs paid to third party shipping companies are recorded as a cost of sales 
we present revenue net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures about contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience  existing  known circumstances  authoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable 
management reasonably could use different estimates and assumptions  and changes in estimates and assumptions could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a potential material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically been materially accurate in our estimates used for the reserves and allowances below 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged trade accounts receivables  economic conditions  historical experience and the customers credit worthiness 
trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
the reserve includes specific reserves for accounts  which are identified as potentially uncollectible  plus a non specific reserve for the balance of accounts based on our historical loss experience with bad debts 
reserves have been established for all probable losses of this nature 
the gross trade accounts receivable balance was  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december   compared to gross trade accounts receivable of  and allowance for doubtful accounts of at december  the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  compared to december  was primarily due to downgrading the collectability of several accounts due to current economic conditions  which increased the reserve percentage applied to those accounts 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts we consider to have credit risk and are not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by approximately reserve for sales discounts 
a significant portion of our domestic net sales and resulting trade accounts receivable reflects a discount that the customers may take  generally based upon meeting certain order  shipment and payment timelines 
we estimate the amount of the discounts that are available to be taken against the period end trade accounts receivable  and we record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts 
the reserve for sales discounts was approximately  or of gross accounts receivable  at december  and  or of gross accounts receivable  at december  the slight decrease in the reserve as a percentage of gross accounts receivable was primarily due to a lower percentage of total outstanding customer balances being eligible for terms discounts 
our use of different 
table of contents estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example a change in the estimate of the percentage of accounts that will ultimately take their discount would change the reserve for sales discounts at december  by approximately allowance for estimated returns 
we record an allowance for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to period end 
in general  we accept returns for damaged or defective products but discourage returns for other reasons 
we base the amount of the allowance on any approved customer requests for returns  historical returns experience and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns rates  among other factors 
the allowance for returns was  or of gross accounts receivable  at december  and  or of gross accounts receivable  at december  the decrease in the allowance was primarily due to a change in classification of the reserve for consumer direct returns 
at december   we included these reserves in net accounts receivable  but in  we reclassified the consumer direct returns to other accrued expenses within current liabilities  as the related businesses do not carry accounts receivable 
in addition  the decrease in our wholesale reserve for returns was due to a reduction in the timing estimate for damaged product returns 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the reserve for returns at december  by approximately  allowance for estimated chargebacks 
when our customers pay their invoices  they often take deductions for chargebacks against their invoices  which we seldom recover 
therefore  we record an allowance for the balance of chargebacks that are outstanding in our accounts receivable balance as of the end of each quarter  along with an estimated reserve for chargebacks that have not yet been taken against outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate is based on historical trends of the timing of chargebacks taken against invoices 
the allowance for chargebacks was  at december  and  at december  the increase in the allowance was primarily due to the increase of trade accounts receivable at december  compared to december  inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review the various items in inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete  and impaired inventory 
in doing so  we write the inventory down to the lower of cost or estimated future net selling prices 
at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  the slight increase in inventory write downs at december  compared to december  was primarily due to new inventory write downs during  primarily in our teva and simple brand inventories 
this was partially offset by the sale of inventory that had been previously written down at december  our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write down reserve at december  by approximately valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we assess the impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets on a separate asset basis based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying amount of these assets individually 
we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based on the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill and the fair value of the assets for nonamortizable intangibles compared to their respective carrying value 
we consider other long lived assets to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
among other considerations  we consider the following factors the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  any changes in legal ownership of rights to the assets  and 
table of contents changes in consumer demand or acceptance of the related brand names  products or features associated with the assets 
if we determine the assets to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
in addition  as it relates to long lived assets  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on the estimate of the period that the assets will generate sales or otherwise be used by us 
on december   we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets using market value approaches and valuation techniques and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets as of december  as of june   our inability to reach our teva brand period to date sales targets along with a reduced long term forecast for teva brand sales growth were indicators that the teva goodwill and other intangible assets were possibly impaired 
as a result  we conducted an interim impairment evaluation of the teva goodwill and other intangible assets as of june  and concluded that the teva goodwill was not impaired  but the fair value of the teva trademarks was lower than the carrying amount 
therefore  we recognized an impairment loss of  in the second quarter on the teva trademarks 
as of december   due in part to the continued decline in the economy in the second half of  we reduced our long term teva brand sales forecast 
in addition  as of december   we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization due to declines in market multiples 
as a result of the reduced sales forecast and the decline in market capitalization  we concluded that the fair value of our teva trademarks and teva goodwill were below their respective carrying amounts 
further  due to the decline in our market capitalization  we concluded that the fair value of our tsubo goodwill was also below its carrying amount 
therefore  we recognized an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of  on our teva trademarks and  on our goodwill  which was the entire balance of both our teva and tsubo goodwill 
the impairment loss is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the annual impairment testing date is still december of each year  however  management will perform an interim test of recoverability should facts and circumstances warrant 
such facts and circumstances could include further deterioration of general economic conditions or the retail environment  customers reducing orders in response to such conditions and increased competition 
these or other factors could result in impairment of our remaining goodwill and other intangible assets 
our use of different estimates including estimated royalty rates  discount rates  market multiples  and future revenues  among others and assumptions could produce different financial results 
after all impairment charges recorded during  the remaining balances of goodwill and nonamortizable intangibles by brand are as follows as of december  ugg teva tsubo total trademarks goodwill total nonamortizable intangibles share based compensation expense 
financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r requires that share based payment transactions with employees be accounted for using the fair value method and expensed ratably over the vesting period of the award 
share based compensation expense is based on the fair values of all share based awards as of the grant date 
determining the expense of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the percentage of awards that will be forfeited  probabilities of meeting criteria for performance based awards  stock volatility  the expected life of the award  and other inputs 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
sfas standardizes the definition and approaches for fair value measurements of financial instruments for those standards which already permit or require the use of fair value 
it does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas defines a hierarchy for valuation techniques and also requires additional disclosures 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
fasb staff position fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
delays the effective date of sfas only as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after november  in accordance with fsp fas  we have not applied sfas to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities  mainly intangible assets and property and equipment 
on january   we will be required to apply the provisions of sfas to fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  of applying these provisions on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised sfas r  business combinations 
the objective of sfas r is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
sfas r requires that all business combinations be accounted for by applying the acquisition method previously referred to as the purchase method  and most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in business combinations to be recorded at full fair value 
sfas r also broadens the definition of a business and changes the treatment of direct acquisition related costs from being included in the purchase price to instead being generally expensed if they are not costs associated with issuing debt or equity securities 
sfas r is effective for us beginning january   and will be applied prospectively to any new business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
the objective of sfas is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas specifies that noncontrolling interests referred to as minority interests prior to sfas be reported as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other item outside of equity  which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
sfas is effective for us beginning january   and will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests  including our current minority interest and any others that arose before that date 
in march  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
the objective of sfas is to improve the transparency of financial reporting by requiring additional disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for us beginning january   with early application encouraged 
this statement encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
we will apply this statement prospectively to any derivative and hedging activities entered into on or after the effective date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
although we have used foreign currency hedges in the past  we currently do not utilize forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the foreign 
table of contents currency exchange rate  as the majority of our purchases and sales for the foreseeable future will be denominated in us currency 
as our international operations grow and we increase purchases and sales in foreign currencies  we will evaluate and utilize derivative instruments  as needed  to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
although our sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us currency  our sales and inventory purchases may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in the international markets where our products are sold and manufactured 
if the us dollar strengthens  it may result in increased pricing pressure on our distributors  which may have a negative impact on our net sales and gross margins 
we are unable to estimate the amount of any impact on sales and gross margins attributed to pricing pressures caused by fluctuations in exchange rates 
market risk 
our market risk exposure with respect to financial instruments is to changes in the prime rate in the us and changes in libor 
our revolving line of credit provides for interest on outstanding borrowings at rates tied to the prime rate or at our election tied to libor 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
a increase in interest rates on our current borrowings would have no impact on income before income taxes 
we face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our foreign assets and liabilities 
we manage these risks by attempting to denominate contractual and other foreign arrangements in us dollars and by maintaining a significant percentage of our liabilities in us dollars 
we do not believe that there has been a material change in the nature of our primary market risk exposures  including the categories of market risk to which we are exposed and the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we do not know of or expect there to be any material change in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term
