item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors  including the factors we describe under item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading  pure play provider of broadband telephone services to residential and small office and home office customers with over million subscriber lines as of december  while customers in the united states represented of our subscriber lines in  we continue to serve customers internationally with services in canada and the united kingdom 
our service is portable and we enable our customers to make and receive phone calls with a telephone almost anywhere a broadband internet connection is available 
we transmit these calls using voice over internet protocol  or voip  technology  which converts voice signals into digital data packets for transmission over the internet 
at a cost effective rate  each of our calling plans provides a number of basic features typically offered by traditional telephone service providers  plus a wide range of enhanced features that we believe differentiate our service and offer an attractive value proposition to our customers 
we also offer a number of premium services for additional costs 
vonage has developed both a direct sales channel  as represented by web sites and toll free numbers  and a retail distribution channel through national retailers including best buy and wal mart 
the direct and retail distribution channels are supported through highly integrated advertising campaigns across multiple media such as online  television  direct mail  alternative media  telemarketing  partner marketing and customer referral programs 
our primary source of revenue is subscription fees that we charge customers for our service plans  primarily on a monthly basis 
we also generate revenue from the sale of devices that connect a customer s phone to the internet  for international calls customers make that are not included in their service plan  for additional features that customers add to their service plans and through activation fees we charge customers to activate their service 
trends in our industry and key operating data a number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements 
also  the table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of our business for the years ended december  gross subscriber line additions net subscriber line additions subscriber lines at period end average monthly customer churn average monthly revenue per line average monthly telephony services revenue per line average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line marketing costs per gross subscriber line addition employees excluding temporary help at period end broadband adoption 
the number of us households with broadband internet access has grown significantly 
we expect this trend to continue 
we benefit from this trend because our service requires a broadband internet connection and our potential addressable market increases as broadband adoption increases 
changing competitive landscape 
we are facing increasing competition from other companies that offer multiple services such as cable television  video services  voice and broadband internet service 
these competitors are offering voip or other voice services as part of a bundle  in which they offer voice services at a lower price than we do to new subscribers 
in addition  we believe several of these competitors are working to develop new integrated offerings that we cannot provide and that could make their services more attractive to customers 
for example  as wireless providers offer more minutes at lower prices and companion landline alternative services  their services have become more attractive to households as a replacement for wireline service 
we also compete against established alternative voice communication providers and independent voip service providers 
some of these service providers may choose to sacrifice revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at lower prices or for free 
gross subscriber line additions 
gross subscriber line additions for a particular period are calculated by taking the net subscriber line additions during that particular period and adding to that the number of subscriber lines that terminated during that period 
this number does not include subscriber lines both added and terminated during the period  where termination occurred 
table of contents within the first days after activation 
the number does include  however  subscriber lines added during the period that are terminated within days of activation but after the end of the period 
net subscriber line additions 
net subscriber line additions for a particular period reflect the number of subscriber lines at the end of the period  less the number of subscriber lines at the beginning of the period 
subscriber lines 
our subscriber lines include  as of a particular date  all subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date 
our subscriber lines include fax lines and softphones but do not include our virtual phone numbers or toll free numbers  which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers 
in  we added  net subscriber lines and had a total of  subscriber lines as of december  in the fourth quarter of  we had a net loss of  subscriber lines 
average monthly customer churn 
average monthly customer churn for a particular period is calculated by dividing the number of customers that terminated during that period by the simple average number of customers during the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period  plus the number of customers on the last day of the period  divided by two 
terminations  as used in the calculation of churn statistics  do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first days after activation 
our average monthly customer churn was for compared to for we believe this increase was driven  in part  by inconsistent user experience with our service  quality of our service  increased competition and the impact of worsening economic conditions 
in the fourth quarter of  our average monthly customer churn was 
as part of our effort to improve customer satisfaction and increase retention  in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  we extended our customer grace period for non payment in order to better resolve customer accounts that may be past due 
these extensions had a one time positive impact of basis points and basis points on our average monthly customer churn for the fourth quarter and the second quarter  respectively 
we did not extend our customer grace period in we monitor churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction 
other companies may calculate churn differently  and their churn data may not be directly comparable to ours 
customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a significantly lower churn rate than customers who have not 
our churn will fluctuate over time due to increased competitive pressures  market place perception of our services and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services 
average monthly revenue per line 
average monthly revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period  plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period  divided by two 
our average monthly revenue per line increased slightly to for compared to for  reflecting an increase in the dollar value of customer equipment sales including sales in the retail channel for replacement devices or upgrades that do not yield a new activation and a benefit from the reduction in the period over which activation fees are amortized partially offset by an increase in credits  promotions and bad debt 
while we continue to expect stability in our pricing environment  in the fourth quarter we increased the price of our residential basic offering to from 
customers on this plan represent roughly of total lines 
we believe we may see a minor increase in the level of customer churn for these plans once all customers receive their revised billing 
average monthly telephony services revenue per line 
average monthly telephony services revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total telephony services revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
our average monthly telephony services revenue per line was for compared with for due to an increase in credits including promotions and bad debt partially offset by a benefit from the reduction in the period over which activation fees are amortized 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our direct cost of telephony services for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
we use the average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line to evaluate how effective we are at managing our costs of providing service 
our average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line decreased from for to for  primarily due to lower termination costs in marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition is calculated by dividing our marketing expense for a particular period by the number of gross subscriber line additions during the period 
marketing expense does not include the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions  which are accounted for as an offset to revenues  or customer equipment subsidies  which are accounted for as direct cost of goods sold 
as a result  it does not represent the full cost to us of obtaining a new customer 
our marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition increased to for from in and to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of  primarily due to a reduction in gross subscriber line additions 
employees 
employees represent the number of personnel that are on our payroll and exclude temporary or outsourced labor 
regulation 
our business has developed in an environment largely free from regulation 
the united states and other countries  however  are examining how voip services should be regulated  and a number of initiatives could have an impact on our business 
for example  the fcc has concluded that wireline broadband internet access  such as dsl and internet access provided by cable companies  is an information service and is subject to lighter regulation than telecommunications services 
this order may give providers of wireline broadband internet access the right to discriminate against our services  charge their customers an extra fee to use our service or block our service 
more recently  however  the fcc found that a major cable vonage annual report 
table of contents operator s network management practices  which had the effect of degrading certain applications  were not allowed under the fcc s network neutrality policy statement 
we believe it is unlikely that such blocking or discrimination will occur on a widespread basis  but if it does it would have a material adverse effect on us 
other regulatory developments including state efforts to impose state telecommunications regulation on us and the fcc s proposed reforms for the intercarrier compensation and universal service funding systems may affect our business by increasing the taxes and regulatory fees we pay and our operating expenses  including legal and consulting fees  or requiring us to make significant capital expenditures 
operating revenues operating revenues consists of telephony services revenue and customer equipment and shipping revenue 
telephony services revenue 
substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenue 
in the united states  we offer three residential plans  residential premium unlimited  vonagepro and residential basic  and two small office and home office plans  small business unlimited and small business basic 
each of our unlimited plans offers unlimited domestic calling as well as unlimited calling to puerto rico  canada and selected european countries  subject to certain restrictions  and each of our basic plans offers a limited number of domestic calling minutes per month 
also  we currently offer international calling plans that are bundled with our residential premium unlimited plan where a customer can make calls to a chosen international region 
under our basic plans  we charge on a per minute basis when the number of domestic calling minutes included in the plan is exceeded for a particular month 
international calls except for calls to certain european countries under our unlimited plans and a variety of countries under international calling plans are charged on a per minute basis 
these per minute fees are not included in our monthly subscription fees 
we offer similar plans in canada and the united kingdom 
we derive most of our telephony services revenue from monthly subscription fees that we charge our customers under our service plans 
we also offer residential fax service  virtual phone numbers  toll free numbers and other services  for each of which we charge an additional monthly fee 
one business fax line is included with each of our two small office and home office plans  but we charge monthly fees for additional business fax lines 
we automatically charge these fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards and electronic check payments  or ecp  monthly in advance 
we also automatically charge the per minute fees not included in our monthly subscription fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards or ecp monthly in arrears unless they exceed a certain dollar threshold  in which case they are charged immediately 
by collecting monthly subscription fees in advance and certain other charges immediately after they are incurred  we are able to reduce the amount of accounts receivable that we have outstanding  thus allowing us to have lower working capital requirements 
collecting in this manner also helps us mitigate bad debt losses  which are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
if a customer s credit card  debit card or ecp is declined  we generally suspend international calling capabilities as well as the customer s ability to incur domestic usage charges in excess of their plan minutes 
historically  in most cases  we are able to correct the problem with the customer within the current monthly billing cycle 
if the customer s credit card  debit card or ecp could not be successfully processed during three billing cycles ie the current and two subsequent monthly billing cycles  we terminate the account 
we also generate revenue by charging a fee for activating service 
we charge an activation fee to our direct channel customers  or those customers who purchase equipment directly from us and to our retail channel customers  or customers who purchase equipment from retail stores 
in  for our direct channel customers  activation fees  together with the related customer acquisition amounts for equipment  were deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer relationship period of months 
in  for our retail channel customers  rebates and retailer commissions up to but not exceeding the activation fee  were also deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer relationship period of months 
starting january   due to the increase in churn  the customer relationship period was reduced to months for both the direct and retail channel 
the amortization of deferred customer equipment expense is recorded to direct cost of goods sold 
the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction to telephony services revenue 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense 
the impact of this change was not material to the consolidated results of operations 
for  the average customer relationship period will be further reduced to months based upon further analysis of historical trends 
in the united states  we charge regulatory recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray the costs associated with regulatory consulting and compliance as well as related litigation  e compliance and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services 
in addition  we charge customers federal universal service fund  or usf  and related fees  which fees we record as revenue 
prior to august   we accepted returns of customer equipment up to days 
from august  through january   customers had up to days to return equipment 
starting february   returns of customer equipment was reduced back to days 
for all subscribers who became our customers from july  to february   we charged a disconnect fee to customers who terminated their service within one year of activation 
for subscribers who became customers after february   we charge a disconnect fee to those customers who terminate their service within two years of activation 
disconnect fees are recorded as revenue and are recognized at the time the customer terminates service 
telephony services revenue is offset by the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions 
customer equipment and shipping revenue 
customer equipment and shipping revenue consists of revenue from sales of customer equipment to our wholesalers or directly to customers and retailers 
in addition  customer equipment and shipping revenue includes the fees that we charge our customers for shipping any equipment to them 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of direct cost of telephony services  royalties  direct cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expense  marketing expense and depreciation and amortization 

table of contents total direct cost of telephony services 
total direct cost of telephony services primarily consists of fees that we pay to third parties on an ongoing basis in order to provide our services 
these fees include access charges that we pay to other telephone companies to terminate domestic and international calls on the public switched telephone network 
these costs represented approximately and of our total direct cost of telephony services for and  respectively  with a portion of these payments ultimately being made to incumbent telephone companies 
when a vonage subscriber calls another vonage subscriber  we do not pay an access charge 
the cost of leasing internet transit services from multiple internet service providers 
this internet connectivity is used to carry voip session initiation signaling and packetized audio media between our subscribers and our regional data centers 
the cost of leasing from other telephone companies the telephone numbers that we provide to our customers 
we lease these telephone numbers on a monthly basis 
the cost of co locating our regional data connection point equipment in third party facilities owned by other telephone companies  internet service providers or co location facility providers 
the cost of providing local number portability  which allows customers to move their existing telephone numbers from another provider to our service

for the year ended december   we significantly reduced our loss from operations and generated positive operating cash flow 
our primary sources of funds have been proceeds from private placements of our preferred stock  private placements of convertible notes and borrowings under credit facilities  an initial public offering of our common stock  operating revenues and borrowings under notes payable from our principal stockholder and chairman  which were subsequently converted into shares of our preferred stock 
we have used these proceeds for working capital  funding operating losses  ip litigation settlements  repaying our prior convertible notes and other general corporate purposes 
although our net losses initially were driven primarily by start up costs and the cost of developing our technology  more recently our net losses have been driven by investments in marketing  settlement of our ip litigation and refinancing costs 
in addition to marketing  we plan to continue to invest in research and development  our network infrastructure and customer care 
in  we announced a plan seeking to balance growth with profitability 
we intend to continue to pursue growth because we believe it will position us as a strong competitor in the long term 
although we believe we will achieve profitability in the future  we ultimately may not be successful and we may never achieve profitability 
we believe that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will fund our operations for at least the next twelve months

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our financial statements 
the following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including the following those related to the average period of service to a customer the customer relationship period used to amortize deferred revenue and deferred customer acquisition costs associated with customer activation  the useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets  and assumptions used for the purpose of determining share based compensation using the black scholes option model model  and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable 
the key inputs for this model are stock price at valuation date  strike price for the option  the dividend yield  risk free interest rate  life of option in years and volatility 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available market information  appropriate valuation methodologies and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition operating revenues consist of telephony services revenues and customer equipment which enables our telephony services and shipping revenues 
the point in time at which revenues are recognized is determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenues  which are derived primarily from monthly subscription fees that customers are charged under our service plans 
we also derive telephony services revenues from per minute fees for international calls and for any calling minutes in excess of a customer s monthly plan limits 
monthly subscription fees are automatically charged to customers credit cards  debit cards or ecp in advance and are recognized over the following month when services are provided 
revenues generated from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans are recognized as services are provided  that is  as minutes are used  and are billed to a customer s credit cards  debit cards or ecp in arrears 
as a result of our multiple billing cycles each month  we estimate the amount of revenues earned from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily upon historical minutes and have been consistent with our actual results 
we also generate revenues by charging a fee for activating service 
customer activation fees  along with the related customer acquisition amounts for customer equipment in the direct channel and for rebates and retailer commissions in the retail channel up to but not exceeding the activation fee  are deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer relationship period 
the amortization of deferred customer equipment is recorded to direct cost of goods sold 
the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction to telephony services revenues 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense 
for and  the estimated customer relationship period was months 
for  due to the increase in churn  the customer relationship period was reduced to months 
in  the customer relationship period will be further reduced to months based upon further analysis of historical trends 
we also provide rebates to customers who purchase their customer equipment from retailers and satisfy minimum service period requirements 
these rebates in excess of activation fees are recorded as a reduction of revenues over the service period based upon the estimated number of customers that will ultimately earn and claim the rebates 
customer equipment and shipping revenues include sales to our retailers  who subsequently resell this customer equipment to customers 
revenues were reduced for payments to retailers and rebates to customers  who purchased their customer equipment through these retailers  to the extent of customer equipment and shipping revenues 
inventory inventory consists of the cost of customer equipment and is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the average cost method 
we provide an inventory allowance for customer equipment that has been returned by customers but may not be able to be re issued to new customers or returned to the manufacturer for credit 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on the assumption that we will not generate taxable income

under section of the internal revenue code  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period  the corporation s ability to use its pre change of control net operating loss carry forward and other pre change tax attributes against its post change income may be limited 
the section limitation is applied annually so as to limit the use of our pre change net operating loss carryforwards to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long term tax exempt rate 
in addition  we may be able to increase the base section limitation amount during the first five years following the ownership change to the extent it realizes built in gains during that time period 
a built in gain generally is gain or income attributable to an asset that was held at the date of the ownership change and that had a fair market value in excess of the tax basis at the date of the ownership change 
section provides that any unused section limitation amount can be carried forward and aggregated with the following year s available net operating losses 
due to the cumulative impact of our equity issuances over the three year period ended april  a change of ownership occurred upon the issuance of our previously outstanding series e preferred stock at the end of april as a result   of the total us net operating losses will be subject to an annual base limitation of  as noted above  we believe we may be able to increase the base section limitation for built in gains during the first five years following the ownership change

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign exchange risk our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the british pound  the euro and the canadian dollar 
our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency 
interest rate and debt risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt and to a lesser degree investments 
on october   we entered into definitive agreements for a financing consisting of i a  first lien senior facility  ii a  second lien senior facility and iii the sale of  of our convertible notes 
the funding for this transaction was completed on november  we are exposed to interest rate risk since amounts under the first lien senior facility  at our option  bear interest at the greater of and libor plus  in either case   payable on the last day of each relevant interest period or  if the interest period is longer than three months  each day that is three months after the first day of the interest period and the last day of such interest period  or the greater of and the higher of i the rate quoted in the wall street journal  money rates section as the prime rate as in effect from time to time and ii the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus plus  in either case   payable on the last day of each month in arrears 
the interest rate on the second lien senior facility and convertible notes are fixed 
as of december   if the interest rate on the company s variable rate debt changed by  the company s annual debt service payment would change by approximately  interest rate risk on investments was minimal since cash on hand at december  was primarily invested in money market funds 
historically  we invested in a variety of securities that consisted primarily of investments in interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations and municipalities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
during  due to the economic downturn in the banking industry and in anticipation of the use of cash on hand to repay a portion of our previous convertible notes in november  management decided to convert all of our marketable securities into cash 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  income from investments may decrease in the future
