item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
risk factors 
the following paragraphs describe material risks that could affect our business 
other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
risks relating to our business difficult market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected our industry and our business 
dramatic declines in the housing market  with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions 
in addition  the values of other real estate collateral supporting many loans have declined and may continue to decline 
general downward economic trends  reduced availability of commercial credit and increasing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit  resulting in additional write downs 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer loan deliquencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity 
competition among depository institutions for deposits has increased significantly 
financial institutions have experienced decreased access to capital and to deposits or borrowings 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets has adversely affected most businesses and the prices of securities in general  and financial institutions in particular  and it will continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our credit exposure is made more complex by these difficult market and economic conditions 
as a result of the foregoing factors  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations 
this increased government action may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
we also may be required to pay even higher federal deposit insurance corporation fdic premiums than the recently increased level  because financial institution failures resulting from the depressed market conditions have depleted and may continue to deplete the deposit insurance fund and reduce its ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
we do not believe these difficult conditions are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market and economic conditions on us  our customers and the other financial institutions in our market 
as a result  we may experience increases in foreclosures  delinquencies and customer bankruptcies  as well as more restricted access to funds 

table of contents recent legislative and regulatory initiatives to address difficult market and economic conditions may not stabilize the us banking system 
the recently enacted the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa authorizes treasury to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to billion in mortgage loans  mortgage related securities and certain other financial instruments  including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies  under a troubled asset relief program  or tarp 
the purpose of tarp is to restore confidence and stability to the us banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other 
the treasury has allocated billion towards the tarp capital purchase program 
under that program  treasury is purchasing equity securities from participating institutions 
in february  the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was enacted containing additional provisions designed to support the national economy and aid in economic recovery 
the provisions of eesa and arra are in addition to numerous other actions by the federal reserve  treasury  the fdic  the sec and others to address the current decline in the national economy and liquidity and credit crisis that commenced in these measures include homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  emergency action against short selling practices  a temporary guaranty program for money market funds  the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers  and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector 
the purpose of these legislative and regulatory actions is to stabilize the us banking system 
however  there is no assurance that eesa  arra and the other regulatory initiatives described above will be fully effective or have their desired effects 
if the volatility in the markets continues and economic conditions fail to improve or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented 
the capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption for more than a year 
more recently  the volatility and disruption has increased  and the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for many issuers without regard to their underlying financial strength 
this has been particularly the case with respect to financial institutions  and the market prices of the stock of financial services companies in general  including ours  are at their lowest levels in recent history 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on our ability to access capital and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio 
lending money is a substantial part of our business 
every loan carries a degree of risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment 
this risk is affected by  among other things cash flow of the borrower and or a business activity being financed  in the case of a collateralized loan  changes in and uncertainties regarding future values of collateral  the credit history of a particular borrower  changes in economic and industry conditions  and the duration of the loan 
we use underwriting procedures and criteria that we believe minimize the risk of loan delinquencies and losses  but banks routinely incur losses in their loan portfolios 
regardless of the underwriting criteria we use  we will experience loan losses from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  and some of those losses will result from factors beyond our control 
these factors include  among other things  changes in market  economic  business or personal conditions  or other events including changes in market interest rates  that affect our borrowers abilities to repay their loans and the value of properties that collateralize loans 
recent difficulties in the national economy and housing market  declining real estate values  rising unemployment  and loss of consumer confidence  have resulted and will continue to result in increasing loan delinquencies and loan losses for all financial institutions 

table of contents we maintain an allowance for loan losses which we believe is appropriate to provide for potential losses in our loan portfolio 
the amount of our allowance is determined by our management through a periodic review and consideration of internal and external factors that affect loan collectability  including  but not limited to an ongoing review of the quality  size and diversity of the loan portfolio  evaluation of non performing loans  historical default and loss experience  historical recovery experience  existing economic conditions  risk characteristics of various classifications of loans  and the amount and quality of collateral  including guarantees  securing the loans 
however  if delinquency levels increase or we incur higher than expected loan losses in the future  there is no assurance that our allowance will be adequate to cover resulting losses 
a large percentage of our loans are secured by real estate 
adverse conditions in the real estate market in our banking markets might adversely affect on our loan portfolio 
while we do not have a sub prime lending program  a relatively large percentage of our loans are secured by real estate 
our management believes that  in the case of many of those loans  the real estate collateral is not being relied upon as the primary source of repayment  and the level of our real estate loans reflects  at least in part  our policy to take real estate whenever possible as primary or additional collateral rather than other types of collateral 
however  adverse conditions in the real estate market and the economy in general have decreased real estate values in our banking markets 
if the value of our collateral for a loan falls below the outstanding balance of that loan  our ability to collect the balance of the loan by selling the underlying real estate in the event of a default will be diminished  and we would be more likely to suffer a loss on the loan 
an increase in our loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the fdic recently adopted rules aimed at placing additional monitoring and management controls on financial institutions whose loan portfolios are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate cre 
at december   our loan portfolio exceeded thresholds established by the fdic for cre concentrations and for additional regulatory scrutiny 
indications from regulators are that strict limitations on the amount or percentage of cre within any given portfolio are not expected  but  rather  that additional reporting and analysis will be required to document management s evaluation of the potential additional risks of such concentrations and the impact of any mitigating factors 
it is possible that regulatory constraints associated with these rules could adversely affect our ability to grow loan assets and thereby limit our overall growth and expansion plans 
these rules also could increase the costs of monitoring and managing this component of our loan portfolio 
either of these eventualities could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities  or on terms which are acceptable to us  could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally affect our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
among other sources of funds  we rely heavily on deposits for funds to make loans and provide for our other liquidity needs 
however  our loan demand has exceeded the rate at which we have been able to build core deposits  so we have 
table of contents relied heavily on time deposits  including out of market certificates of deposit  as a source of funds 
those deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and  in the future  depositors may not renew those time deposits when they mature  or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to attract or keep them or to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources 
not being able to attract those deposits  or to keep or replace them as they mature  would adversely affect our liquidity 
paying higher deposit rates to attract  keep or replace those deposits could have a negative effect on our interest margin and operating results 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future in order to continue to grow  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
federal and state banking regulators require us to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
in addition  in the future we may need to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital 
in that regard  a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital in response to a deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market  deteriorating economic conditions  declines in real estate values and other factors 
on december   our three capital ratios were above well capitalized levels under bank regulatory guidelines 
however  as described in note to our audited financial statements included in item of this report  our and the bank s boards of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective banking regulators which  among other things  require that the bank maintain capital levels in excess of the normal statutory minimums  including a leverage capital ratio of not less than  and other ratios at least at well capitalized levels 
at december   our leverage capital ratio was 
as a result  we will have to either reduce our assets so as to increase that ratio  or increase our capital 
we have applied to participate in the tarp capital purchase program  but there is no assurance that we will become a participant in that program 
future growth in our earning assets resulting from internal expansion and new branch offices  at rates in excess of the rate at which our capital is increased through retained earnings  will reduce our capital ratios unless we continue to increase our capital 
also  future unexpected losses  whether resulting from loan losses or other causes  would reduce our capital 
we have applied to participate in the tarp capital purchase program 
however  should we need  or be required by regulatory authorities  to raise additional capital in the future in order to redeem any preferred stock we sell to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program  or otherwise to support our operations and growth  we may seek to do so through the issuance of  among other things  our common stock or preferred stock 
however  our ability to raise that additional capital will depend on conditions at that time in the capital markets  economic conditions  our financial performance and condition  and other factors  many of which are outside our control 
there is no assurance that  if needed  we will be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to us  may have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our operations  and on our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
if we participate in the tarp capital purchase program and are unable to redeem the preferred stock we sell to the us treasury after five years  the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially 
the dividend rate on any preferred stock we sell under the tarp capital purchase program will increase from per annum to per annum after five years 
depending on our financial condition at the time  this increase in the annual dividend rate could have a material negative effect on our liquidity and on our net income available to holders of our common stock 
our profitability is subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our profitability depends  to a large extent  on our net interest income  which is the difference between our income on interest earning assets and our expense on interest bearing deposits and other liabilities 
in other words  to be profitable  we have to earn more interest on our loans and investments than we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
like most financial institutions  we are affected by changes in general interest rate levels and by other economic factors beyond our control 
interest rate risk arises in part from the mismatch ie  the interest sensitivity gap between the dollar amounts of repricing or maturing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and is measured in terms of the ratio of the interest rate sensitivity gap to total assets 
when more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities will reprice or mature over a given time period  a bank is considered asset sensitive and has a positive gap 
when more 
table of contents liabilities than assets will reprice or mature over a given time period  a bank is considered liability sensitive and has a negative gap 
a liability sensitive position ie  a negative gap may generally enhance net interest income in a falling interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
an asset sensitive position ie  a positive gap may generally enhance net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling interest rate environment 
our ability to manage our gap position determines to a great extent our ability to operate profitably 
however  fluctuations in interest rates are not predictable or controllable  and we cannot assure you we will be able to manage our gap position in a manner that will allow us to remain profitable 
on december   we had a negative one year cumulative interest sensitivity gap  which means that  during a one year period  our interest bearing liabilities generally would be expected to reprice at a faster rate than our interest earning assets 
our business depends on the condition of the local and regional economies where we operate 
we currently have offices only in one region of north carolina 
consistent with our community banking philosophy  a majority of our customers are located in and do business in that region  and we lend a substantial portion of our capital and deposits to commercial and consumer borrowers in our local banking markets 
therefore  our local and regional economy has a direct impact on our ability to generate deposits to support loan growth  the demand for loans  the ability of borrowers to repay loans  the value of collateral securing our loans particularly loans secured by real estate  and our ability to collect  liquidate and restructure problem loans 
if our local communities are adversely affected by current conditions in the national economy or by other specific events or trends  there could be a direct adverse effect on our operating results 
adverse economic conditions in our banking markets could reduce our growth rate  affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us  and generally affect our financial condition and operating results 
we are less able than larger institutions to spread risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies 
new or changes in existing tax  accounting  and regulatory rules and interpretations could have an adverse effect on our strategic initiatives  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit a financial company s shareholders 
these regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations  and our compliance with regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities  including payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions  investments  loans and interest rates charged  interest rates paid on deposits  and locations of offices 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described under item business supervision and regulation 
these regulations  along with the currently existing tax  accounting  securities  insurance  and monetary laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations  control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
the laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
as a result of recent turmoil in the financial services industry  it is likely that there will be an increase in the regulation of all financial institutions 
we cannot predict the effects of future changes on our business and profitability 
significant legal actions could subject us to substantial liabilities 
we are from time to time subject to claims related to our operations 
these claims and legal actions  including supervisory actions by our regulators  could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs 
as a result  we may be exposed to substantial liabilities  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
among the laws that apply to us  the usa patriot and bank secrecy acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities 
if such activities are detected  financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the treasury s office of financial crimes enforcement network 
these rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions 
several banking institutions have recently received large fines for non compliance with these laws and regulations 
although we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations  no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations 

table of contents competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability 
our future growth and success will depend on  among other things  our ability to compete effectively with other financial services providers in our banking markets 
to date  we have grown our business by focusing on our lines of business and emphasizing the high level of service and responsiveness desired by our customers 
however  commercial banking in our banking markets and in north carolina as a whole is extremely competitive 
we compete against commercial banks  credit unions  savings and loan associations  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market funds and other mutual funds  as well as other local and community  super regional  national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our market areas and elsewhere 
we compete with these institutions in attracting deposits and in making loans  and we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents 
our larger competitors have greater resources  broader geographic markets and name recognition  and higher lending limits than we do  and they can offer more products and services and better afford and more effectively use media advertising  support services and electronic technology than we can 
also  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do 
while we believe we compete effectively with other financial institutions  we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our size  lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread marketing costs across a broader market 
although we compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary markets with local advertisements  personal contacts and greater flexibility and responsiveness in working with local customers  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be an effective competitor in our banking markets 
we rely on dividends from the bank for substantially all of our revenue 
we receive substantially all of our revenue as dividends from the bank 
as described under the caption item business supervision and regulation  federal and state regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to us  and our and the bank s boards of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective banking regulators which require that we and the bank obtain the consent of our regulators before we may pay any cash dividends 
if the bank becomes unable to pay dividends to us  then we may not be able to service our debt  pay our other obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and on any preferred stock we sell to the us treasury if we participate in the tarp capital purchase program 
accordingly  our inability to receive dividends from the bank could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and the value of your investment in our common stock 
we depend on the services of our current management team 
our operating results and ability to adequately manage our growth and minimize loan losses are highly dependent on the services  managerial abilities and performance of our executive officers 
smaller banks  like us  sometimes find it more difficult to attract and retain experienced management personnel than larger banks 
we currently have an experienced management team that our board of directors believes is capable of managing and growing the bank 
however  changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks relating to our common stock the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive 
we cannot predict how or at what prices our common stock will trade in the future 
the market value of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following  most of which are beyond our control  as well as the other factors described in this risk factors section actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by financial analysts  actions of our current shareholders  including sales of common stock by existing shareholders and our directors and executive officers  
table of contents fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  regulatory developments  and developments related to the financial services industry 
the market value of and trading in our common stock also is affected by conditions including price and trading fluctuations affecting the financial markets in general  and in the market for the stocks of financial services companies in particular 
these conditions may result in volatility in the market prices of stocks generally and  in turn  our common stock 
also  market conditions may result in sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market 
in each case  market conditions could affect the market price of our stock in a way that is unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance 
the trading volume in our common stock has been low  and the sale of a substantial number of shares in the public market could depress the price of our stock and make it difficult for you to sell your shares 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market  but it has a relatively low average daily trading volume relative to many other stocks 
thinly traded stock can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market  which can lead to significant price swings even when a relatively small number of shares are being traded and limit an investor s ability to quickly sell blocks of stock 
we cannot predict what effect future sales of our common stock in the market  or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale in the market  will have on the market price of our common stock 
our management beneficially owns a substantial percentage of our common stock  so our directors and executive officers can significantly affect voting results on matters voted on by our shareholders 
our current directors and executive officers  as a group  beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock 
because of their voting rights  in matters put to a vote of our shareholders it could be difficult for any group of our other shareholders to defeat a proposal favored by our management including the election of one or more of our directors or to approve a proposal opposed by management 
if we participate in the tarp capital purchase program  there will be restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock 
the securities purchase agreement we would enter into with the us treasury generally would provide that  for a period of three years  we could not  without the consent of treasury increase the cash dividend on our common stock  or subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock other than the preferred stock we sell to treasury or trust preferred securities 
in addition  we would be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock unless we were current in our dividend payments on the preferred stock we sold to the us treasury 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant described in the next risk factor  could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
moreover  holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future 
if we participate in the tarp capital purchase program  the preferred stock we sell to the us treasury will affect net income available to our common shareholders and our earnings per common share  and the warrant we would issue to treasury may be dilutive to holders of our common stock 
the dividends we paid on the preferred stock sold to the us treasury would reduce the net income available to our common shareholders and our earnings per common share 
the preferred stock also would receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up of our company 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock would be diluted to the extent the warrant we would be required to issue to treasury in conjunction with the sale of preferred stock is exercised 
although treasury would agree not to vote any of the shares of our common stock it received upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant would not be bound by that restriction

under north carolina law  subject to certain restrictions  we are authorized to pay dividends as declared by our board of directors 
however  although we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank  our principal source of funds with which we can pay dividends to our shareholders and pay our own obligations is dividends we received from the bank 
for that reason  our ability to pay dividends effectively is subject to the same limitations that apply to the bank 
information regarding restrictions on our and the bank s ability to pay dividends is contained in item of this report under the caption payment of dividends 
in the future  any declaration and payment of cash dividends will be subject to the board of directors evaluation of our operating results  financial condition  future growth plans  general business and economic conditions  and tax and other relevant considerations 
also  the payment of cash dividends in the future will be subject to ongoing review by our banking regulators and to certain other legal and regulatory limitations including the requirement that our capital be maintained at certain minimum levels 
in that regard  our and the bank s boards of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective bank regulators described in note to our audited financial statements included in item of this report which require that we and the bank obtain the consent of our regulators before we may pay any cash dividends

the following presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion is intended to assist in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations  and it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors

bank of the carolinas corporation the company is a north carolina chartered bank holding company that was incorporated on may   for the sole purpose of serving as the parent bank holding company for the bank 
the bank is an insured  north carolina chartered bank that began operations on december   under the name bank of davie 
because the company has no operations and conducts no business on its own other than owning bank of carolinas the bank  the discussion contained in these footnotes concerns primarily the business of the bank 
however  for ease of reading and because the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  the company and its subsidiary are collectively referred to herein as the company unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the notes to our audited financial statements for the years ended december   and contain a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our policies with respect to methodology for the determination of our allowance for loan losses  and our asset impairment judgments  such as the recoverability of the intangible assets  involve a higher degree of complexity and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
accordingly  we consider the policies related to those areas critical 
our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimatable  and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  the present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market  and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to income 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which those loans  in our opinion  become uncollectible 
recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance 
the factors that influence our judgment in determining the amount charged to non interest expense include past loan experience  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s determination of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
this model has several components 
the first component involves the estimation of losses on loans management has individually evaluated and defined as impaired loans 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the estimated valuation allowance is the difference  if any  between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective rate  or in the case of a collateral dependent loan  the fair value of the collateral 
second  for all other loans  including individually evaluated loans determined not to be impaired  the bank establishes an allowance for groups or pools of loans with similar risk characteristics by applying the average actual historical loss rates for these pools 
finally  there is a component to adjust for several qualitative or environmental factors that could cause estimated credit losses within the bank s existing portfolio to differ from the historical loss experience 

table of contents we review our allowance on a quarterly basis and believe that the allowance is appropriate to cover inherent loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
however  the determination of the allowance using our procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that we will not  in any particular period  sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amounts reserved for those loans  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio and our allowance  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their routine examination process  periodically review our allowance 
those agencies may require that we make additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
accounting for intangible assets is as prescribed by sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for recognized intangible assets based on their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized  while intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to fair value impairment tests on at least an annual basis 
if based upon our evaluation impairment has occurred  the impairment charge is recognized at that time 
during the evaluation of our goodwill  the determination was made that our goodwill was impaired and the entire remaining balance of  was charged off our balance sheet 
overview during the year  our assets increased by million to million at december  from million at year end our net loss for was million as compared to net income of million for the amount included a one time after tax charge of  related to the terminated merger agreement with randolph bank trust company 
the bank experienced growth of over million in its loan portfolio during however  even with this growth  the bank along with most other community banks  has struggled to maintain its net interest margins in the current interest rate environment and will most likely continue to face those same challenges in we strive to serve the financial needs of small to medium sized businesses  individuals  and residential homebuilders  offering a broad array of banking and other financial products emphasizing superior customer service 
real estate secured loans  including construction loans and loans secured by existing commercial and residential properties  comprise the majority of our loan portfolio  with the balance of our loans consisting of commercial and industrial loans and loans to individuals 
we also offer certain loan products through associations with various mortgage lending companies 
through these associations  we originate family residential mortgages  at both fixed and variable rates 
we earn fees for originating these loans and transferring the loan package to the mortgage lending companies 
it has been our strategy to recruit skilled banking professionals who are well trained and highly knowledgeable about our market area  enabling us to develop and maintain a loan portfolio of sound credit quality 
the deposit services we offer include small business and personal checking accounts  savings accounts  money market checking accounts and certificates of deposit 
the company concentrates on providing customer service to build its customer deposit base and competes aggressively in the area of transaction accounts 
additional funding includes borrowings from the federal home loan bank and from federal funds purchased lines of credit 
our results of operations are heavily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also materially affected by our provision for loan losses  fee income generated from deposit and loan accounts  and noninterest expenses 
our noninterest expense primarily consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expense  professional services  advertising  and other noninterest expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  changes in interest rates  and actions of regulatory and governmental authorities

interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity and amount of the loan 
competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulation also influence interest rates 
on average  our loan portfolio yielded for the year ending december  as compared to an average yield of during we intend to continue the growth of high quality loan assets to the extent permitted by our capital 
with continued expansion of our geographic market area and the strong acceptance of our products and services within the communities we serve  we expect loan growth to continue

we are required to maintain an allowance for loan losses that reflects the size and risk in our loan portfolio 
this has made it necessary for us to make significant provisions for loan losses 
in the past this principally has reflected the growth in our portfolio 
however  in the current economic environment we have taken significant provisions and write downs related to problem credits 
we anticipate our provision for loan losses will continue to be a major portion of our non interest expense particularly until current economic conditions improve 
during  we recorded gross charge offs in the amount of  which impacted our provision for loan losses during the period 
growth of our loan portfolio as well as an overall increase in non performing assets were the most significant factors contributing to the increase in our allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses has increased substantially from december   primarily due to specific charge offs related to several commercial credits 
a significant portion of the impaired loan balance is tied to two large credits of which the remaining balance is backed by a usda guarantee 
the company has additional loans in a nonaccrual status that are backed by a variety of forms of collateral  these include but are not limited to residential properties  undeveloped land and commercial equipment 
the company has not made nor does it hold any subprime residential real estate loans 
however  we have been affected by the economic downturn in several of our markets 
the significant write offs during the year are a reflection of this downturn and our intention to write troubled credits down to their current realizable value 
we continue to work with our customers with troubled credit relationships to the extent that it is reasonably possible 
the company has historically been aggressive in identifying and recording losses as we believe they are necessary and these charges reflect that continued philosophy 
our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of loans has increased from last year primarily as a result of increased reserves for impaired loans

asset quality 
certain credit risks are inherent in making loans  particularly commercial and consumer loans 
we assess these risks and attempt to manage them effectively 
we also attempt to reduce credit risk by adhering to internal credit underwriting policies and procedures 
these policies and procedures include officer and customer limits  periodic loan documentation review and follow up on exceptions to credit policies 
a loan is placed in a non accrual status when  in our judgment  the collection of interest appears doubtful 
nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans contractually past due for more than days but still accruing interest  and foreclosed or idled properties 
the company s non performing assets were million at december   or of net loans 
on december   we had no loans that were delinquent over days and still accruing interest  and million that were in non accrual status 
interest accrued  but not recognized as income on non accrual loans  was approximately  during a significant portion of our loans classified as non accrual were made to one customer 
the outstanding loans to this customer included in the non accrual total were million 
of that amount  is backed by a usda guarantee  thereby substantially decreasing our potential write off 
we are in the process of liquidating the equipment associated with this loan and are attempting to sell the real estate associated with the loan 
we have another million loan that was in nonaccrual status at december  where our exposure has since been reduced by  due to pay downs by the customer from a partial liquidation of collateral 
other real estate owned at december   totaled million and consisted of twenty eight properties 
other real estate owned is carried on the balance sheet at values that we feel are less than or equal to the net amounts we will receive for the properties when they are sold 
this total includes a million loan related to an a d property in chimney rock  nc 
the company believes it can sell the property at the current book value but it may take some time to find a qualified interested buyer 
the company also has several rental properties that it has taken into other real estate  nearly all of the properties are occupied and were not originally sub prime loans 
the book balance of these properties total million

held to maturity securities are carried at book value and available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
we use our investment portfolio as a tool to provide liquidity  manage interest rate risk and provide supplemental earnings 
with our rapid growth since we began operations  and with the continuing growth we expect will occur  we recognize the need to manage liquidity through our investment portfolio 
our securities may be sold from time to time to increase liquidity or re balance the interest rate sensitivity profile of our balance sheet 
however  we do have the available liquidity to hold our securities to maturity should we have the need to 
in fact  we have classified some of our more illiquid securities as held to maturity because we fully intend to hold them until their maturity date

this change was primarily the function of tremendous growth of million in our money market accounts during as well as a significant reduction in our brokered deposits 
the significant growth in money market accounts began in july when we offered a special money market rate that is good through june  we have used this opportunity to re structure our balance sheet by creating more transaction accounts while significantly reducing our exposure to brokered deposits 
we have also used this opportunity to expand the number of services each household has with our institution

the trust preferred securities were issued at libor plus basis points and re price quarterly 
our leverage ratio fell slightly below the current required ratio required by our informal agreement with our regulators to as of december  as a result  we will have to either reduce our assets so as to increase that ratio  or increase our capital 
we have applied to participate in the tarp capital purchase program  but there is no assurance that we will become a participant in that program 
off balance sheet transactions

net income for fell million or per share 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in compared to tax expense of  in the majority of the fluctuation in these amounts is the net economic loss which can be recorded on our tax returns and carried back to previous years 
return on average assets was  and and return on average equity was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net interest income 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between income generated by our interest earning assets primarily loans  investment securities  and interest bearing balances and the expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowed funds used to fund earning assets 
net interest income decreased million to million from to and was virtually unchanged from to at million and million respectively 
our net interest margin and net interest spread decreased to and in from and in and and in these decreases have primarily been a function of a significant increase in our non accrual loans from  at december  to million at december  the other significant contributing factor to the difference is the basis point drop by the federal reserve in the discount rate between september and the present 
during  average interest earning assets grew million during the year while average interest bearing liabilities grew by million 
this nearly identical growth in assets and liabilities coupled with a decrease of basis points on the assets yield versus an basis points decrease for the liabilities led to the decrease in the margins 
our net interest income is affected by both the difference between the rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

provision for loan losses increased million to million during from million for the increased provision was due to increased loan volume during the year as well as a significant increase in non performing assets and charge offs during the year 
the company s non performing assets increased million over the amount 
however  outstanding credits to one customer total million which is backed by a usda guarantee on any loss the company should incur 
we also have an outstanding loan of million in nonaccrual status as of december  which the principal balance has subsequently been reduced by  by a partial liquidation of collateral by the borrower 
as previously stated  we are in the process of liquidating the equipment from this business and are actively pursuing a buyer for the real estate 
we have seen a significant downturn in the economy in most of the markets we serve 
this has precipitated significant charge offs during the year 
we continue to work with our customers to the extent possible to bring their credit current while aggressively identifying and charging off credits as necessary 
net loan charge offs were million during the period compared to  in and  in the company has million of specific reserves on million of impaired loans 
the allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of total loans was   and at december   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of net loans decreased to at december  from at december  and at december  provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level we deem appropriate 
in evaluating the allowance for loan losses  we consider factors that include growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors 
non interest income 
in addition to net interest income  we derive revenues from a variety of financial products and services offered to our customers 
the majority of our non interest income results from service charges on our deposit accounts  including charges for insufficient funds  check sales  and fees charged for non deposit services and from mortgage loan broker fees

as has been previously discussed  the company took a  charge during the year related to the impairment of its goodwill

table of contents capital adequacy we are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic has issued risk based capital and leverage capital guidelines for measuring the adequacy of a bank s capital  and all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for us to be considered in compliance with the fdic s requirements 
on december   our total capital ratio and tier capital ratio were and  respectively  which were well above the minimum levels required by the fdic s guidelines 
on december  our leverage capital ratio was  which was also well above the minimum level required by the fdic s guidelines 
however  our and the bank s board of directors have entered into informal agreements with our respective banking regulators which are described in note to our audited financial statements included in item of this report 
among other things  the agreements require that the bank maintain capital levels in excess of normal statutory minimums  including a leverage capital ratio of not less than  and other ratios at least at well capitalized levels 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity 
liquidity management is the process of managing assets and liabilities as well as their maturities to insure adequate funding for loan and deposit activity as well as continued growth of the company 
sources of funding come from both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet 
asset side sources include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold and unpledged available for sale securities 
these totaled million at december  and million at december  liquidity sources from liabilities include deposits and lines of credit with other institutions 
these sources are largely affected by our ability to attract and maintain deposits 
our deposits  together with equity capital  funded percent of total assets at december  the company has million in borrowing lines available from various correspondent banks and million at the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb for short term or long term funding 
at december   the company had total borrowings of million from the fhlb  with maturity dates on these borrowings extending through a blanket lien on loans secured by residential family dwellings  qualifying non residential loans and home equity lines of credit is in place with the fhlb to secure these advances 
the company closely monitors and evaluates its overall liquidity position 
the company believes its liquidity position at december  is adequate to meet its operating needs 
interest rate sensitivity 
our goal is to maintain a neutral position on interest rate sensitivity whereby little or no change in interest income would occur as interest rates change 
on december   we were cumulatively liability sensitive for the next twelve months  which means that our interest bearing liabilities would reprice more quickly than our interest bearing assets 
theoretically  our net interest margin will decrease if market interest rates rise or increase if market interest rates fall 
however  the repricing characteristic of assets is different from the repricing characteristics of funding sources 
therefore  net interest income can be impacted by changes in interest rates even if the repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities are perfectly matched 

table of contents the following table shows the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet on december   but is not necessarily indicative of our position on other dates 
each category of assets and liabilities is shown with projected repricing and maturity dates 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets or liabilities 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
now accounts  savings accounts  and money market accounts are assumed to be subject to immediate repricing and depositor availability 
prepayment assumptions on mortgage loans and decay rates on deposit accounts have not been included in this analysis 
also  the table does not reflect scheduled principal repayments that will be received on loans 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities may vary substantially if different assumptions are used or if our actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions

as a result  a bank s performance may be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates 
although the banking industry is more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation in the price of goods and services  inflation also is a factor that may influence interest rates 
yet  the frequency and magnitude of interest rate fluctuations do not necessarily coincide with changes in the general inflation rate 
inflation does affect our operating expense in that personnel expense and the cost of supplies and outside services tend to increase more during periods of high inflation
