overview of our business we provide government sponsored social services directly and through not for profit social services organizations whose operations we manage  and we arrange for and manage non emergency transportation 
table of contents services 
as a result of and in response to the large and growing population of eligible beneficiaries of government sponsored social services and non emergency transportation services  increasing pressure on governments to control costs and increasing acceptance of privatized social services  we have grown both organically and by consummating strategic acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy we have expanded our in home counseling and foster care service offerings in georgia  illinois and indiana as a result of two strategic acquisitions in described below 
despite our business growth  during the latter half of we experienced a significant and sustained decline in the market value of our common stock 
the decline was due to lower than anticipated earnings for that resulted primarily from uncertainty in the state payer environment and the impact of related budgetary decisions and from the sharp down turn in the united states economy which led to reductions in state budgets  withheld funds  volume decreases  payment slowdowns and higher utilization of our non emergency transportation services 
as discussed in more detail below we contract with various payers to provide non emergency transportation management services under capitated contracts where we are paid on a fixed fee per member per month basis 
in the periods of high utilization that occurred during portions of  we experienced lower operating margins in our non emergency transportation management services business as the cost of providing non emergency transportation management services increased with a lag in our ability to impact the rates we are paid to provide these services 
the foregoing circumstances triggered our need to perform impairment tests with respect to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of these tests  we wrote down a significant portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets primarily related to the non emergency transportation services operating segment as more fully described below under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  we have significant contractual obligations  including financial covenant requirements  related to our long term debt for the fiscal year and beyond 
to address our liquidity concerns related to our ability to meet our financial covenant requirements  we entered into an amendment to our credit and guaranty agreement with cit capital securities llc  or cit  on march  to  among other things  change those requirements as more fully described below under the heading entitled liquidity and capital resources 
as a result of this amendment  we believe that we will meet all of our financial covenant requirements for and that we have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations through at least december  in november  we announced that we were focusing on several strategic options to enhance stockholder value relating to  among other things  growing our core social services business  reducing corporate and client service costs  selling certain of our non strategic assets and reducing or delevering our debt 
since such time  we have accomplished the following growing our core social services business 
we have dramatically increased our client census 
december was the highest of any month in an increase over september of approximately  clients and an increase over december of  clients 
we have also won several new contract awards 
in february  we were awarded a us million three year contract in canada to operate a work force development program for returning veterans and two new annual contracts in california aggregating million to operate adult mental health wellness centers 
reducing corporate and client costs 
we have taken several steps to increase our profitability by decreasing our operating expenses 
we implemented an across the board wage freeze and made reductions in vacation  sick and holiday pay effective as of january   we have implemented health care benefit reductions effective as of july   we have reduced our workforce in pennsylvania  north carolina and canada  and  in selected markets  we have decreased the use of fixed salaried personnel in favor of hourly employees 
to further reduce costs  we also suspended the executive salary parity recommendations for that had been provided to the compensation committee of our board of directors  or committee  by mercer us inc  an independent outside compensation consultant engaged by the committee to 
table of contents provide information and advice related to the compensation of our chief executive officer and other four highest paid executive officers  collectively referred to as our senior executives  for and the mercer recommendations for and were developed based on the committee s intention of raising the total compensation for each of our senior executives from the th percentile level to the th percentile level by and were based on an executive compensation comparison among similar companies 
the amounts fixed by the committee for our senior executives total compensation which includes salary  potential incentive bonuses under an annual incentive compensation program at their target levels  described below  and annual non discretionary equity awards  but not potential additional incentive bonus amounts that would be payable under this annual incentive compensation program in the event targeted earnings per share measures are exceeded or any discretionary bonuses or awards that may be granted by the board from time to time for was aligned with the th percentile level for total compensation set forth in the mercer recommendations 
the mercer recommendations with respect to total compensation that were suspended by the committee with respect to our senior executives for were targeted at the th percentile level  an aggregate difference of approximately million over s th percentile level for such compensation 
as part of the total compensation of certain of our senior executives  the committee established an annual incentive compensation program for and  or annual plan  which provides  among other things  that an incentive cash bonus with a minimum target of of the annual base salary for our chief executive officer and of the annual base salary for three of our other senior executives  if earned  may be paid annually to these officers 
of that potential cash incentive bonus  is based on individual performance and is based on our achievement of earnings per share  or eps  measures established by the committee 
in addition to suspending for the increase from the th percentile level to the th percentile level in the total compensation for our senior executives  referred to above  the committee has also eliminated in its entirety the eps related portion of the potential incentive bonus under the annual plan for  thus reducing the aggregate total compensation for our senior executives for below s th percentile level by an additional million 
selling non strategic assets 
in november  we retained ubs investment bank  or ubs  to serve as our financial advisor in connection with the potential sale of our non emergency transportation services operations  which are conducted through our subsidiary  charter lci corporation  and its associated operating subsidiaries  collectively referred to as logisticare 
since then  we have received indications of value with respect to the potential sale of logisticare from various prospects 
there is no assurance  however  that we will ultimately accept any of the offers we have received or successfully complete the sale of logisticare or any other of our non strategic assets 
reducing or delevering our debt 
if and when we complete the sale of our non strategic assets although there is no assurance that we will  we will use the proceeds therefrom to pay down a substantial portion of our senior debt 
to address our liquidity concerns with respect to this debt  however  we entered into the march amendment to our credit agreement with cit  discussed above  changing certain of our financial covenant requirements with respect to such debt to a level where we met our covenant requirements for the fourth quarter of and believe we will continue to meet our covenant requirements through at least december  focusing on our core competencies in the delivery of home and community based counseling  foster care and not for profit managed services  we believe we are well positioned to offer the highest quality of service to our clients and provide a viable alternative to state and local governments current service delivery systems 
our goal is to be the primary provider of choice to the social services industry 
as of december   we provided social services directly and through the entities we manage to over  clients  and had million individuals eligible to receive services under our non emergency transportation services contracts 
we provided services to these clients from locations in states  the district of columbia and british columbia 

table of contents our working capital requirements are primarily funded by cash from operations and borrowings from our credit facility with cit  which provides funding for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
how we grow our business and evaluate our performance our business grows internally through organic expansion into new markets  increases in the number of clients served under contracts we or our managed entities are awarded  and externally through acquisitions 
we typically pursue organic expansion into markets that are contiguous to our existing markets or where we believe we can quickly establish a significant presence 
when we expand organically into a market  we typically have no clients or perform no management services in the market and are required to incur start up costs including the costs of space  required permits and initial personnel 
these costs are expensed as incurred and our new offices can be expected to incur losses for a period of time until we adequately grow our revenue from clients or management fees 
we also pursue strategic acquisitions in markets where we see opportunities but where we lack the contacts and or personnel to make a successful organic entry 
unlike organic expansion which involves start up costs that may dilute earnings  expansion through acquisitions have generally been accretive to our earnings 
however  we bear financing risk and where debt is used  the risk of leverage by expanding through acquisitions 
we also must integrate the acquired business into our operations which could disrupt our business and we may not be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration 
finally  our acquisitions involve purchase prices in excess of the fair value of tangible assets and cash or receivables 
this excess purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and is subject to periodic evaluation and impairment or other write downs that are charges against our earnings 
in all our markets we focus on several key performance indicators in managing our business 
specifically  we focus on growth in the number of clients served  as that particular metric is the key driver of our revenue growth 
we also focus on the number of employees and the amount of outsourced transportation cost as these items are our most important variable costs and the key to the management of our operating margins 
acquisitions since december   we completed the following acquisitions on september   we acquired substantially all of the assets in illinois and indiana of camelot community care  inc  or ccc 
ccc is a florida not for profit tax exempt corporation with operations in florida  illinois  indiana  ohio and texas that provides home and community based services and foster care services 
the purchase price of approximately million consisted of cash in the amount of approximately  with the remaining million credited against the purchase price for all of ccc s indebtedness to us for management services rendered by us to ccc under several management services agreements 
historically  we provided various management services to ccc for a fee under separate management services agreements for each state in which ccc operated 
in connection with our acquisition of the assets of ccc s illinois and indiana operations  we consolidated our remaining management services agreements with ccc ie  florida  ohio and texas into one administrative service agreement under which we will provide a more narrow range of services to ccc as compared to the services historically provided by us 
we believe this acquisition expands our home and community based services and foster care services into illinois and further expands our presence in indiana 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded by our cash generated from operations 
effective september   we acquired all of the equity interest in americanwork  inc  or aw  a community based mental health provider operating in georgia locations 
aw provides  among other things  independent living services and training in support of individuals with mental illness  outpatient individual and 
table of contents group behavioral health services  and community based vocational and peer supported vocational and employment services 
the total purchase price consisted of cash in the amount of approximately million  with approximately million paid by us at closing on october  and the balance held by us for one year to secure potential indemnity obligations 
we believe this acquisition enhances our community based social services offering  expands our presence in georgia  and further positions us for growth 
the purchase price was funded by cash generated from our operations 
we continue to selectively identify and pursue attractive acquisition opportunities 
there are no assurances  however  that we will complete acquisitions in the future or that any completed acquisitions will prove profitable for us 
how we earn our revenue we operate in two segments social services and non emergency transportation services  or net services 
social services our revenue is derived from our provider contracts with state and local government agencies and government intermediaries  hmo s  commercial insurers  and from our management contracts with not for profit social services organizations 
the government entities that pay for our services include welfare  child welfare and justice departments  public schools and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of the contracts where we provide social services directly  we are paid an hourly fee 
in other such situations  we receive a set monthly amount or we are paid amounts equal to the costs we incur to provide agreed upon services 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of income as either revenue from home and community based services or foster care services 
where we contract to manage the operations of not for profit social services organizations  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenue of the managed entity or a predetermined fee 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as management fees 
because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and our management fees are largely dependent upon their revenues  we also monitor for management and disclosure purposes the revenues of our managed entities 
we refer to the revenues of these entities as managed entity revenue 
net services where we provide management services for non emergency transportation  we contract with either state government and regional medicaid agencies  local governments  or private managed care companies 
most of our contracts for non emergency transportation management services are capitated where we are paid on a per member per month basis for each eligible member 
we do not direct bill for services under our capitated contracts as our revenue is based on covered lives 
our special needs school transportation contracts are with local governments and are paid on a per trip basis or per bus per day basis 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as non emergency transportation services revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates general in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies are those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued transportation costs  accounting for management agreement relationships  loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs  stock based compensation  foreign currency translation  derivative instruments and hedging activities and income taxes 
we have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with our board of directors  audit committee and disclosure committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time services are rendered at predetermined amounts stated in our contracts and when the collection of these amounts is considered to be reasonably assured 
at times we may receive funding for certain services in advance of services actually being rendered 
these amounts are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until the actual services are rendered 
as services are rendered  documentation is prepared describing each service  time spent  and billing code under each contract to determine and support the value of each service provided 
this documentation is used as a basis for billing under our contracts 
the billing process and documentation submitted under our contracts vary among our payers 
the timing  amount and collection of our revenues under these contracts are dependent upon our ability to comply with the various billing requirements specified by each payer 
failure to comply with these requirements could delay the collection of amounts due to us under a contract or result in adjustments to amounts billed 
the performance of our contracts is subject to the condition that sufficient funds are appropriated  authorized and allocated by each state  city or other local government 
if sufficient appropriations  authorizations and allocations are not provided by the respective state  city or other local government  we are at risk of immediate termination or renegotiation of the financial terms of our contracts 
social services segment fee for service contracts 
revenues related to services provided under fee for service contracts are recognized as revenue at the time services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
such services are provided at established billing rates 
fee for service contracts represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost based service contracts 
revenues from our cost based service contracts are recorded based on a combination of direct costs  indirect overhead allocations  and stated contractual margins on those costs 
these revenues are compared to annual contract budget limits and  depending on reporting requirements  allowances may be recorded for certain contingencies such as projected costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or insufficient encounters 
this policy results in recognizing revenue from these contracts based on allowable costs incurred 
the annual contract amount is based on projected costs to provide services under the contracts with adjustments for changes in the total contract amount 
we annually submit projected costs for the coming year which assist the contracting payers in establishing the annual contract amount to be paid for services provided under the contracts 
after the contracting payers year end  we submit cost reports which are used by the contracting payers to determine the amount  if any  by which funds paid to us for services provided under the contracts were greater than the allowable costs to provide these services 
completion of this review process may take several years from the date we submit the cost report 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under contract  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 

table of contents our cost reports are routinely audited by our payers on an annual basis 
we periodically review our provisional billing rates and allocation of costs and provide for estimated adjustments from the contracting payers 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made in our consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any cost report audits 
differences between the amounts provided and the settlement amounts  which historically have not been material  are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in the year of settlement 
cost based service contracts represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
annual block purchase contract 
our annual block purchase contract with the community partnership of southern arizona  referred to as cpsa  requires us to provide or arrange for behavioral health services to eligible populations of beneficiaries as defined in the contract 
we must provide a complete range of behavioral health clinical  case management  therapeutic and administrative services 
we are obliged to provide services only to those clients with a demonstrated medical necessity 
our annual funding allocation amount is subject to increase when our encounters exceed the contract amount  however  such increases in the annual funding allocation amount are subject to government appropriation and may not be approved 
there is no contractual limit to the number of eligible beneficiaries that may be assigned to us  or a specified limit to the level of services that may be provided to these beneficiaries if the services are deemed to be medically necessary 
therefore  we are at risk if the costs of providing necessary services exceed the associated reimbursement 
we are required to regularly submit service encounters to cpsa electronically 
on an on going basis and at the end of cpsa s june fiscal year  cpsa is obligated to monitor the level of service encounters 
if the encounter data is not sufficient to support the year to date payments made to us  unless waived  cpsa has the right to prospectively reduce or suspend payments to us 
for revenue recognition purposes  our service encounter value which represents the value of actual services rendered must equal or exceed of the revenue recognized under our annual block purchase contract 
the remaining of revenue recognized in each reporting period represents payment for network overhead administrative costs incurred in order to fulfill our obligations under the contract 
administrative costs include  but are not limited to  intake services  clinical liaison oversight for each behavioral health recipient  cultural liaisons  financial assessments and screening  data processing and information systems  staff training  quality and utilization management functions  coordination of care and subcontract administration 
we recognize revenue from our annual block purchase contract corresponding to the service encounter value 
if our service encounter value is less than of the amounts received from cpsa  unless waived  we recognize revenue equal to the service encounter value and defer revenue for any excess amounts received 
cpsa has not reduced  withheld  or suspended any payments and we believe our encounter data is sufficient to have earned all amounts recorded as revenue under this contract 
if our service encounter value equals of the amounts received from cpsa  we recognize revenue at the contract amount  which is one twelfth of the established annual contract amount each month 
if our service encounter value exceeds of the contract amount  we recognize revenue in excess of the annual funding allocation amount if collection is reasonably assured 
we evaluate factors regarding payment probability related to the determination of whether any such additional revenue over the contractual amount is considered to be reasonably assured 
for  we did not recognize revenue in excess of the contract amount 
the terms of the contract may be reviewed prospectively and amended as necessary to ensure adequate funding of our contractual obligations 
our revenues under the annual block purchase contract for the years ended december  and represented of our social services operating segment revenues 
management agreements 
we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations whereby we provide certain management services for these organizations 
in exchange for 
table of contents our services  we receive a management fee that is either based on a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
management fees earned under our management agreements represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recognize management fees revenue from our management agreements as such amounts are earned  as defined by the respective management agreements  and collection of such amount is considered reasonably assured 
we assess the likelihood of whether any of our management fees may need to be returned to help our managed entities fund their working capital needs 
if the likelihood is other than remote  we defer the recognition of all or a portion of the management fees received 
to the extent we defer management fees as a means of funding any of our managed entities losses from operations  such amounts are not recognized as management fees revenue until they are ultimately collected from the operating income of the managed entities 
in addition  as part of our reinsurance programs  we reinsure a substantial portion of the general and professional liability and workers compensation cost of certain designated entities we manage through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  social services providers captive insurance company  or spcic 
further  we offered health insurance coverage to employees of certain entities we manage under our self funded health insurance program through june in exchange for this liability coverage we received a reimbursement equal to the pro rata share of the participating managed entities costs related to our reinsurance and self funded health insurance programs 
we recorded amounts received from these managed entities as management fees revenue 
revenues related to these arrangements for the years ended december  and represented less than of our social services revenue 
the costs associated with generating our management fee revenue are accounted for in client service expense and in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income 
net services segment capitation contracts 
approximately of our non emergency transportation services revenue is generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the transportation needs of a specific geographic population 
revenues under capitation contracts with our payers result from per member monthly fees based on the number of participants in our payer s program 
aggregate revenue from our top five payers from december  to december  and represented approximately and  respectively  of our net services operating segment revenue for such period 
fee for service contracts 
revenues earned under fee for service contracts are recognized when the service is provided 
revenue under these types of contracts is based upon contractually established billing rates less allowance for contractual adjustments 
estimates of contractual adjustments are based upon payment terms specified in the related agreements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts clients are referred to us through governmental social services programs and we only provide services at the direction of a payer under a contractual arrangement 
these circumstances have historically minimized any uncollectible amounts for services rendered 
however  we recognize that not all amounts recorded as accounts receivable will ultimately be collected 
we record all accounts receivable amounts at their contracted amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk that an account will not be collected 
we regularly evaluate our accounts receivable  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
we pay particular attention to amounts outstanding for days and longer 
any account receivable older than days is deemed uncollectible and written off or fully reserved unless we have specific information from the payer 
table of contents that payment for those amounts is forthcoming or other evidence which we believe supports the collection of amounts older than days 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific payer s inability to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific addition to our allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
under certain of our contracts  billings do not coincide with revenue recognized on the contract due to payer administrative issues 
these unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recorded for which no amount has been invoiced and for which we expect an invoice will not be provided to the payer within the normal billing cycle 
all unbilled amounts are expected to be billed within one year 
our write off experience for the year ended december  was less than of revenue  and for the years ended december  and was approximately and of revenue  respectively 
our write off experience increased from to due to the write off in of approximately million of revenue recognized in the amount of approximately million in each of and under our annual block purchase contract with cpsa in excess of the annual funding allocation amount 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets when we acquire a business our pricing is typically based upon a multiple of its historical ebitda and over the years we have been a successful competitor using this basis for determining the value of and price paid for our acquisitions 
we believe this pricing method is also used by our competitors to value their business combinations and is typical in the mergers and acquisition market 
during the six months ended december   we believe the market for mergers and acquisitions deteriorated such that by the end of  the ebitda multiples being used to price acquisitions had dropped to approximately half of what they had been for us historically 
in addition  during the six months ended december   we had a significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization due to the decrease in the market price of our common stock 
we believe this decrease in stock price resulted primarily from our lower than anticipated financial results during such period 
these financial results were caused by significant changes in the climate of our business  the uncertainty in the state governmental payer environment  the impact of related budgetary decisions  and by the sharp down turn in the united states economy generally 
the million non cash asset impairment charge recorded by us for the year ended december   all of which was recorded during the six months ended december   reflects the magnitude of both the decline in our market capitalization and the deterioration of the mergers and acquisitions market including peer group guideline company multiples of ebitda during that six month period  all as explained further below 
the book value of a social services company is typically very low because it generally has few tangible assets 
when we consummate an acquisition  most of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets  including goodwill  of the reporting unit acquired 
the value of the intangible asset portion of the purchase price is then further allocated as follows first we separately value all separately identifiable acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  or sfas  and then any excess value remaining after subtracting the aggregate value of such identifiable intangible assets is allocated to the reporting unit s goodwill 
each year  in connection with our year end asset impairment test  we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization including a reasonable control premium 
as part of this annual impairment test  we also compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  there is an indication of impairment 
if an indication of impairment is identified  the impairment loss  if any  is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination under sfas  as explained above 
similarly conducted interim impairment tests may also be required in advance of our annual impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value  including 
table of contents goodwill  of one or more of our reporting units below the reporting unit s carrying value 
such circumstances could include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the climate of our business  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
at september   we determined that the decline in our market capitalization and significant change in our business climate each discussed in the first paragraph of this section during the three months ended september  were impairment indicators under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required as of such date 
in determining whether we had goodwill impairment at september   we reduced the total aggregate carrying value of our reporting units to reconcile it to our substantially decreased market capitalization plus a reasonable control premium as of september  we estimated the current fair value of each individual reporting unit with a goodwill balance as of september  using a market based valuation approach 
the results of our interim goodwill impairment test indicated that goodwill related to our december acquisition of logisticare  which comprises our net services operating segment and reporting unit  and earlier acquisitions assigned to our social services operating segment was impaired 
as a result  we recorded an estimated non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our net services reporting unit and million related to our social services operating segment 
as our stock price continued to significantly decline due to the reasons outlined above during the three months ended december   we further reduced the aggregate carrying value of our reporting units in connection with our annual asset impairment analysis to reconcile it to our reduced market capitalization as of december  in subsequently determining whether or not we had goodwill impairment to report for the three months ended december   we considered both a market based valuation approach and an income based valuation approach when estimating the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill balances as of such date 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using one or more methods based on current values in the market for similar businesses 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the cash flow streams expected to be generated by the reporting unit over an appropriate period and then discounting the cash flows to present value using an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimates of future revenue and expenses  growth rates and discount rates 
in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units in our social services operating segment  greater weight was attributed to the market approach due to the continuing market deterioration reflected in current market comparables 
for these reporting units  we weighted the market based valuation results at and the income based valuation results at 
in arriving at the fair value for our net services operating segment  we used the indications of value received by us from potential acquirers of this segment as they represent prices that market participants are willing to offer for this reporting unit under current market conditions 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in an additional non cash asset impairment charge for the three months ended december  of approximately million net of a million adjustment to the estimated interim period goodwill impairment charge recognized at september  as a result of our completing the interim goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of related to goodwill in our social services operating segment 
as a result of both our interim and annual impairment tests  we recorded a total goodwill impairment charge for the year ended december  of million  which is included in asset impairment charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
of this non cash impairment charge  approximately million was related to our social service operating segment and approximately million was related to our net services operating segment 
in connection with our acquisitions  we also allocate a portion of the purchase consideration to management contracts  customer relationships  restrictive covenants  software licenses and developed technology based on the direct or indirect contribution to future cash flows on a discounted cash flow basis expected from these intangible assets over their respective useful lives 

table of contents we assess whether any relevant factors limit the period over which acquired assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows for amortization purposes and determine an appropriate useful life for acquired customer relationships based on the expected period of time we will provide services to the payer 
while we use discounted cash flows to value intangible assets  we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization to determine amortization expense 
if applicable  we assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets based on undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this analysis indicates that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of any long lived asset is recognized as an impairment loss 
in connection with our interim asset impairment analysis conducted as of september   we determined that  for the same reasons noted above related to our goodwill impairment analysis as of such date  the value of the customer relationships acquired in connection with our acquisition of logisticare was impaired as of september  consequently  in addition to the interim goodwill impairment charge noted above  we recorded an million non cash interim asset impairment charge for the three months ended september  to reflect the excess of the carrying value of customer relationships acquired in connection with our acquisition of logisticare over the estimated fair value of such relationships 
we estimated the fair values of these intangible assets on a projected discounted cash flow basis 
in connection with our annual asset impairment analysis conducted as of december   we determined that the same factors that required us to conduct goodwill impairment tests with respect to our reporting units as of december  also required us to conduct impairment tests with respect to the other intangible assets in these reporting units 
in conducting such tests  we compared the undiscounted cash flow associated with each such intangible asset over its remaining life to the carrying value of such asset 
if there was an indication of impairment  a discounted cash flow analysis was performed to determine the fair value of the intangible asset as of december   which was then compared to its carrying value 
we determined  as a result of such comparisons  that there were additional asset impairment losses as of december  in our social services operating segment related to these other intangible assets  and  accordingly  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million for the three months ended december  related to these other intangible assets 
as a result of both our interim and annual impairment tests  we recorded a total asset impairment charge related to other intangible assets for the year ended december  of million  which is included in asset impairment charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
this non cash impairment charge includes the million recorded with respect to our net services operating segment as of september  and the million recorded with respect to our social services operating segment as of december  accrued transportation costs transportation costs are estimated and accrued in the month the services are rendered by outsourced providers utilizing gross reservations for transportation services less cancellations  and average costs per transportation service by customer contract 
average costs per contract are derived by utilizing historical cost trends 
actual costs relating to a specific accounting period are monitored and compared to estimated accruals 
adjustments to those accruals are made based on reconciliations with actual costs incurred 
accounting for management agreement relationships due to the nature of our business and the requirement or desire by certain payers to contract with not for profit social services organizations  we sometimes enter into management contracts with not for profit social services organizations where we provide them with business development  administrative  program and other management services 
these not for profit organizations contract directly with state and local agencies to supply a variety of community based mental health and foster care services to children and adults 
each of these organizations is separately incorporated and organized with its own independent board of directors 

table of contents our management agreements with these not for profit organizations typically require us to provide management  accounting  advisory  supportive  consultative and administrative services  require us to provide the necessary resources to effectively manage the business and services provided  require that we hire  supervise and terminate personnel  review existing personnel policies and assist in adopting and implementing progressive personnel policies  and compensate us with a management fee in exchange for the services provided 
all of our management services are subject to the approval or direction of the managed entities board of directors 
the accounting for our relationships with these organizations is based on a number of judgments regarding certain facts related to the control of these organizations and the terms of our management agreements 
any significant changes in the facts upon which these judgments are based could have a significant impact on our accounting for these relationships 
we have concluded that our management agreements do not meet the provisions of emerging issues task force  application of fasb statement no 
and apb opinion no 
to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with consolidated management agreements  or the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised  or interpretation no 
r  thus the operations of these organizations are not consolidated with our operations 
we will evaluate the impact of the provisions of interpretation no 
r  if any  on future acquired management agreements 
loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs and the general and professional liability and workers compensation costs of certain designated entities we manage under reinsurance programs though our wholly owned subsidiary spcic 
spcic is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of arizona 
spcic maintains reserves for obligations related to our reinsurance programs for our general and professional liability and workers compensation coverage 
as of december  and  we had reserves of approximately million and million  respectively  for the general and professional liability and workers compensation programs 
in addition  provado insurance services  inc  or provado  a wholly owned subsidiary of logisticare  is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of south carolina 
provado provides reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to various members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties within our net services operating segment 
provado maintains reserves for obligations related to the reinsurance programs for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage 
as of december  and  provado had reserves of approximately million and million  respectively 
these reserves are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as reinsurance liability reserves 
we utilize analyses prepared by third party administrators and independent actuaries based on historical claims information with respect to the general and professional liability coverage  workers compensation coverage  automobile liability  automobile physical damage  and health insurance coverage 
we also maintain a self funded health insurance program provided to our employees 
with respect to this program  we consider historical and projected medical utilization data when estimating our health insurance program liability and related expense 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserve for our self funded health insurance programs 

table of contents we continually analyze our reserves for incurred but not reported claims  and for reported but not paid claims related to our reinsurance and self funded insurance programs 
we believe our reserves are adequate 
however  significant judgment is involved in assessing these reserves such as assessing historical paid claims  average lags between the claims incurred date  reported dates and paid dates  and the frequency and severity of claims 
we are at risk for differences between actual settlement amounts and recorded reserves and any resulting adjustments are included in expense once a probable amount is known 
there were no significant adjustments recorded in the periods covered by this report 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these programs above our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments at fair value 
with respect to stock option awards  the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and amortized over the option s vesting periods 
the black scholes merton option pricing formula requires us to make assumptions for the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  life of options and risk free interest rate 
we adopted the requirements of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
we use the short cut method described in fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards in accordance with the effective date and transition provisions thereof related to our calculation of the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of statement r  or apic pool 
sfas r requires an entity to include the net excess tax benefits that would have qualified as such had the entity adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for recognition purposes 
there was no effect on our financial results for or related to the application of the short cut method to determine our apic pool balance 
under sfas r  the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the estimated tax benefit of compensation costs recognized in the income statement for those options are classified as financing cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the amount of excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options was approximately million and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we had a net tax shortfall resulting from the exercise of stock options of approximately million net of approximately  in excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options 
the excess tax benefit amounts for the years ended december   and are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our long term incentive plan  as amended  or plan  allows us the flexibility to issue up to  shares of our common stock pursuant to awards of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  unrestricted stock  stock units including restricted stock units and performance awards to employees  directors  consultants  advisors and others who are in a position to make contributions to our success and to encourage such persons to take into account our long term interests and the interests of our stockholders through ownership of our common stock or securities with value tied to our common stock 
on december   the committee approved  effective as of that date  the acceleration of the vesting dates of all outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock previously awarded to eligible employees  directors and consultants  including those previously awarded to our executive officers and non employee directors  under our plan 
all other terms of the stock options and restricted stock previously awarded remained the same and no options were repriced 
in connection with the approval of the acceleration of these 
table of contents unvested stock options and restricted stock awards  the committee considered  among other things  the anticipated boost to employee morale expected to result from such action 
the committee also noted that such acceleration would eliminate the company s recognition of any stock compensation expense with respect to these options and awards in future fiscal years 
as a result of the vesting acceleration  we estimate that we will avoid recognizing a stock based compensation expense of approximately million in  million in and  in foreign currency translation the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiary are measured using the foreign subsidiary s local currency as the functional currency 
revenues and expenses of this subsidiary are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation gain and loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders equity  unless there is a sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign investment 
presently  it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary in foreign operations 
therefore  we are not providing for us or additional foreign withholding taxes on our foreign subsidiary s undistributed earnings 
generally  such earnings become subject to us tax upon the remittance of dividends and under other circumstances 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability on such undistributed earnings due to the complexities of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or irc  rules and regulations and the hypothetical nature of the calculations 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we hold a derivative financial instrument for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk 
the type of risk hedged relates to the variability of future earnings and cash flows caused by movements in interest rates applied to our floating rate long term debt 
we documented our risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge and will continue to assess its effectiveness during the term of the hedge 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are reported at fair value 
we measure hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
the gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge ie change in fair value is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the remaining gain or loss of the ineffective portion of the hedge  if any  is recognized currently in earnings 
the fair value of the cash flow hedging instrument was a liability of approximately million as of december   which was classified as current portion of interest rate swap and other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined by the liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance which includes amounts for state and federal net operating loss carryforwards for which we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in the ordinary course of operations 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense 

table of contents results of operations segment reporting 
our operations are organized and reviewed by our chief operating decision maker along our service lines in two reportable segments ie  social services and net services 
we operate these reportable segments as separate divisions and differentiate the segments based on the nature of the services they offer 
the following describes each of our segments 
social services social services includes government sponsored social services that we have historically offered 
primary services in this segment include home and community based counseling  foster care and not for profit management services 
our operating entities within social services provide services to a common customer group  principally individuals and families 
all of our operating entities within social services follow similar operating procedures and methods in managing their operations and each operating entity works within a similar regulatory environment  primarily under medicaid regulations 
we manage our operating activities within social services by actual to budget comparisons within each operating entity rather than by comparison between entities 
in  our actual operating contribution margins by operating entity within social services range from approximately to 
we believe that the long term operating contribution margins of our operating entities that comprise social services will approximate between and as the respective entities markets mature  we cross sell our services within markets  and standardize our operating model among entities including recent acquisitions 
we also believe that our targeted contribution margin of approximately is allowable by our state and local governmental payers over the long term 
our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial and non financial information for each individual entity within social services 
while financial performance in comparison to budget is evaluated on an entity by entity basis  our operating entities comprising social services are aggregated into one reporting segment for financial reporting purposes because we believe that the operating entities exhibit similar long term financial performance 
in addition  our revenues  costs and contribution margins are not significantly affected by allocating more or less resources to individual operating entities within social services because the economic characteristics of our business are substantially dependent upon individualized market demographics which affect the amount and type of services in demand as well as our cost structure eg  payroll and contract rates with payers 
in conjunction with the financial performance trends  we believe the similar qualitative characteristics of the operating entities we aggregate within social services and budgetary constraints of our payers in each market provide a foundation to conclude that the entities that we aggregate within social services have similar economic characteristics 
thus  we believe the economic characteristics of our operating entities within social services meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reporting segment under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
net services net services includes managing the delivery of non emergency transportation services 
we operate net services as a separate division with operational management and service offerings distinct from our social services operating segment 

table of contents the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated total revenues represented by items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented year ended december  revenues home and community based services foster care services management fees non emergency transportation services total revenues operating expenses client service expense cost of non emergency transportation services general and administrative expense asset impairment charge depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss non operating expense income interest expense income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues year ended december  percent change home and community based services foster care services management fees non emergency transportation services total revenues home and community based services 
the acquisition of aw in september added approximately million to home and community based services revenue for as compared to in addition  the acquisition of wcg international ltd  or wcg  in august  and family children s services  inc  or fcs  in october  added  on an aggregate basis  approximately million to home and community based services revenue for as compared to excluding the business acquisitions noted above our home and community based services provided additional revenue of approximately million for as compared to this increase was primarily due to the net effect of client volume increases in new and existing locations  rate increases for services provided  reductions in funding from north carolina and indiana  and implementation of managed care initiatives in pennsylvania 

table of contents foster care services 
the acquisition of ccc in september added approximately million to foster care services revenue for as compared to the operations of maple star oregon  or mso  that we consolidated effective may  contributed approximately million of foster care services revenue for compared to approximately million for our cross selling and recruiting efforts  offset by state budget constraints and state foster care program restructuring  resulted in an increase in foster care services revenue of approximately million for as compared to we are increasing our efforts to recruit additional foster care homes in many of our markets which we expect will increase our foster care service offerings 
management fees 
revenue for entities we manage but do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes managed entity revenue increased to million for as compared to million for the net increase of approximately  in management fees from and was primarily attributable to the effect of business growth of the not for profit entities we managed and offset by decreases in fees earned due to the acquisition and consolidation of ccc in september during  british columbia took steps to strictly enforce a contractually imposed revenue cap on a per client basis and contractually mandated pass throughs resulting in an approximate cad million dispute and also provided notice of termination of one of its six provincial contracts with wcg 
we are disputing these actions in accordance with the contractually mandated arbitration provision 
non emergency transportation services 
we generated all of our non emergency transportation services revenue for and through our net services operating segment as a result of the acquisition of logisticare  in december a significant portion of this revenue is generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the transportation needs of a specific geographic population 
due to the fixed revenue stream and variable expense base structure of our net services operating segment  expenses related to this segment vary with seasonal fluctuations in demand for our non emergency transportation services and  as a result  such expenses fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
we expect our operating results will fluctuate in relation to seasonal demand for our non emergency transportation services 
budgetary issues of certain state government agencies that fund our non emergency transportation services have resulted in delays in some contract implementations and awards to provide non emergency transportation services 
in addition  as the economy has worsened  our net services operating segment has experienced a higher level of utilization which has resulted in higher costs to deliver transportation services 
higher fuel prices during the summer of also contributed to higher costs to deliver transportation services 
without offsetting rate increases from our payers these higher costs have resulted in lower operating margins 
while these negative trends provide a basis from which we can renegotiate rates with our payers for our services  these negotiations are uncertain  often protracted and can extend over quarters and often fiscal year ends 
as a result  and due to the lack of visibility in state budgets  there may not be opportunities to mitigate the effects of these trends on the operating results of our net services operating segment until such time that rate increases are enacted 
operating expenses client service expense 
client service expense included the following for the years ended december  and year ended december  percent change payroll and related costs purchased services other operating expenses stock based compensation total client service expense 
table of contents payroll and related costs 
our payroll and related costs increased for as compared to  as we added new direct care providers  administrative staff and other employees to support our growth 
in addition  we added over new employees in connection with the acquisition of ccc and aw  which resulted in an increase in payroll and related costs of approximately million in the aggregate for as compared to further  we added over new employees in connection with the acquisition of wcg and fcs  and the consolidation of mso in may  which resulted in an increase in payroll and related costs of approximately million in the aggregate for as compared to as a percentage of revenue  excluding net services revenue  payroll and related costs increased from for to for due to the increase in the number of employees 
purchased services 
since acquiring wcg in august  we subcontract with a network of providers for a portion of the workforce development services we provide throughout british columbia 
in addition  we incur a variety of other support service expenses in the normal course of placing clients in the workforce 
for  these services added approximately million to purchased services as compared to additionally  increases in foster parent payments accounted for an increase in purchased services for as compared to of approximately million 
increases in foster parent payments are primarily attributable to the acquisition of ccc in september and the consolidation of mso in may as a percentage of revenue  excluding net services revenue  purchased services increased from for to for primarily due to higher purchased services costs related to the operations of wcg and an increase in foster parent payments 
other operating expenses 
the acquisition of ccc and aw in and wcg and fcs in  and the consolidation of mso in may added approximately million to other operating expenses for as compared to in addition  increased client mileage and client transportation expense of approximately million due to the addition of new school based programs and higher fuel costs during the summer season  and increased bad debt expense of million also contributed to the increase in other operating expenses as compared to in certain of our social services markets we have experienced collection issues related to delayed payments that have resulted from payer budget issues 
many of our troubled accounts receivable aged beyond days during or were determined to be uncollectible 
as a result  and in keeping with our allowance for doubtful accounts policy of reserving all amounts older than days unless we have specific information from the payer that payment for those amounts is forthcoming or other evidence which we believe supports the collection of amounts older than days  we reserved these amounts as uncollectible as of december   which accounted for the increase in bad debt expense for as compared to as a percentage of revenue  excluding net services revenue  other operating expenses increased from for to for primarily due to the addition of new locations resulting from our organic growth  increased bad debt expense and higher costs related to the operations of ccc  aw  wcg and fcs 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation of approximately million for represents the amortization of the fair value of stock options and stock grants awarded to executive officers and employees under our plan 
in addition  the committee approved the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock awards as of december  of the total stock based compensation expense of approximately million related to the accelerated vesting  approximately million was expensed as part of client service expense 
of this amount approximately  was attributable to stock based compensation awards to certain of our executive officers 
cost of non emergency transportation services 
year ended december  payroll and related costs purchased services other operating expenses total client service expense 
table of contents with the acquisition of logisticare in december  we added over  new employees which resulted in payroll and related costs related to our net services operating segment of approximately million for through our net services operating segment we subcontract with a number of third party transportation providers to provide non emergency transportation services to our clients 
for  purchased transportation costs amounted to approximately million  or of the total net services operating segment revenue 
in addition  other operating expenses of our net services operating segment were approximately million for as a percentage of net services revenue  the cost of non emergency transportation services increased from for to for the cost of non emergency transportation services as a percentage of net services revenue for reflects the impact of seasonally low costs to provide non emergency transportation services during the holiday season relative to the revenue contribution as compared to a full year of costs for relative to revenue contribution  which accounts for most of the increase in the cost of non emergency transportation services as a percentage of net services revenue from to in addition  as the economy worsened in  our net services operating segment experienced a higher level of utilization which resulted in higher costs to deliver transportation services 
additionally  higher fuel prices during the summer season also contributed to higher costs to deliver transportation services 
without offsetting rate increases from our payers these higher costs represented a larger percentage of net services revenue for as compared to historical periods 
general and administrative expense 
year ended december  percent change the addition of corporate staff to adequately support our growth  increased costs to provide services under our management agreements and higher rates of pay for employees accounted for an increase of approximately million of corporate administrative expenses for as compared to stock based compensation increased approximately million from  which represents the amortization of the fair value of stock options and stock grants awarded to executive officers and employees under our plan 
stock based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting discussed above accounted for approximately million of the increase from of this amount  approximately million was attributable to stock based compensation awards to our executive officers and non employee members of our board of directors 
also contributing to the increase in corporate administrative expenses were legal expense  bank service charges  insurance related expenses  professional fees  and accounting fees related to logisticare amounting to approximately million 
in addition  as a result of our growth during  rent and facilities costs increased million for mostly due to our acquisition activities 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense decreased from for to for due to the effect of lower incremental general and administrative expense of our net services operating segment relative to its total revenue contribution 
asset impairment charge during  we experienced a significant and sustained decline in market capitalization due to the decrease in the market price of our common stock resulting  we believe  primarily from lower than anticipated financial results during such period caused by significant changes in the climate of our business  including the uncertainty in the state payer environment and the impact of related budgetary decisions  as well as by the sharp down turn in the united states economy generally 
we determined that these factors indicated an impairment loss related to goodwill as of september  as a result  we initiated an interim impairment analysis of the fair value of goodwill and determined that  based on this analysis  goodwill was impaired as of september  accordingly  we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge 
in addition to the goodwill impairment charge for the three months ended september   we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of customer relationships based on their estimated fair values for the same period 

table of contents we performed our annual test of impairment of goodwill and an impairment analysis of other intangible assets as of december   based on the same triggering events that gave rise to our interim test for impairment of goodwill and determined that an additional goodwill impairment charge of approximately million and an intangible impairment charge of approximately million were necessary for as a result of both our interim and annual impairment tests  we recorded a total asset impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets for the year ended december  of million 
a more detailed discussion of these impairment charges is set forth above under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates above 
depreciation and amortization

due to our acquisition of logisticare in december  our current and long term debt obligations were approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
since we acquired logisticare in december  we recorded interest expense related to our increased long term debt for less than one month for as compared to a full twelve months for as a result  interest expense including the amortization of deferred financing costs for was higher than in due to a higher level of debt during as compared to interest income 
interest income for and was approximately  and million  respectively  and resulted primarily from interest earned on interest bearing bank and money market accounts 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on our estimated annual effective income tax rate for the full fiscal year equal to approximately for as compared to approximately for our estimated annual effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible permanent differences  foreign taxes and state income taxes 
for  approximately million of the total goodwill impairment charge of approximately million is not deductible for income tax purposes as the goodwill is related to our acquisition of the equity interest in several businesses 
as a result  our effective income tax rate for decreased 
at december   we had future tax benefits of million related to million of available federal net operating loss carryforwards which expire in years through and million of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in through as a result of statutory ownership changes as defined for purposes of section of the irc  our ability to utilize our net operating losses is restricted

quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenues operating income net income earnings loss per share basic diluted managed entity revenue management fees quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenues operating income loss net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted managed entity revenue management fees managed entity revenue represents revenues of the not for profit social services organizations we manage 
although these revenues are not our revenues  because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and a significant portion of our management fees is based on a percentage of their revenues  we believe that the presentation of managed entity revenue provides investors with an additional measure of the size of the operations under our administration and can help them understand trends in our management fee revenue 
as a result of our acquisition of substantially all of the assets in illinois and indiana of ccc on september   we began consolidating the financial results of these operations on october   which accounts for a decrease of approximately million in managed entity revenue for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended september  the acquisition of wcg in august added approximately million and million to home and community based services revenue for the three months ended september and december   respectively 
in addition  mso  a not for profit organization managed by us which we began consolidating for financial reporting purposes on may   contributed approximately  and  to foster care services revenue for the three months ended september and december   respectively 
the increase in home and community based services revenue for the three months ended september  and december  from these business acquisitions was partially offset by a seasonal decline in revenue due to lower client demand for our home and community based services during the summer and holiday seasons 

table of contents the acquisition of fcs in october added approximately million to home and community based services revenue for the three months ended december  additionally  we acquired logisticare in december and added non emergency transportation services to our continuum of services 
this acquisition added approximately million of non emergency transportation services revenue to our total revenue and approximately million of operating income for the three months ended december  we incurred additional debt to fund our acquisition of logisticare in december which resulted in increased interest expense and other debt service charges of approximately million for the three months ended december  included in total revenue for the three months ended march  was non emergency transportation services revenue of approximately million related to our acquisition of logisticare in december  which comprises our net services operating segment 
in addition  operating income of approximately million was attributable to the operations of net services 
the quarterly period ended march  was the first full quarter in which we consolidated the financial results of logisticare 
revenues from our home and community based services declined approximately million as compared to the first and second quarters of due to lower client demand for our home and community based services during the summer season 
due to the significant and sustained decline in market capitalization and the uncertainty in the state payer environment as well as the impact of related budgetary decisions on our earnings during the six months ended december   we initiated asset impairment tests and  based on the results  we determined that a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired and recorded an asset impairment charge for each of the three month periods ended september  and december  based on a preliminary and subsequent annual asset impairment analysis 
for a complete discussion of the asset impairment charges for  see accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates above 
the acquisition of ccc and aw effective september  added  in the aggregate  approximately million home and community based services and foster care services revenue for the three months ended december  the increase in home and community based services and foster care services revenues for the three months ended december  from these business acquisitions was partially offset by a seasonal decline in revenue due to lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday season 
the decline in management fees for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended september  was primarily due to our acquisition and consolidation of substantially all of the assets in illinois and indiana of ccc on september  seasonality our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business 
in our social services operating segment  lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday and summer seasons generally results in lower revenue during those periods  however  our expenses related to the social services operating segment do not vary significantly with these changes 
as a result  our social services operating segment experiences lower operating margins during the holiday and summer seasons 
our net services operating segment also experiences fluctuations in demand for our non emergency transportation services during the summer  winter and holiday seasons 
due to higher demand in the summer months and lower demand in the winter and holiday seasons  coupled with a fixed revenue stream based on a per member per month base structure  our net services operating segment experiences lower operating margins in the summer season and higher operating margins in the winter and holiday seasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the seasonal demand for our home and community based services and non emergency transportation services 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive response by other social services and transportation providers

management agreements we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations that require us to provide management and administrative services for each organization 
in exchange for these services  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
the not for profit social services organizations managed by us that qualify under section c of the internal revenue code  referred to as a c entity  each maintain a board of directors  a majority of which are independent 
all economic decisions by the board of any c entity that affect us are made solely by the independent board members 
our management agreements with each c entity are typically subject to third party fairness opinions from an independent appraiser retained by the independent board members of the tax exempt organizations 
management fees generated under our management agreements represented and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in accordance with our management agreements with these not for profit organizations  we have obligations to manage their business and services 
management fee receivable at december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and management fee revenue was recognized on all of these receivables 
in order to enhance liquidity of the entities we manage  we may allow the managed entities to defer payment of their respective management fees 
in addition  since government contractors who provide social or similar services to government beneficiaries sometimes experience collection delays due to either lack of proper documentation of claims  government budgetary processes or similar reasons outside the contractors control either directly or as managers of other contracting entities  we generally do not consider a management fee receivable to be uncollectible due solely to its age until it is days old 

table of contents the following is a summary of the aging of our management fee receivable balances as of december   march  june  september  and december  at less than days days days days over days december  march  june  september  december  each month we examine each of our managed entities with regard to its solvency  outlook and ability to pay us any outstanding management fees 
if the likelihood that we will not be paid is other than remote  we defer the recognition of these management fees until we are certain that payment is probable 
our days sales outstanding for our managed entities decreased from days at december  to days at december  on september   we acquired substantially all of the assets of ccc s illinois and indiana operations 
the purchase price of approximately million consisted of cash of approximately  with the remaining million credited against the purchase price for all of ccc s indebtedness to us for management services we rendered to ccc under several management services agreements 
historically  we have provided various management services to ccc for a fee under separate management services agreements for each state in which ccc operated 
in connection with our acquisition of the assets of ccc s illinois and indiana operations  we consolidated the remaining management services agreements with ccc ie  florida  ohio and texas into one administrative service agreement under which we will provide a more narrow range of services to ccc as compared to the services historically provided by us 
as a result  management fees receivable from ccc decreased by approximately million 
amounts due from ccc were approximately  at december  and represented approximately of our total management fee receivable at december  the remaining million balance of our total management fee receivable at december  was due from intervention services  inc  rio grande behavioral health services  inc  or rio grande  including certain members of the rio grande behavioral health network  the redco group  care development of maine  fcp  inc  family preservation community services  inc  maple star colorado  inc  and alternative opportunities  inc 
we have deemed payment of all of the foregoing receivables to be probable based on our collection history with these entities as the long term manager of their operations 
reinsurance and self funded insurance programs reinsurance we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs and the general and professional liability and workers compensation costs of certain designated entities we manage under reinsurance programs through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  social services providers captive insurance company  or spcic 
we also provide reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to certain members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties under our net services segment through provado insurance services  inc  or provado 
provado  a wholly owned subsidiary of logisticare  is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of south carolina 
the decision to reinsure our risks and provide a self funded health insurance program to our employees was made based on current conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of self insurance retentions  increasing number of coverage limitations  and fluctuating insurance premium rates 

table of contents spcic spcic  which is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of arizona  reinsures third party insurers for general and professional liability exposures for the first dollar of each and every loss up to million per loss and million in the aggregate

the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception in of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately  the excess premium over our expected losses may be used to fund spcic s operating expenses  fund any deficit arising in workers compensation liability coverage  provide for surplus reserves  and to fund any other risk management activities 
spcic reinsures a third party insurer for worker s compensation insurance for the first dollar of each and every loss up to  per occurrence with no annual aggregate limit 
the third party insurer provides a deductible buy back policy with a limit of  per occurrence that provides coverage for all states where coverage is required 
the gross written premium for this policy at december  and was million and million  respectively  which was ceded to spcic 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception in of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately million 
our expected losses related to workers compensation and general and professional liability in excess of our liability under our associated reinsurance programs at december  was approximately million 
we recorded a corresponding liability at december  which offsets these expected losses 
spcic had restricted cash of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which was restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses of spcic under the general and professional liability and workers compensation reinsurance programs 
the full extent of claims may not be fully determined for years 
therefore  the estimates of potential obligations are based on recommendations of an independent actuary using historical data  industry data  and our experience 
although we believe that the amounts accrued for losses incurred but not reported under the terms of our reinsurance programs are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with these claims made under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
provado under a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurer  provado reinsures the third party insurer for the first  of each loss for each line of coverage 
provado also reinsures the third party insurer within a finite corridor of  excess of the  layer of coverage 
the reinsurance agreement is subject to an annual aggregate equal to of gross written premium 
the corridor is subject to a million aggregate limit 
the estimated gross written premium is million for the policy year ending january  the third party insurer retains approximately of gross written premium and a ceding commission of 
the liabilities for expected losses and loss adjustment expenses are based primarily on individual case estimates for losses reported by claimants 
an estimate is provided for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported on the basis of claim experience and claim experience of the industry 
these estimates are reviewed at least annually by independent consulting actuaries 
as experience develops and new information becomes known  the estimates are adjusted as necessary 
health insurance we offer our employees an option to participate in a self funded health insurance program 
with respect to our social services operating segment  health claims were self funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability for individual claims to  per person and for a maximum potential claim liability based on member enrollment 
with respect to our net services operating 
table of contents segment  we offer self funded health insurance and dental plans to our employees 
health claims under this program are self funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability to  per incident and a maximum potential claim liability based on member enrollment 
health insurance claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
we maintain accruals for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plan administrator and therefore have not been paid 
the incurred but not reported reserve is based on an established cap and current payment trends of health insurance claims 
the liability for the self funded health plan of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  was recorded in reinsurance liability reserve in our consolidated balance sheets 
we charge our employees a portion of the costs of our self funded group health insurance programs 
we determine this charge at the beginning of each plan year based upon historical and projected medical utilization data 
any difference between our projections and our actual experience is borne by us 
we estimate potential obligations for liabilities under this program to reserve what we believe to be a sufficient amount to cover liabilities based on our past experience 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under this program above what we reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
contractual cash obligations 
the following is a summary of our future contractual cash obligations as of december  at december  contractual cash obligations s total less than year years years after years debt interest purchased services commitments leases total stock repurchase program on february   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to one million shares of our common stock 
since inception  we have spent approximately million to purchase  shares of our common stock on the open market 
we did not purchase shares of our common stock during during the term of the credit agreement we are prohibited from purchasing shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
liquidity matters we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and amended credit agreement provide funds necessary to meet our operating plan for the expected operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses  and interest and projected principal payments on our debt 
in addition  we are focusing on several strategic options to reduce our debt  including the sale of certain non strategic assets  including the sale of logisticare  to generate funds sufficient to pay down a substantial portion of our long term debt 
additionally  we have taken steps to reduce both corporate and client services costs by suspending all pay increases for all of our employees and reducing holiday and sick leave and employee health benefits beginning in further  we intend to refocus our resources on growing our core social services operations 

table of contents we may also access capital markets to raise debt or equity financing for various business reasons  including required debt payments and acquisitions that make both strategic and economic sense 
the timing  term  size  and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing 
in addition  with respect to required debt payments  the amended credit agreement with cit requires that upon receipt of any proceeds from a disposition  involuntary disposition  equity issuance  or debt issuance as defined in the amended credit agreement we must prepay principal then outstanding in an aggregate amount equal to at least of such proceeds except where the disposition requires the consent of the lenders  in which case  the net cash proceeds will be used to prepay outstanding principal 
our liquidity and financial position will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates
