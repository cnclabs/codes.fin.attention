diluted earnings per share average diluted shares outstanding fiscal was the th consecutive year of annual sales and earnings growth for clarcor 
fiscal sales  operating profit and net earnings increased from fiscal by  and  respectively 
operating margins improved slightly to in the company s diversity of filtration businesses and the breadth of its product lines and customer base offset fluctuations during in product demand and material costs in many of its markets primarily caused by domestic and global economic factors 
for most of  demand was strong for filters used in oil and natural gas exploration and transmission  for filters used on aircraft  agricultural  mining and construction machinery  for aviation fuel filtration systems and filters and for dust collector systems and replacement cartridges 
demand for filters sold to the over the road truck market  railroad market and automobile manufacturers and automotive parts suppliers was lower in compared to overseas  and mostly in asia  growth was solid in overall  however  the pace began to slow towards the end of the year compared to and earlier in although the company experienced significant cost increases in metals  petroleum based products  energy  natural gas  resins  adhesives  packaging materials and filter media during the first three quarters of fiscal  it was able to implement price increases and cost reduction initiatives to offset most cost increases and slightly improve its operating margin over during the fourth quarter of fiscal  prices declined for these commodities but the impact to the company input costs was not significant due to outstanding purchase orders 
the company expects to realize cost reductions for purchases of these raw materials beginning in early on december   the company acquired perry equipment corporation peco  a privately owned manufacturer of engineered filtration products and technologies used in a wide array of industries  including oil and natural gas  refining  power generation  petrochemical  food and beverage  electronics  polymers  pulp and paper 
peco is based in mineral wells  texas with operations in mexico  canada  the united kingdom  italy  romania  malaysia and china 
peco was merged with the company s facet operations with the combined headquarters based in mineral wells 
peco was acquired to expand the company s product offerings  technology  filtration solutions and customer base in the oil and natural gas industry 
its results are included as part of the company s industrial environmental filtration segment since the date of its acquisition 
the purchase price was approximately million including acquisition costs and excluding million of cash acquired 
the company issued  shares of clarcor common stock with a value of approximately million and paid the remaining purchase price with cash on hand of million and approximately million of cash borrowed under the company s multi currency revolving credit agreement 
the peco acquisition added approximately million of sales and million of operating profit in effective may   the company acquired a share in bioprocess ho llc bpt  a rhode island based manufacturer of industrial waste water and water reuse filtration systems  for million  payable million in cash with the remaining million to be paid by december  under the terms of the agreement with bpt  the company has the right  but not the obligation  to acquire additional ownership shares and eventually complete ownership of the company over several years at a price based on  among other factors  bpt s operating income 
the investment  with a carrying value of approximately million  is being accounted for under the equity method 
the company s share of bpt s earnings since the acquisition date is immaterial 
the following are other significant items that occurred during the periods presented in fiscal  the company recognized a gain on insurance proceeds of approximately million  or per diluted share  due to weather related property damage at four of its facilities 
other expense in included a million charge related to a mark to market adjustment on a two year interest rate swap which will reverse in total over the next thirteen months  reducing interest expense over that period 
the actual impact in any given quarter during is subject to short term interest rates 
in addition  the company incurred approximately million more in interest expense in compared to the prior year as a result of debt incurred to purchase peco and to repurchase company stock early in fiscal the company began a restructuring program in for its heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac filter operations primarily to rationalize and relocate certain hvac filter manufacturing plants to improve operating efficiencies and reduce manufacturing and transportation costs 
as a part of this plan  the company discontinued production at facilities in iowa and north carolina in and incurred approximately million in costs  including a pension plan curtailment charge 
the company also incurred million of additional pension expense related to remeasurement of its pension plan assets and obligations at the time of curtailment 
in fiscal  the company recognized one time tax benefits of million  or per diluted share  of which million was recorded in the third quarter of and was related to the completion of various income tax audits and the finalization of certain income tax liabilities 
the other million was recorded in the first quarter of and related to the passage of the research and experimentation tax credit extension 
during fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to operating profit related to a customer s refusal to pay for products it had ordered and used 
in addition  the company terminated a million annual sales contract with this customer 
the company settled the resulting lawsuit during the specific terms of the settlement are confidential 
operating results sales net sales in fiscal were  million  a increase from million in fiscal the sales increase was the nd consecutive year of sales growth for the company 
acquisitions during and contributed an incremental million to sales in fluctuations in foreign currencies increased sales in by less than  or million 
in  fluctuations in foreign currencies increased sales by approximately  or million

change net sales dollars in millions total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging the engine mobile filtration segment s sales increased in from and in from fluctuations in foreign currencies added approximately million to sales for this segment in compared to approximately million of the increase and million of the increase was due to the acquisition of an ownership share in sinfa sa sinfa  a manufacturer of automotive and heavy duty engine filters based in casablanca  morocco 
heavy duty engine filter sales through independent distributors  in both domestic and international aftermarkets  original equipment manufacturer dealers  truck fleets and national accounts were about even with s sales 
sales to domestic trucking companies were slow in north america during and began softening in the rest of the world towards the end of fiscal filter markets for off road applications for construction  mining and agricultural equipment were stronger in and than in as economic conditions in these markets slowed during the latter part of heavy duty engine filter sales grew in mexico  south africa and china by double digits in although growth slowed towards the end of compared to earlier in the year 
heavy duty engine filter sales in europe were relatively unchanged for fiscal year overall compared to fiscal railroad filter sales declined slightly in from levels 
the company expects the commercial rail industry to remain soft through most of as economic pressures continue in the coal  housing and automotive sectors  which are important to the railroad industry 
construction activity is also expected to remain slow in the company anticipates over the road trucking will rebound slightly towards the end of as lower fuel prices reduce the costs to ship products 
however  the company expects that will be an exceptionally difficult year for the us and world economies and that in the first fiscal quarter of  the company will report lower sales and operating profit than in the first quarter of in this segment 
the segment implemented price increases in for its products in response to high energy costs and rising raw material costs  particularly with respect to various grades and types of steel  filter media and oil based raw materials 
the segment will continue to evaluate further price changes in response to changing commodity costs 
over the road truck mileage and railroad traffic began softening in the united states in  however  international engine mobile filtration operations  led by sales increases of over in china  australia and europe  recorded higher sales in than new product introductions and the breadth of the segment s filter product line also contributed to sales growth in from approximately million of the sales increase was due to the weakening of the us dollar during compared to there was no material impact from currency fluctuations in price increases averaged to in there were no significant price increases in the company s industrial environmental filtration segment reported increased sales of million or in from and decreased sales of million or in from the segment implemented several price increases during to offset rising commodity costs 
approximately million of the increase in sales was due to the peco acquisition 
peco s sales were higher in than its previous fiscal year s sales 
the company experienced strong global demand throughout for peco s filtration products and systems  which are used primarily in the natural gas industry 
however  demand in remains uncertain 
the significant reduction in the cost of oil and natural gas will affect drilling programs and the building of transmission facilities and pipelines over the long term although the impact is expected to be very uneven across geographies 
the company expects less money will be spent on building new facilities if oil and natural gas prices stay at current levels 
the company believes the decline in oil and natural gas prices will eventually result  however  in an increase in usage which would benefit sales of aftermarket filters 
the company s strategy is to focus heavily on the sale of aftermarket products 
demand for the segment s dust collector cartridges  which incorporate protura tm nanofiber technology  continues to grow 
environmental filtration systems and filter sales for aerospace  polymer and fiber  aviation fuel and specialty filter applications also grew by double digits in compared with although the company experienced slower growth in its fourth quarter than earlier in if capital spending due to economic conditions throughout the world continues to be slow  the company expects sales of dust collector systems and other environmental filtration systems to decline in the company also expects sales of resin and fiber filters to be slow for hvac filter sales  especially those used in the automotive manufacturing and residential home building industries  continued to be slow during compared with lower hvac filter sales partially offset the growth in other product lines within the segment 
the company does not expect to see any improvement in hvac filter sales until the economy begins to recover 
sales to automobile manufacturers and automotive parts suppliers were less than of the company s total sales in therefore  the impact of continued weak sales to this industry is not significant to clarcor s total sales 
the weakening of the us dollar during compared to added approximately million to sales in most of the segment s sales decrease in was due to lower sales volume at the company s environmental air filter manufacturing operations 
sales at the company s hvac filter manufacturing operations were lower in than in this was caused by a number of factors including the elimination of certain low margin customers and delays in deliveries to customers due to transitional issues at the company s hvac plants arising from its hvac filter restructuring program 
as part of the hvac filter restructuring program  the company is regionalizing its manufacturing facilities to serve designated areas of the united states with a more complete product line at each facility 
this requires moving equipment between facilities and adding new manufacturing plants  such as the plant in pittston  pennsylvania which began production late in the second quarter of as a result of this activity  the hvac filter plants were sometimes unable to ship customer orders and sales suffered during the company believes it has resolved these delivery problems resulting in improved service levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal excluding the results of the hvac filter manufacturing operations  the company s other industrial environmental filtration operations improved sales by approximately in compared to sales growth occurred  both domestically and internationally  in most product lines including process liquid filters  systems and filter cartridges for the aviation fuel and defense sectors  filters for aerospace applications  specialty filtration  pollution control systems  sand control filters used in off shore oil and gas drilling  filters for plastic and polymer fiber and resin applications and sales to the company s total filtration program customers 
sales of environmental filtration equipment were also stronger in than in in  the company introduced dust collector cartridges containing protura tm nanofiber media  which helped grow sales for this product line in compared to a first quarter acquisition contributed approximately million of sales to the weakening of the us dollar during compared to added approximately million to sales for changes in currency translation rates did not significantly impact sales growth in in addition to the lower hvac filter sales volumes in discussed above  this segment was impacted by the loss of a million annual sales contract with a customer who had refused to pay amounts owed to the company 
the company terminated this contract during the second quarter of approximately million of sales were reported in related to this contract 
in the fourth quarter of  the company settled its litigation against this customer 
the packaging segment s sales of million were slightly higher than s sales of million 
sales did not significantly increase due to continued slow growth in customers sales of their products and delayed new product introductions by the segment s customers  particularly in the confectionary market 
in addition  sales of decorated flat sheet metal  particularly for the film industry  were slow 
sales in decreased million or from the segment s sales were unusually strong at million due to the introduction of a wide array of new packaging designs  primarily in partnership with major consumer product companies  and price increases 
customer demand for fabricated metal packages  combination metal plastic packages and plastic packaging was also stronger in operating profit operating profit for increased to million from the level of million 
although each of the company s segments experienced rising raw materials costs during the year  particularly in steel  resins  adhesives  filter media and packaging materials  they were able to offset most of the cost increases through price adjustments and production improvements 
in addition  the acquisition of peco contributed million to operating profit in in the second quarter of fiscal  four of the company s facilities in three states were damaged in weather related events 
the company recognized a net gain  resulting from the excess of insurance proceeds received over the net book value of the property  of approximately million net of the million deductible paid by the company as a reduction of cost of sales 
the company incurred approximately million in costs  including a pension plan curtailment cost  related to closing hvac filter manufacturing plants in iowa and north carolina during the company also incurred million of additional pension expense related to remeasurement of its pension plan assets and obligations at the time of curtailment 
despite these charges  additional bad debt expense and rising raw materials costs  the company achieved higher operating profit and operating margin for operating margin increased slightly to in compared to in and in although costs for freight and purchased materials  including metal products  filter media and petroleum based products  have increased significantly over the past two years  price increases to customers have been implemented to help offset the cost increases 
during the latter part of  commodity costs related to oil and gas started to decline 
this is expected to have an impact on the company s cost structure for the increase in operating profit for to million was primarily due to higher engine mobile filtration segment sales  increased specialty and process liquid filtration sales and company wide cost reduction efforts that offset losses in the environmental air filter operations 
the cost savings during related to the hvac restructuring were not significant  although the company did realize anticipated savings in fiscal related to a european manufacturing restructuring 
a weakened us dollar in and added approximately million and million  respectively  to operating profit 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on consolidated operating profit in comparative operating profit information related to the company s business segments is as follows 
vs 
change operating profit dollars in millions total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging vs 
change operating profit dollars in millions total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging operating margin as a percent of net sales engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging total the engine mobile filtration segment reported operating profit of million  which was relatively unchanged from profit of million 
operating profit for was impacted by a charge for an insurance deductible recorded in the second quarter of due to a weather related incident  increased legal costs and expense from the expiration of certain sales tax credits offset by lower employee health care  incentive compensation and benefits 
the segment s operating margin of remains strong  although it declined slightly from for due to a decline in domestic sales growth overall and higher international sales growth where margins are somewhat lower than in the united states 
for fiscal  the company expects overall operating margin for this segment to decline slightly 
the weakening of the us dollar for compared to added less than million to operating profit for operating profit for improved from primarily from sales growth and continued cost reduction efforts partially offset by a litigation settlement 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to this segment s operating profit for and was not material 
the industrial environmental filtration segment reported operating profit of million in  an increase over profit of million 
operating margins improved from in to in  a percentage point increase 
the peco acquisition accounted for approximately million of the increase in operating profit 
this segment recognized a gain  resulting from the excess of insurance proceeds received over the net book value of the property  of approximately million net of the million deductible paid by the company as a reduction of cost of sales related to a tornado and hail storm that damaged three of the company s facilities in two states 
the company has completed most of the repairs associated with the hail damage 
the remaining increase in operating profit was due to higher sales of plastic and polymer fiber and resin filters  environmental equipment and replacement cartridge sales and filters used in aviation fuel  aerospace and oil and gas applications 
operating profit in also included the million of costs associated with closing two hvac filter manufacturing plants 
the hvac restructuring program  which began in  is continuing with improved labor and production efficiencies at its hvac operating facilities 
the program s goal is based on achieving significantly improved manufacturing productivity and a lower product cost structure driven by the new equipment which will be installed at every one of the company s hvac filter manufacturing locations 
the restructuring plan includes relocating several hvac filter manufacturing facilities to more closely align their shipments to their customers locations 
this will reduce its inter plant freight costs and transform its hvac filter manufacturing plants into multi product manufacturing facilities to improve product availability and on time shipments to customers 
the company closed two plants during and one plant in it also opened a new plant in pittston  pennsylvania in in early fiscal  the company began consolidating four louisville  kentucky area hvac related facilities into one location in jeffersonville  indiana 
this is expected to be the last major plant consolidation effort in the restructuring plan 
although the company initially anticipated the hvac restructuring program would result in an improvement in operating profit of million annually by the end of  it now believes that this improvement will be delayed until specifically  the company had expected an operating profit at the hvac manufacturing facilities in  which did not occur  although fourth quarter results were significantly better than s fourth quarter results and also better than any other quarter in equipment delivery and installation delays in and and additional time needed to train new employees and improve production processes resulted in slower progress toward the profit improvement goal in and than expected 
the company s goal for is an operating margin for this business of to  and in an operating margin of to 
in addition  the company believes it will reach its goal of an overall operating margin for the industrial environmental filtration segment in most of the equipment that had been ordered for the hvac manufacturing plants throughout the us will be in place and in production by the middle of the industrial environmental filtration segment s operating profit of million and operating margin of were unchanged from the segment s operating results were impacted by lower sales volumes  continued costs to restructure and integrate manufacturing facilities in its hvac filter manufacturing operations  including the start up costs at its new production facility in pennsylvania  and costs related to the relocation of acquired inventory and machinery from the acquisition of the synthetic fiber filtration business of newton tool in february as the company reorganized its hvac filter manufacturing and distribution facilities  integrated plant purchasing  consolidated customer service  moved manufacturing lines and trained new employees  it incurred higher costs than anticipated in the company s hvac filter manufacturing operation increased prices to offset rising material and freight costs during better utilization of the segment s production facilities at non hvac filter manufacturing operations  higher sales in most other non hvac filter operations and a monetary settlement from a lawsuit also contributed to higher margins 
in addition  included the million charge related to a customer s refusal to pay amounts owed to the company and the european restructuring charges of million 
foreign currency translation added approximately million to the operating profit for this segment when compared to the packaging segment s operating profit of million in was higher than the million reported in the increase was primarily due to the implementation of price increases and cost reduction initiatives to offset most of the raw material cost increases 
operating margin of for improved from in the company expects this segment s operating profit and margins in fiscal to be slightly lower than that of based on the economic slowdown continuing 
operating margin was in the strong sales volume in  along with an ongoing focus on improving manufacturing efficiency through closely monitoring productivity measures and implementing cost reduction initiatives  contributed to higher operating profits and margins for fiscal other income expense net other expense totaled million in compared to net other income of million in and million in the most significant change from relates to interest expense of million recorded in related primarily to debt incurred at the beginning of the fiscal year to acquire peco and to repurchase company stock 
interest expense in also included a million charge related to a mark to market adjustment on a two year interest rate swap 
the million charge will reverse over the next thirteen months and reduce interest expense over that period 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate for was compared to in and in during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million credit related to congress passing the research and experimentation tax credit extension 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded a million tax benefit related to a refund it received from one of its overseas subsidiaries arising from changes in certain tax regulations 
the unusually low effective tax rate was due to a tax benefit of approximately million related to the completion of various income tax audits and the finalization of certain income tax liabilities in the third quarter and a cumulative tax benefit of million during the first quarter from the research and experimentation tax credit extension that congress passed in december these one time benefits reduced the effective rate in by approximately 
faster profit growth in international operations with lower tax rates than in the united states  increased tax exempt interest income and a decline in the extraterritorial income exclusion deduction also contributed to a lower tax rate for compared to that of the effective tax rate for was higher due to changes in the deductibility of certain expenses 
the effective tax rate in is expected to be approximately to  which is comparable to that of net earnings and earnings per share net earnings grew to million in  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to million in  or per share on a diluted basis 
net earnings were million in  or diluted earnings per share of 
the increase in diluted average shares outstanding for fiscal compared to was due to the issuance of  shares in the peco acquisition and grants of  shares of stock based incentives offset by the repurchase of  shares and the full year impact of share repurchases in the decrease in diluted average shares outstanding for fiscal compared to was due to the repurchase of  shares in offset by grants of  shares of stock based incentives 
the company repurchased  shares in under the company s share repurchase authorization 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources clarcor s financial position remains strong  with adequate cash resources and sufficient borrowing capacity under its current line of credit 
the global credit market experienced a significant tightening of credit availability and interest rate volatility during fiscal this resulted in reduced funding available for commercial banks and corporate debt issuers 
as a result  capital became more expensive and less available  however  the company does not foresee any difficulties meeting its cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months 
on december   the company entered into a five year multicurrency revolving credit agreement credit facility with a group of financial institutions under which it may borrow up to million under a selection of currencies and rate formulas 
this replaced the million credit agreement that was to expire in april management believes the financial institutions that are party to this arrangement have adequate capital and resources and will be able to fund future borrowings under the company s credit agreement 
the interest rate is based upon either  at the company s election  a defined base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus or minus applicable margins 
at november   the interest rate plus margin was 
commitment fees  letter of credit fees and other fees are payable as provided in the credit agreement 
as of year end  there was million outstanding on the million facility 
the credit facility includes a million letter of credit subline against which million in letters of credit had been issued as of year end the company had approximately million available for further borrowing at november  on january   the company entered into an interest rate agreement with a bank to manage its interest rate exposure on certain amounts outstanding under its million revolving credit agreement 
the interest rate agreement provides for the company to pay a fixed interest rate plus applicable margins and receive interest based on a three month libor on a notional amount of million and expires january  this will mitigate the company s economic interest rate risk until january the swap agreement has not been designated as a hedge pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
unrealized gains and losses and periodic settlement payments are recorded in interest expense in the statement of earnings and as a component of cash flows from operations in the statement of cash flows 
the fair value of the interest rate agreement at november  was million 
this was recorded as part of other long term liabilities 
the company did not have any derivative instruments at november  by using derivative instruments  the company exposes itself  from time to time  to credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes the company  which creates credit risk for the company 
the company minimizes this credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties which it believes have the financial resources to meet their obligations 
the company minimizes market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
the company s swap agreement incorporates by reference the non financial and financial debt covenants included in the company s credit facility 
the swap agreement also includes other events which would qualify as a default or termination event  whereby the counterparty could request payment on the derivative instrument 
cash and short term investments at year end were million compared to million at year end short term investments include tax exempt municipal money market funds 
cash and cash equivalents are held by financial institutions throughout the world 
management regularly reviews the credit worthiness of these institutions and maintains access to the company s funds 
the current ratio of at year end was lower than the current ratio of at year end primarily due to the peco acquisition 
long term debt of million at year end included a net million of borrowings during under the company s revolving credit agreement to fund a portion of the peco acquisition and stock repurchases and industrial revenue bonds of million 
required principal payments on long term debt will be approximately million in based on scheduled payments in current debt agreements 
the company was in compliance with all covenants related to its borrowings throughout and  as described in note g to the consolidated financial statements 
the ratio of total debt to total capitalization  defined as long term debt plus total shareholders equity  was at the end of compared to at fiscal year end the long term debt of million at year end related primarily to industrial revenue bonds 
the company had  shares of common stock outstanding as of fiscal year end compared to  shares outstanding at fiscal year end the main reason for the increase was the company s issuance of  shares of its common stock in partial consideration of the purchase of peco as discussed in note b in the consolidated financial statements partially offset by share repurchases 
shareholders equity increased to million from million at year end primarily as a result of net earnings  stock issuances related to the peco acquisition and stock option activity  and offset by stock repurchases of million  dividend payments of million  other comprehensive loss of million due to currency translation adjustments and an after tax adjustment of million to accumulated other comprehensive income related to the remeasurement of pension plan assets and obligations 
cash generated from operating activities decreased million to million for primarily due to higher investments in working capital compared to fiscal year the working capital fluctuations mainly resulted from the timing of payments made to vendors  the receipt of payments from customers  changes in inventory requirements and the timing of income tax payments 
however  the company did not experience a significant change in the number of days sales outstanding or inventory turns 
the working capital change also included million of cash used to purchase short term investments  whereas in  over million of cash was provided by the sale of short term investments 
cash flow from operating activities was million in and million in the million increase in from was primarily due to the sale of short term investments of million and decreases in inventories of million and income taxes of million 
for  cash flows used in investing activities of million were higher than the million recorded in primarily due to the acquisition of peco 
the company spent million on business acquisitions in compared to million in and million in additions to plant assets of million were primarily for the hvac filter manufacturing restructuring program  new product development programs  facility additions and improvements and cost reduction programs 
capital expenditures for normal facility maintenance and improvements  productivity improvements  safety initiatives  the hvac restructuring program  new products and filter media development are expected to be to million in capital spending included in this amount and related to the hvac restructuring program is estimated to be approximately million in the company has postponed several plant expansions and information technology projects until the us and world economies recover 
the company does expect to continue to invest aggressively in new product and media development  cost reduction projects and safety initiatives 
plant asset additions totaled million in and million in although a substantial amount of new equipment related to the hvac restructuring plan had been ordered in  it was not delivered as quickly as expected  causing capital spending to be lower than was anticipated 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  compared to cash used of million in and million in during  cash provided by net borrowings of million under the company s credit facility was partially offset by million used to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock and million used to redeem industrial revenue bonds 
the company spent million of cash to repurchase  shares of its common stock in and million to repurchase shares in dividend payments of million in increased from payments of million during the current annual dividend rate per share is compared to the previous annual rate of per share 
the company paid dividends of million in on june   the company s board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program of the company s common stock in the open market and through private transactions over a three year period 
this authorization replaced the company s previous million share repurchase authorization that expired on june  during  the company repurchased and retired  shares of common stock for million 
in and  respectively  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for million and  shares of common stock for million 
the number of issued shares was reduced as a result of the retirement of these shares 
at november   there was approximately million available for repurchase under the current authorization 
future repurchases of company stock may be made after considering cash flow requirements for internal growth including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  interest rates and the current market price of the company s stock 
clarcor believes that its current operations will continue to generate cash and that sufficient lines of credit remain available to fund current operating needs  pay dividends  invest in the development of new products and filter media  fund planned capital expenditures and expansion of current facilities  complete the hvac filter restructuring plans  provide for interest payments and required principal payments related to its debt agreements  fund pension plan contributions and repurchase company stock 
the company s strategy includes actively reviewing possible acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may affect operating cash flows and may require changes in the company s debt and capitalization 
in addition  capital market disruptions may affect the cost or availability of future borrowings 
the company has no material long term purchase commitments 
it is committed to restructure its hvac filter manufacturing operations 
although no significant purchase commitments were signed as of year end  approximately million of equipment related to the restructuring was on order 
the company enters into purchase obligations with suppliers on a short term basis in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes the company s current fixed cash obligations as of november  for the fiscal years indicated payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in millions long term debt excluding line of credit interest payable on long term debt excluding line of credit multicurrency line of credit interest payable on line of credit pension plan contributions investment in affiliate operating leases total interest payments on the company s variable rate debt are determined based on current interest rates as of year end the million outstanding as of november  under the company s five year revolving line of credit will be due by the end of the five year term 
annual interest payments related to the million will be approximately million for fiscal year based on the swap agreement entered into at the beginning of that expires in january after that  interest will be paid at a variable rate based on libor plus or minus applicable margins 
the amounts in the table above related to the line of credit assume a similar annual interest rate for the remaining term as that of the first two years and that no additional borrowings or payments will be made on the line of credit during the periods presented 
the minimum required contribution under the pension benefit guarantee corporation requirements for one of its us qualified pension plans for fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
the company  from time to time  makes contributions in excess of the minimum amount required as economic conditions warrant 
it has not determined whether it will make a voluntary contribution to its us qualified plans in  however  it does expect to contribute million to its non us qualified plan and million to its postretirement health care benefit plan to pay benefits during future estimates of the company s pension plan contributions may change significantly depending on the actual rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and regulatory requirements 
the company also has a nonqualified pension plan covering certain employees in the company s management 
the expected payments to be made under this plan are shown in the table above and are largely not funded 
as of november   the company s liability for uncertain income tax provisions reported in accordance with the company s adoption of the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  was million including interest 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  the company was unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements relate to various operating leases as discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had no variable interest entity or special purpose entity agreements during or other matters critical accounting estimates the company s critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation methods  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and postretirement benefits 
these critical accounting policies may be affected by recent relevant accounting pronouncements discussed in the following section 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these critical accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  the company believes the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
the following lists the most critical accounting estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements which require the company s management to use significant judgment and estimates of amounts that are inherently uncertain goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company periodically reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
these reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates of discount rates  terminal values  transaction multiples and future cash flows for the reporting units that may be impacted by future sales and operating results for the reporting units  market conditions and worldwide economic conditions 
all goodwill and intangibles are allocated to the reporting unit component at the time of acquisition 
the company has determined that the reporting unit components meet the criteria for aggregation into three reportable segments 
they are aggregated based on similar economic characteristics  nature of products and services  nature of production processes  type of customers and distribution methods 
in performing the impairment reviews  the company estimated the fair values of the aggregated reporting units using a present value method that discounted future cash flows 
for its indefinite lived intangibles  the company performed annual impairment tests using the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of its trademarks and trade names 
the company further analyzed various discount rates  transaction and capital market multiples and cash flows for aggregated reporting units to assess the reasonableness of its estimates and assumptions 
management believes its valuation technique and assumptions are reasonable for this purpose 
a sensitivity analysis was prepared which indicated that if these assumptions were individually changed by  there was no indication of impairment 
the company has not changed its methodology for valuing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
allowance for losses on accounts receivable allowances for losses on customer accounts receivable balances are estimated based on economic conditions in the industries to which the company sells and on historical experience by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss  fluctuations in amounts owed and current payment trends 
the company s concentration of risk is also monitored and at year end  the largest outstanding customer account balance was million and the five largest account balances totaled million 
the allowances provided are estimates that may be impacted by economic and market conditions which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and results of operations 
given the current economic conditions  the company is monitoring receivables and credit worthiness of its customers and managing its collection more closely 
pensions the company s pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rate used for each plan was based on the citigroup pension discount curve 
the projected benefit payments in each year were discounted using the appropriate spot rate from the curve 
for each plan  a single discount rate was determined that produced the same total discounted value 
that rate  rounded to basis points  was the discount rate selected for the plan 
the discount rate used for the qualified plans for us employees was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the qualified plan 
the mortality table for the qualified plans is determined based on the actuarial table that is most reflective of participation rates and mortality of the plan participants 
the mortality table adopted rp projected was developed for pension plans by a society of actuaries study 
the mortality table used for the nonqualified pension plan is specified by the plan agreement 
the assumptions are similarly determined for each pension obligation 
actual results and future obligations will vary based on changes in interest rates  stock and bond market valuations and employee compensation 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would result in additional expense in fiscal of approximately million  while a reduction in the discount rate of would result in additional expense of approximately million for the company s qualified defined benefit pension plans for us covered employees 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million at year end is due primarily to prior changes in assumptions related to discount rates and expected compared to actual asset returns 
this actuarial loss will be recognized as pension expense in the future over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plans in accordance with sfas no 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company is required to estimate and record income taxes payable for each of the us and international jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal  state and international tax transactions for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved

 earnings per share 
fsp eitf is effective for the company s fiscal year and requires the restatement of all previously reported earnings per share data

recent market events current market conditions and economic events have significantly impacted the financial condition  liquidity and outlook for a wide range of companies  including many companies outside the financial services sectors 
the company has considered the potential impact of such conditions and events as it relates to currently reported financial results of operations and liquidity  including consideration of the possible impact of other than temporary impairment  counterparty credit risk and hedge accounting 
the company does not believe that current market conditions and economic events have significantly impacted its results of operations or current liquidity  nor does the company believe that  based on its current investment policies and contractual relationships  it is subject to greater risk from such factors than other companies of similar size and market breadth 
outlook the company anticipates a slow first quarter of with sales and operating profit lower than that of the first quarter of fiscal in each of its segments 
assuming that the us and world economies do not suffer a severe recession through the entire year  it does expect sales growth  margin improvement and higher diluted earnings per share in fiscal diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of to in the company began manufacturing protura tm nanofiber embedded media late in the third quarter of the development of this technology is expected to provide additional sales and cost reduction opportunities for the company s filter product lines overall as it has done initially for dust collector cartridge production 
new product introductions should also contribute to future growth 
the company s diversification into many different  though complementary  filtration lines has resulted in an operation with increasingly stable sales and profits on a company wide basis 
the company is focused on the filtration aftermarket which provides a strong base of recurring revenues 
the company believes it has a strong balance sheet  strong and consistent cash flows and available access to cash resources and credit as needed 
nevertheless  a continuation of the current domestic and international economic conditions will certainly impact the company s outlook 
fiscal was a very unusual year for raw material costs 
there were significant increases in various types and grades of steel and metals  oil and natural gas  resins  adhesives  gaskets  packaging material and filter media prices during the first three quarters of the year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  hydrocarbon and most metals prices declined significantly 
though these declines did not materially impact the company s input costs in the fourth quarter  the company expects to see these declines reflected in its cost structure throughout in addition  the company has implemented a very aggressive cost reduction program to further contain manufacturing overhead and administrative costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is primarily related to the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  the company may also be exposed to various market risks that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business related to items such as the cost of raw materials and changes in inflation 
certain contractual relationships with customers and vendors mitigate risks from changes in raw material costs and currency exchange rate changes that arise from normal purchasing and normal sales activities 
interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to its financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash and certain short term  highly liquid investments considered to be cash equivalents 
interest rate fluctuations could affect earnings  cash flows or the fair value of the company s financial liabilities 
the company s debt obligations are primarily at variable rates and are denominated in us dollars 
in order to minimize the long term costs of borrowing  the company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring trends in rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements and the duration of such agreements 
the company mitigated its interest rate risk on its million of borrowing under its revolving line of credit by entering into a fixed interest rate swap agreement at the beginning of which fixed its interest until january therefore  of its total debt outstanding at year end  less than million is subject to variable interest rates 
interest rate risk is not expected to be significant to the company in fiscal  and as a result  it is anticipated that a change in rates would not have a material impact on the company s net earnings  cash flows or fair value of its debt in fiscal foreign currency since the company operates through subsidiaries in several countries around the world  its reported financial results of operations  including the reported value of assets and liabilities  are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the us are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period 
earnings and cash flow statements are translated at weighted average rates of exchange 
although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact  the translation changes may impact the overall value of net assets 
the company is also exposed to transaction risk from changes in foreign currency rates through sales and purchasing transactions when it sells product in functional currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred 
the functional currencies of its worldwide facilities primarily include the us dollar  the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  the chinese yuan renminbi and the mexican peso 
as these currencies fluctuate against each other  and other currencies  the company is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk on sales and purchasing transactions 
currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the us dollar while another currency weakens 
because of the complex interrelationship of the worldwide supply chains and distribution channels  it is difficult to quantify the impact of a particular change in exchange rates 
however  the company estimates that if the us dollar strengthened or weakened relative to the currencies where the company s foreign income and cash flows are derived  the effect on the consolidated results of operations could be to per diluted share 
the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates was not material to the company s financial condition and results of operations in fiscal as a result of continued foreign sales and business activities  the company continues to evaluate derivative financial instruments  including forwards  swaps and purchased options  to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes in the future 
the company did not hold any such derivatives during  or related to foreign currency exchange
