item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 
market risk the primary objective of wesbanco s asset liability committee alco is to maximize net interest income within established policy parameters 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet composition  market risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions and liquidity risk 
market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
management considers interest rate risk wesbanco s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
the relative consistency of wesbanco s net interest income is largely dependent on effective management of interest rate risk 
as interest rates change in the market  rates earned on interest rate sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently 
differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities  or because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and or the percentage of rate changes 
wesbanco s alco  comprised of senior management from various functional areas  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of an earnings simulation model 
the model is highly dependent on various assumptions  which change regularly as the balance sheet and market interest rates change 
the key assumptions and strategies employed are analyzed bi monthly and reviewed and documented by the alco 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income resulting from the effect of changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the earnings simulation model  although it has been subjected to periodic independent reviews and improvements have been made as a result of various recommendations made by these outside reviewers as well as our primary federal regulators during their regular annual exams 
modeling changes in net interest income requires making certain assumptions regarding prepayment rates  callable bonds  and adjustments to non time deposit interest rates which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
prepayment assumptions and adjustments to non time deposit rates at varying levels of interest rates are based primarily on historical experience and current market rates 
security portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments and callable bond forecasts are adjusted at varying levels of interest rates 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates  callable bond forecasts and non time deposit rate changes will approximate actual future results 
moreover  the net interest income sensitivity chart presented in table  net interest income sensitivity  assumes the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve  regardless of the duration of the maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
since the assumptions used in the model relative to changes in interest rates are uncertain  the simulation analysis should not be relied upon as being indicative of actual results 
the analysis may not consider all actions that wesbanco would employ in response to changes in interest rates and various earning asset and costing liability balances 
management is aware of the significant effect inflation deflation has upon interest rates and ultimately upon financial performance 
wesbanco s ability to cope with inflation deflation is best determined by analyzing its capability to respond to changing market interest rates  as well as its ability to manage the various elements of noninterest income and expense during periods of increasing or decreasing inflation deflation 
wesbanco monitors the level and mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities through alco in order to reduce the impact of inflation deflation on net interest income 
management also controls the effects of inflation deflation 
table of contents by conducting periodic reviews of the prices and terms of its various products and services  both in terms of the costs to offer the services as well as outside market influences upon such pricing  by introducing new products and services or deleting or reducing the availability of existing products and services  and by controlling overhead expenses 
interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month period assuming an immediate and sustained and basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates as compared to a stable rate environment or base model 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to a reduction of and or less  respectively  of net interest income from the base model over a twelve month period 
table  net interest income sensitivity  shows wesbanco s interest rate sensitivity at december  and december  assuming both a and basis point interest rate change  compared to a base model  except that due to current low interest rates  the basis point decreasing change is shown as not applicable for  and instead a basis point rising rate environment is shown 
table net interest income sensitivity immediate change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income from base over one year alco guidelines december  december  n a n a throughout most of the first two thirds of  the yield curve was relatively flat or somewhat inverted  particularly between short term funding rates and longer term rates for investments and loans  causing many banks to experience lower net interest margins  including wesbanco 
in mid third quarter  rate expectations began to change to a lower interest rate environment  due to market conditions and liquidity concerns in the sub prime and collateralized debt instrument markets 
for the remainder of  the federal reserve bank provided liquidity to the markets and lowered the benchmark federal funds rate charged between banks as well as the discount rate charged to banks  resulting in these rates ending at and  respectively  from and before the rate cuts 
rates continued to drop throughout  ending the year at a range of to for federal funds and for the discount rate  and they are expected by economists to remain substantially at these levels for most  if not all of due to the current severe global recession 
central banks worldwide  including the federal reserve bank  have infused liquidity into banks and markets in general with a series of coordinated responses meant to mitigate the impact of the severe recession and overall lack of liquidity for many asset types in the various markets 
a widening of the curve between short and longer term interest rates occurred for much of  and due to wesbanco s prior liability sensitive balance sheet  the bank experienced a widening of its net interest margin throughout most of the year  as lower overall funding costs more than offset lower loan and investment rates 
the earnings simulation model currently projects that net interest income for the next twelve month period would decrease by if interest rates were to fall immediately by basis points  compared to an increase of  for the same scenario as of december  while a basis point falling interest rate scenario is unrealistic in the present interest rate environment  and is thus not shown above due to the targeted federal funds rate being at an all time low of a range of to  a decrease of basis points in certain sectors of the interest rate curve is possible and is shown above despite the historic low levels of us treasury rates 
given the current rate environment  and the expectation of continued compression in earning asset rates as prepayments and maturities occur and new investment and lending opportunities replace such cash flows  the alco does not anticipate the bank s ability to lower deposit and other funding rates at the same pace 
this is primarily due to natural interest rate floors on certain deposit types  competition throughout our markets from small and large 
table of contents banks and thrifts  and higher than historical spreads on certain borrowing types due to market liquidity issues and the late global financial crisis 
net interest income would increase by and decrease by and if rates increased by  and  basis points respectively  as compared to minus  minus and minus at december  for the same categories with this non linear result caused by an anticipation of slowing prepayment speeds and the extension risk associated with certain asset types  primarily residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities  in a basis point rising rate environment 
nonetheless  there has been a significant improvement during in the bank s prior liability sensitive position 
mortgage instruments  both loans and securities  generally exhibit a propensity to prepay at faster speeds during periods of decreasing rates  and at slower speeds when rates increase  due to the customer s contractual ability to prepay principal without penalty by refinancing particularly when rates are falling 
the decrease in liability sensitivity between december  and december  was a result of changes in balance sheet composition primarily as short term borrowings were lengthened through the fhlb  as well as reductions in mmdas and certain cd maturities due to customer preferences and the overall lower interest rate environment 
the continued reduction in fixed rate  longer term residential mortgages  as the bank sells most of its current fixed rate production into the secondary market  has also benefited the asset liability position 
these changes favorably impacted wesbanco s prior sensitivity to rising interest rates 
the bank has significant additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of pittsburgh  and may continue  as appropriate  to utilize this funding source to mitigate the impact on our balance sheet of embedded options in commercial and residential loans and to lengthen liabilities to help offset mismatches in various asset maturities  as an alternative to the immediate rate shock analysis  the alco monitors interest rate risk by ramping or increasing interest rates basis points gradually over a twelve month period 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period 
management believes that the ramping analysis reflects a more realistic movement of interest rates  whereas the immediate rate shock reflects a less likely scenario 
the simulation model at december  using the basis point increasing rate ramp analysis projects that net interest income would increase over the next twelve months  compared to a decrease at december  wesbanco also periodically measures the economic value of equity  which is defined as the market value of equity in various increasing and decreasing rate scenarios 
at december   the market value of equity as a percent of base in a basis point rising rate environment would increase  and in a basis point falling rate environment it would decrease  as compared to decreases of and  respectively  for the same increasing and decreasing rate environments as of december  wesbanco s policy is to limit such change to minus for a basis point change in interest rates 
wesbanco s alco evaluates various strategies to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
these strategies for most of emphasized reducing liability sensitivity due to an out of policy guideline percentage relative to the basis point rising rate scenario at year end  as well as expectations of rising market interest rates  until more recently when market forecasts  reflecting the current ongoing recessionary environment  changed to a primarily flat interest rate environment for much of the year 
as a result  the balance sheet s liability sensitivity to rising rates has been substantially eliminated at year end  with current projections of an asset sensitive position in an initial basis point rising rate environment 
among the strategies that are evaluated by the committee are utilizing derivative instruments to protect against changes in interest rates and their impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities or upon cash flows  although no such derivatives are currently outstanding 
the bank also looks to periodically extend borrowing terms with the fhlb and other parties and structure new repurchase agreements with terms providing some protection for future rate increases 
if reinvestment rates and or asset spreads are deemed unfavorable for new investments  investment proceeds are applied to the pay down of short term borrowings or are utilized to fund 
table of contents new loan commitments 
another strategy that is currently being executed is decreasing the level of wesbanco s fixed rate residential real estate loans maintained in the loan portfolio  by allowing existing maturities to run off without replacement and selling most newly originated fixed rate loans into the secondary market under rate lock commitments  which are struck with third party buyers in order to limit rate risk between customer commitment and loan funding and sale into the secondary market 
other strategies include remixing the loan portfolio as cash flows from residential mortgages are received into shorter lived  and typically higher yielding commercial loans  offering special maturity  competitively priced term certificates of deposit to offset runoff in other certificate categories and in money market deposit accounts  and in certain markets  regionally pricing certain deposit types to increase sales volume where competition is stronger and our market share is lower 
the bank also is continuing a strategy of focusing its marketing efforts on the generation or retention of low cost and non interest bearing transaction accounts  and more recently utilizing the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program as a replacement for non renewed cds or as an alternative to current higher costing wholesale borrowing sources including fhlb advances 
the potential use of interest rate swap agreements to provide certain commercial loan commitments of a longer term nature is also an available resource to meet customer demands and hedge interest rate risk  although at this time  no such customer commitments have been generated
