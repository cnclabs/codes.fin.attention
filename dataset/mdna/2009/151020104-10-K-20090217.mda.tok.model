item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we note these factors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  we disclaim and do not undertake any obligations to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements in this report  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in assumptions  or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosure we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k filed with or furnished to the sec 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully 
any of the factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business  prospects  financial condition  operating results or credit ratings  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or risks that we currently consider immaterial  could also negatively affect our business and operations 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
we have historically experienced  and may continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  and may result in volatility of our stock price 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our products  pricing decisions  and those of our competitors  including decisions to increase or decrease prices  regulatory approvals for our products  timing and levels of spending for research and development  sales and marketing  timing and levels of reimbursement from third party payors for our products  timing and market acceptance of new product introductions by us and or competitors  development or expansion of business infrastructure in new clinical and geographic markets  acquisition of new products and companies  tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate  timing and recognition of certain research and development milestones and license fees  ability to control our costs  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and economic and market instability 
during the next several years  we will be very dependent on the continued commercial success of our primary products revlimid  thalomid and vidaza 
during the next several years  the growth of our business will be largely dependent on the commercial success of revlimid and our other products 
revlimid was approved by the fda  the ec  the swissmedic  the tga  and in october by health canada for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy 
in addition  revlimid was approved by the fda and the canadian therapeutic products directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk mds  associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities 
we cannot predict whether revlimid will continue to gain the acceptance of regulators  physicians  patients and other key opinion leaders as a relatively safe and effective drug that has certain advantages as compared to existing or future therapies 
we are also seeking to introduce revlimid in additional international markets as well as obtaining approvals for additional indications both in the united states and internationally 
a delay in gaining the requisite regulatory approvals could negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our common stock 

table of contents thalomid was approved by the fda for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and is also approved for the treatment and suppression of cutaneous manifestations of enl  an inflammatory complication of leprosy 
in april  the tga approved a supplemental filing granting thalomid marketing approval for use in combination with melphalan and prednisone for patients with untreated multiple myeloma or ineligible for high dose chemotherapy and also granted thalomid marketing approval in combination with dexamethasone for induction therapy prior to high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue  for the treatment of patients with untreated multiple myeloma 
in addition  in april  thalomid was granted full marketing authorization by the ec for use in combination with melphalan and prednisone as a treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
if unexpected adverse experiences are reported in connection with the use of thalomid by patients  physician and patient comfort with the product could be undermined  the commercial success of thalomid could be affected and the acceptance of our other products  including revlimid  may be adversely impacted 
vidaza has been shown to reverse the effects of dna hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re expression 
vidaza was licensed from pharmacia upjohn  now part of pfizer  and was approved by the fda for the treatment of all subtypes of mds 
additionally  vidaza was granted orphan drug designation by the fda for the treatment of aml 
in december  vidaza was granted full marketing authorization by the ec for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with intermediate and high risk mds according to the ipss or cmml with percent marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder  or aml with percent blasts and multi lineage dysplasia  according to who classification 
our revenues and profits would be negatively impacted if adverse experiences were reported in connection with any of these three products or generic versions were to be approved and launched 
see we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and our products may be subject to generic competition for further discussion related to possible generic competition for thalomid 
sales of our products are dependent on third party reimbursement 
sales of our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance  managed care  pharmacy benefit and similar health care management organizations  or reimbursed by government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other third party payors 
these health care management organizations and third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
additionally  the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments  and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort 
the us government  state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs  including price controls  restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products 
adoption of price controls and cost containment measures in new jurisdictions or programs  and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures  could further limit our net revenue and results 
if these organizations and third party payors do not consider our products to be cost effective compared to other available therapies  they may not reimburse providers or consumers of our products or  if they do  the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis 

table of contents if we are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing our products  our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected which could have a negative impact on the value of our securities 
many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid stages of research and development and will require the commitment of substantial financial resources  extensive research  development  preclinical testing  clinical trials  manufacturing scale up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale 
moreover  our commercially available products may require additional studies with respect to approved indications as well as new indications pending approval 
if it becomes too expensive to sustain our present commitment of resources on a long term basis  we will be unable to continue certain necessary research and development activities 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that our clinical testing will render satisfactory results  or that we will receive required regulatory approvals for our new products or new indications 
if any of our products  even if developed and approved  cannot be successfully commercialized  our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected which could have a negative impact on the value of our common stock 
if our products are not accepted by the market  demand for our products will deteriorate or not materialize at all 
it is necessary that revlimid  thalomid  vidaza  focalin and focalin xr  and the ritalin family of drugs achieve and maintain market acceptance 
a number of factors may adversely impact the degree of market acceptance of our products  including the products efficacy  safety and advantages  if any  over competing products  as well as the reimbursement policies of third party payors  such as government and private insurance plans 
in particular  thalidomide  when used by pregnant women  has resulted in serious birth defects  and the negative history associated with thalidomide and birth defects may decrease the market acceptance of thalomid 
in addition  the stem cell products that we are developing through our celgene cellular therapeutics subsidiary may represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional products and therapies which are now  or may be in the future  manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies 
furthermore  public attitudes may be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe  and stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community 
if our products are not accepted by the market  demand for our products will deteriorate or not materialize at all 
the pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive government regulation which presents numerous risks to us 
the discovery  preclinical development  clinical trials  manufacturing  restricted distribution systems such as our steps and revassist programs  marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and biologics are all subject to extensive regulation  including  without limitation  the us federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the us public health service act  the us foreign corrupt practices act and other federal and state statutes  including anti kickback  antitrust and false claims laws  as well as similar laws in foreign jurisdictions 
if we or our contractors and collaborators are delayed in receiving  or are unable to obtain at all  necessary governmental approvals  we will be unable to effectively market our products 
the testing  marketing and manufacturing of our products require regulatory approval  including approval from the fda and  in some cases  from the environmental protection agency  or epa  or governmental authorities outside of the united states that perform roles similar to those of the fda and epa  including the ec  the swissmedic  the tga and health canada 
certain of our pharmaceutical products  such as focalin  fall under the controlled substances act of that requires authorization by the us drug enforcement agency  or dea  of the us department of justice in order to handle and distribute these products 

table of contents the regulatory approval process presents several risks to us in general  preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years  and require the expenditure of substantial resources  and the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval  delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or other data to demonstrate compliance with  or upon the failure of the product to meet  a regulatory agency s requirements for safety  efficacy and quality or  in the case of a product seeking an orphan drug indication  because another designee received approval first or receives approval of other labeled indications  requirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy  or the adoption of new regulations or legislation  the scope of any regulatory approval  when obtained  may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and reimbursed and may impose significant limitations in the nature of warnings  precautions and contra indications that could materially affect the sales and profitability of the drug  pricing and reimbursement controls and policies may become more stringent both inside and outside the united states which could affect the sales and profitability of our drugs  approved products  as well as their manufacturers  are subject to continuing and ongoing review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with these products or the failure to adhere to manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on their manufacture  sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market  regulatory authorities and agencies of the united states or foreign governments may promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products  guidelines and recommendations published by various non governmental organizations can reduce the use of our products  once a product receives marketing approval  we may not market that product for broader or different applications  and the fda may not grant us approval with respect to separate product applications that represent extensions of our basic technology 
in addition  the fda may withdraw or modify existing approvals in a significant manner or promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products 
the fda may also request that we perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our existing or proposed products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market  products  such as revlimid  that are subject to accelerated approval can be subject to an expedited withdrawal if the post marketing study commitments are not completed with due diligence  the post marketing restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be inadequate to assure the safe use of the drug  or evidence demonstrates that the drug is not shown to be safe and effective under its conditions of use 
additionally  promotional materials for such products are subject to enhanced surveillance  including pre approval review of all promotional materials used within days following marketing approval and a requirement for the submissions days prior to initial dissemination of all promotional materials disseminated after days following marketing approval  and 
table of contents our labeling and promotional activities relating to our products as well as our post marketing activities are regulated by the fda  the federal trade commission  the united states department of justice  the dea  state regulatory agencies and foreign regulatory agencies and are subject to associated risks 
in addition  individual states  acting through their attorneys general  have become active as well  seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 
if we fail to comply with regulations regarding the promotion and sale of our products  such as prohibiting promotion of off label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained  such agencies could bring an enforcement action against us that could inhibit our marketing capabilities as well as result in significant penalties 
we recently sent a letter to doctors warning that a study of the drug innohep to treat dangerous blood clots suggests that the drug may increase the risk of death in elderly patients 
the fda has posted the letter on its website  which recommends that doctors consider alternatives to innohep in patients with deep vein thrombosis  life threatening blood clots in major veins such as in the legs 
as a result  the fda has requested that we revise the package insert to reference the suggested study results relating to innohep 
innohep was being marketed by pharmion at the time we acquired the company on march  since our acquisition of pharmion  all innohep sales are included in other product sales since we consider innohep to be non core 
the fda approval process would allow for the approval of an anda or b application for a generic version of our approved products upon the expiration  through passage of time or successful legal challenge  of relevant patent or non patent exclusivity protection 
andas and b applications are generally less burdensome than full ndas in that  in lieu of clinical data  these applications rely in whole  or in part  upon the safety and efficacy findings of the referenced approved product in conjunction with bridging data  typically bioequivalence data 
the fda s center for biologics evaluation and research currently regulates under cfr parts and human tissue or cells intended for transplantation  implantation  infusion or transfer to a human recipient 
part requires tissue establishments to screen and test donors  to prepare and follow written procedures for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease and to register the establishment with fda 
it also provides for inspection by the fda of tissue establishments 
currently  we are required to be  and are  licensed to operate in new york  new jersey  maryland and california  four of the states in which we currently collect placentas and umbilical cord blood for our allogeneic and private stem cell banking businesses 
if other states adopt similar licensing requirements  we would need to obtain such licenses to continue operating 
if we are delayed in receiving  or are unable to obtain at all  necessary licenses  we will be unable to provide services in those states and this would impact negatively on our revenues 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and our products may be subject to generic competition 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents  protect trade secrets  obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical firms  including ours  can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions including those related to our restricted distribution systems such as our steps and revassist programs 

table of contents under the current us patent laws  patent applications filed in the united states on or before november  are maintained in secrecy until patents issue 
patent applications filed in the us on or after november  are not published until approximately months after their earliest claimed priority date  and publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries 
thus  we may discover sometime in the future that we  or the third parties from whom we have licensed patents or patent applications  were not the first to make and or file the inventions covered by the patents and patent applications in which we have or seek rights 
in the event that a third party has also filed a patent application for any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications  or those we have licensed in  we could become involved in an interference proceeding declared by the pto  to determine priority of invention or an opposition proceeding in other places such as europe 
such an interference or opposition could result in the loss of an issued us or foreign patent  respectively  or loss of any opportunity to secure us patent protection for that invention 
even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us  such proceedings could result in substantial cost and delay to us and limit the scope of the claimed subject matter 
in addition  the coverage sought in a patent application may not be obtained or may be significantly reduced before the patent is issued 
consequently  if our pending applications  or pending applications that we have licensed in from third parties  do not result in the issuance of patents or if any patents that are issued do not provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage  our ability to sustain the necessary level of intellectual property rights upon which our success depends may be restricted 
moreover  different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents  and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others 
therefore  if the issuance to us or our licensors  in a given country  of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention  or if any judicial interpretation of the validity  enforceability or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country  our ability to protect our intellectual property in other countries may be limited 
furthermore  even if our patent applications  or those we have licensed in  are issued  our competitors may still challenge the scope  validity or enforceability of such patents in court  requiring us to engage in complex  lengthy and costly litigation 
alternatively  our competitors may be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology 
if any of our issued or licensed patents are infringed  we may not be successful in enforcing our or our licensor s intellectual property rights or defending the validity or enforceability of our issued patents and subsequently not be able to develop or market applicable product exclusively 
we rely upon unpatented proprietary and trade secret technology that we try to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners  employees  consultants  outside scientific collaborators  sponsored researchers and other advisors 
if these agreements are breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
despite precautions taken by us  others may obtain access to or independently develop our proprietary technology or such technology may be found to be non proprietary or not a trade secret 
our right to practice the inventions claimed in certain patents that relate to thalomid arises under licenses granted to us by others  including the rockefeller university  entremed and cmcc 
in addition to these patents  which relate to thalidomide  we have also licensed from cmcc certain patents relating to thalidomide analogs 
in december  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with cmcc and entremed inc pursuant to which cmcc exclusively licensed to us certain patents and patent applications that relate to analogs  metabolites  precursors and hydrolysis products of thalidomide  and all stereoisomers thereof 
our license under the december agreement is worldwide and royalty bearing  and we have complete control over the prosecution of the licensed thalidomide analog patent rights 
under this december agreement  we are obligated to comply with certain milestones for a revlimid approval and royalties with respect to sales of revlimid 
the december agreement also grants us an option for a certain time period to inventions in the field of thalidomide analogs that may be developed at cmcc in the laboratory of dr 
robert d amato  pursuant to the terms and conditions of a separate sponsored research agreement negotiated between cmcc and us 

table of contents further  while we believe these confidentiality agreements and license agreements to be valid and enforceable  our rights under these agreements may not continue or disputes concerning these agreements may arise 
if any of the foregoing should occur  we may be unable to rely upon our unpatented proprietary and trade secret technology  or we may be unable to use the third party proprietary technology we have licensed in  either of which may prevent or hamper us from successfully pursuing our business 
it is also possible that third party patent applications and patents could issue with claims that broadly cover certain aspects of our business or of the subject matter claimed in the patents or patent applications owned or optioned by us or licensed to us  which may limit our ability to conduct our business or to practice under our patents  and may impede our efforts to obtain meaningful patent protection of our own 
if patents are issued to third parties that contain competitive or conflicting claims  we may be legally prohibited from pursuing research  development or commercialization of potential products or be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
we may be legally prohibited from using patented technology  may not be able to obtain any license to the patents and technologies of third parties on acceptable terms  if at all  or may not be able to obtain or develop alternative technologies 
consequently  if we cannot successfully defend against any patent infringement suit that may be brought against us by a third party  we may lose the ability to continue to conduct our business as we presently do  or to practice certain subject matter delineated by patent claims that we have exclusive rights to  whether by ownership or by license  and that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
under the hatch waxman amendments to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  products covered by approved ndas or supplemental ndas may be protected by periods of patent and or non patent exclusivity 
during the exclusivity periods  the fda is generally prevented from granting effective approval of an anda 
upon the expiration of the applicable exclusivities  through passage of time or successful legal challenge  the fda may grant effective approval of an anda for a generic drug  or may accept reference to a previously protected nda in a b application 
depending upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities  any such approval could be limited to certain formulations and or indications claims  ie  those not covered by any outstanding exclusivities 
we rely upon trademarks and service marks to protect our rights to the intellectual property used in our business 
we have grown rapidly  and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted 
we have an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial and increasing investments in research and development  sales and marketing  and facilities 
we plan to continue to grow and our plan of growth contains various risks  some of which we cannot control 
for example we will need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses including clinical trial costs  expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of our products  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control  we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and faster growing multinational organization  and we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing  marketing and distribution capacity  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control 

table of contents if the third parties upon whom we rely fail to produce on a timely basis the api  encapsulation  finishing and packaging services in the volumes that we require or fail to meet quality standards and maintain necessary licensure from regulatory authorities  we may be unable to meet demand for our products  potentially resulting in lost revenues 
we have contracted with third party manufacturers to provide api  encapsulation  finishing services and packaging to meet our needs 
we intend to continue to utilize third parties as needed to produce certain of our products on a commercial scale 
the api for thalomid is manufactured in our zofingen  switzerland  manufacturing facility 
we have a contract manufacturing agreement with aptuit inc uk as a secondary api supplier 
with regard to drug product manufacturing  we have contract manufacturing relationships with penn pharmaceuticals services limited and institute of drug technology australia limited  for the formulation and encapsulation of the finished dosage form of thalomid capsules 
sharp corporation performs the packaging of the final product 
the api for revlimid is manufactured in our zofingen  switzerland  manufacturing facility 
we have a contract manufacturing agreement with aptuit inc uk as a secondary api supplier 
with regard to drug product manufacturing  we perform the formulation and encapsulation of the finished dosage form of revlimid capsules in our boudry  switzerland manufacturing facility 
we have a contract manufacturing relationship with penn pharmaceuticals services limited as a secondary supplier 
our boudry  switzerland facility performs the packaging of final product 
in addition  sharp corporation and cimex ag perform packaging of the final product 
the api for vidaza is supplied by ash stevens  inc we have a contract manufacturing agreement with baxter gmbh and ben venue laboratories  inc for the packaging  formulation and filling the product into vials 
the api for focalin is currently obtained from two suppliers  johnson matthey inc and siegfried usa  inc  and we rely on a single manufacturer  mikart  inc  for the tableting and packaging of focalin finished product 
the api for focalin xr is supplied by both siegfried and johnson matthey inc on behalf of novartis for the manufacture of focalin xr 
in all the countries where we sell our products  governmental regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing  packaging  labeling and storing 
all of our suppliers of raw materials and contract manufacturers must comply with these regulations 
failure to do so could result in supply interruptions 
in the united states  the fda requires that all suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk material and all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the united states achieve and maintain compliance with the fda s cgmp regulations and guidelines 
failure of our third party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on them or us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  disgorgement  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products 
in addition  before any product batch produced by our manufacturers can be shipped  it must conform to release specifications pre approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical product 
if the operations of one or more of our manufacturers were to become unavailable for any reason  any required fda review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products 
if our outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for quality  quantity or timeliness  or do not achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulations  demand for our products or our ability to continue supplying such products could substantially decline 

table of contents we utilize third parties for the distribution of our products in the us we have contracted with ivers lee corporation  d b a sharp  a specialty distributor  to distribute thalomid and revlimid in the united states 
if sharp does not perform its obligations  our ability to distribute thalomid and revlimid in the united states may be impacted for a limited period of time 
we have contracted with cardinal health sps  a specialty distributor  to distribute vidaza in the united states 
if cardinal health sps does not perform its obligations  our ability to distribute vidaza in the united states may be impacted for a limited period of time 
if our distributors fail to perform and we cannot secure a replacement distributor within a reasonable period of time  we may experience adverse effects to our business and results of operations 
we are continuing to establish foreign marketing and distribution capabilities 
we are continuing to establish marketing and distribution capabilities in international markets with respect to our products 
at the same time  we are in the process of obtaining necessary governmental and regulatory approvals to sell our products in certain countries 
if we have not successfully completed and implemented adequate marketing and distribution support services upon our receipt of such approvals  our ability to effectively launch our products in these countries would be severely restricted 
certain risks related to the commercial success of vidaza may present significant challenges to us 
risks related to the commercial success and future growth of vidaza are summarized as follows our ability to achieve additional marketing authorizations for vidaza  continued acceptance by regulators  physicians  patients and other key decision makers as a safe  superior therapeutic as compared to currently existing or future treatments for mds  and our ability to successfully compete with other approved mds therapies 
the integration of entities we acquire may present significant challenges to us 
achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of entities will depend in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner 
our integration of these entities involves a number of risks  including  but not limited to demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition  the diversion of management s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations  higher integration costs than anticipated  failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings  difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees  
table of contents difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices  as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations  and difficulties in the integration of departments  systems  including accounting systems  technologies  books and records  and procedures  as well as in maintaining uniform standards  controls including internal control over financial reporting required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related procedures and policies 
if we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses  we may experience material negative consequences to our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may be unable to retain skilled personnel and maintain key relationships 
the success of our business depends  in large part  on our continued ability to i attract and retain highly qualified management  scientific  manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel  ii successfully integrate large numbers of new employees into our corporate culture and iii develop and maintain important relationships with leading research and medical institutions and key distributors 
competition for these types of personnel and relationships is intense 
among other benefits  we use stock options to attract and retain personnel 
stock option accounting rules require us to recognize all stock based compensation costs as expenses 
these or other factors could reduce the number of shares management and our board of directors grants under our stock option plans 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract or retain skilled personnel or maintain key relationships  including key employees of pharmion  or that the costs of retaining such personnel or maintaining such relationships will not materially increase 
the hazardous materials we use in our research  development and other business operations could result in significant liabilities  which could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources 
we use certain hazardous materials in our research  development and general business activities 
while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with the federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use of these materials  we cannot be certain that accidental injury or contamination will not occur 
any such accident or contamination could result in substantial liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources 
additionally  the cost of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in the future  requiring us to expend more financial resources either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance coverage 
litigation on a variety of matters may subject us to significant legal expenses and liability 
from time to time  we may be subject to litigation on a variety of matters  including intellectual property  licensing arrangements with other persons and product liability 
litigation requires the expenditure of significant time and resources  and is inherently unpredictable 
if any litigation were to have an unanticipated adverse result  there could be a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
see also legal proceedings contained in part i  item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents the pharmaceutical and biotech industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
the pharmaceutical and biotech industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms  including but not limited to amgen  which potentially competes with our tnf a and kinase inhibitors  astrazeneca plc  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our imids compounds and tnf a inhibitors  biogen idec inc and genzyme corporation  both of which are generally developing drugs that address the oncology and immunology markets  bristol myers squibb co  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our imids compounds and tnf a inhibitors  eisai co  ltd  supergen  inc and johnson johnson compete or may potentially compete with vidaza  genentech  inc  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our imids compounds and tnf a inhibitors  johnson johnson  which potentially competes with certain of our proprietary programs including our oral anti inflammatory programs  novartis  which potentially competes with our imids compounds and kinase programs  pfizer  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our kinase inhibitors  and takeda and johnson johnson  which compete with revlimid and thalomid in the treatment of multiple myeloma and in clinical trials with our imids compounds 
many of these companies have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
we also experience competition from universities and other research institutions  and in some instances  we compete with others in acquiring technology from these sources 
the pharmaceutical industry has undergone  and is expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change  and we expect competition to intensify as technical advances in the field are made and become more widely known 
the development of products  including generics  or processes by our competitors with significant advantages over those that we are seeking to develop could cause the marketability of our products to stagnate or decline 
changes in our effective income tax rate could impact our earnings 
various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  the accounting for stock options and other share based payments  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of research and development spending  changes in accounting standards  future levels of capital expenditures  changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  the outcome of examinations by the irs and other jurisdictions  the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits and changes in overall levels of pre tax earnings 
the impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have an impact on our results of operations 

table of contents our operations may be impacted by currency fluctuations that may cause our earnings to fluctuate 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk  but not to engage in currency speculation 
we use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions and balance sheet exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we use derivative instruments  including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction  to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates but not eliminate our anticipated exposure to currency fluctuations 
the use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost 
any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations within a short period of time could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet our financial reporting obligations 
as we continue to expand at a rapid pace  the development of new and or improved automated systems will remain an ongoing priority 
during this expansion period  our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting 
such misstatements may result in litigation and or negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our common stock 
the current global credit and financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business 
sales of our products are dependent  in large part  on reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers  distribution partners and other organizations 
as a result of the current global credit and financial market conditions  these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment 
in addition  federal and state health authorities may reduce medicare and medicaid reimbursements  and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims 
a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our product sales and revenue 
due to the recent tightening of global credit  there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators 
we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business  including portions of our product manufacturing  royalty revenue  clinical development of future collaboration products  conduct of clinical trials and raw materials 
if such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may make it difficult for you to sell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive 
the market for our shares of common stock may be subject to disruptions that could cause volatility in their prices 
in general  the current global economic crisis has caused substantial market volatility and instability 
any such disruptions or continuing volatility may adversely affect the value of our common stock 
the intra day price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share in on december   our common stock closed at a price of per share 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
in addition to current global economic instability in general  the following key factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with our marketed products  fluctuations in our commercial and operating results  announcements of technical or product developments by us or our competitors  market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular  stock market conditions generally  
table of contents governmental regulation  new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings  health care legislation  public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment of the disease states that we are targeting  patent or proprietary rights developments  changes in pricing and third party reimbursement policies for our products  the outcome of litigation involving our products or processes related to production and formulation of those products or uses of those products  competition  and investor reaction to announcements regarding business or product acquisitions 
the number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as of december   there were outstanding stock options and warrants for  shares of common stock  of which  were currently vested and exercisable at an exercise price between and  per share  with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in addition  our operations may be materially affected by conditions in the global markets and economic conditions throughout the world  including the current global economic and market instability 
the global market and economic climate may continue to deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control  including continued economic instability and market volatility  rising interest rates or inflation  terrorism or political uncertainty

our shareholder rights plan and certain charter and by law provisions may deter a third party from acquiring us and may impede the stockholders ability to remove and replace our management or board of directors 
our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan  the purpose of which is to protect stockholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of us that do not offer a fair price to all of our stockholders 
the rights plan may have the effect of dissuading a potential acquirer from making an offer for our common stock at a price that represents a premium to the then current trading price 
our board of directors has the authority to issue  at any time  without further stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock  and to determine the price  rights  privileges and preferences of those shares

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary celgene corporation and its subsidiaries collectively we or our is a global biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases 
in march  we acquired pharmion corporation to enhance our portfolio of therapies for patients with life threatening illnesses worldwide with the addition of pharmion s marketed products  and several products in development for the treatment of hematological and solid tumor cancers 
by combining this new product portfolio with our existing operational and financial capabilities  we enlarged our global market share through increased product offerings and expanded clinical  regulatory and commercial capabilities 
our primary commercial stage products include revlimid  thalomid and vidaza 
revlimid is an oral immunomodulatory drug marketed for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy and for treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk mds associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities 
thalomid is marketed for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe enl  an inflammatory complication of leprosy 
vidaza is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that has been shown to reverse the effects of dna hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re expression 
vidaza was licensed from pharmacia upjohn  now part of pfizer  and is marketed for the treatment of all subtypes of mds 
vidaza was granted orphan drug designation by the fda for the treatment of mds in the united states through may in december  vidaza was granted full marketing authorization by the ec for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with intermediate and high risk mds according to the ipss or cmml with percent marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder  or aml with percent blasts and multi lineage dysplasia  according to who classification 
we continue to invest substantially in research and development  and the drug candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development 
these candidates include our imids compounds  which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important properties in addition to our leading oral anti inflammatory agents and cell products 
we believe that our primary commercial stage products and depth of our product pipeline provide the catalysts for future growth 
for the year ended december   we reported revenue of billion  a net loss of billion and a diluted loss per share of 
revenue increased by million in compared to primarily due to the expanded use of revlimid and the acquisition of former pharmion products  including vidaza and thalomid outside of the united states 
the net loss and loss per share amounts were primarily due to ipr d charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the pharmion acquisition  in addition to the expensing of the october  royalty obligation payment to pfizer that related to the unapproved forms of vidaza 

table of contents factors affecting future results future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our existing products  regulatory approvals of our products and product candidates  the timing and market acceptance of new products launched by us or competing companies  the timing of research and development milestones  challenges to our intellectual property and our ability to control costs 
see also risk factors contained in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
some of the more significant factors that we are focused on include the ability of our products to successfully penetrate and expand in relevant markets revlimid was approved by the fda  the ec  the swissmedic  the tga  and in october by health canada for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy 
in addition  revlimid was approved by the fda and the canadian therapeutic products directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk mds  associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities 
we do not have long term data on the use of the product and cannot predict whether revlimid will continue to gain the acceptance of regulators  physicians  patients and other key opinion leaders as a relatively safe and effective drug that has certain advantages as compared to existing or future therapies 
we are also seeking to introduce revlimid in additional international markets as well as obtaining approvals for additional indications both in the united states and internationally 
a delay in gaining the requisite regulatory approvals could negatively impact our growth plans 
thalomid was approved by the fda for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and is also approved for the treatment and suppression of cutaneous manifestations of enl  an inflammatory complication of leprosy 
in april  the tga approved a supplemental filing granting thalomid marketing approval for use in combination with melphalan and prednisone for patients with untreated multiple myeloma or ineligible for high dose chemotherapy and also granted thalomid marketing approval in combination with dexamethasone for induction therapy prior to high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue  for the treatment of patients with untreated multiple myeloma 
in addition  in april  thalomid was granted full marketing authorization by the ec for use in combination with melphalan and prednisone as a treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
if unexpected adverse experiences are reported in connection with the use of thalomid by patients  physician and patient comfort with the product could be undermined  the commercial success of thalomid could be affected and the acceptance of our other products  including revlimid  may be adversely impacted 
vidaza has been shown to reverse the effects of dna hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re expression 
vidaza was licensed from pharmacia upjohn  now part of pfizer  and was approved by the fda for the treatment of all subtypes of mds 
additionally  vidaza was granted orphan drug designation by the fda for the treatment of aml 
in december  vidaza was granted full marketing authorization by the ec for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with intermediate and high risk mds according to the ipss or cmml with percent marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder  or aml with percent blasts and multi lineage dysplasia  according to who classification 
our ability to advance regulatory and clinical programs many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid stages of research and development and will require the commitment of substantial financial resources  extensive research  development  preclinical testing  clinical trials  manufacturing scale up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale 
moreover  our commercially available products may require additional studies with respect to approved indications as well as new indications pending approval 
if it becomes too expensive to sustain our present commitment of resources on a long term basis  we will be unable to continue certain necessary research and development activities 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that our clinical testing will render satisfactory results  or that we will receive required regulatory approvals for our new products or new indications 
a major objective of our ongoing clinical programs is to broaden our knowledge about the full potential of revlimid and our other proprietary imids compounds and to continue to evaluate them in a broad range of hematological malignancies and other cancers 
our near term focus is on evaluating revlimid as a treatment of cll and nhl 

table of contents competitive risks while competition could limit our products sales  we do not believe that competing products would eliminate their use entirely 
moreover  while generic competitors have and could seek to challenge our thalomid franchise  we own intellectual property which includes  for example  us patents covering our us distribution program for the safe distribution and appropriate use of thalidomide  which all physicians  patients and pharmacies prescribing  receiving or dispensing thalidomide in the united states must follow 
we also have exclusive rights to several issued patents covering thalomid formulations  as well as the use of thalomid in oncology and other therapeutic areas

net product sales compared to revlimid net sales increased by million  or  in compared to primarily due to increased sales in the united states and continued expansion in international markets 
increased market penetration and the increase in duration of patients using revlimid in multiple myeloma accounted for most of the us growth 
international sales growth primarily reflects the impact of the june ec s approval for the use of revlimid for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and continued expansion in international markets and subsequent pricing  reimbursement and marketing approvals in each country 
revlimid continued to receive positive clinical study results which were reported at major medical conferences and in peer reviewed publications 

table of contents thalomid net sales increased by million  or  in compared to primarily due to the inclusion of international sales  resulting from the acquisition of pharmion 
in addition  us price increases were offset by lower sales volumes 
vidaza represents sales recorded subsequent to the march  pharmion acquisition in both the united states and international markets 
alkeran net sales increased by million  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase in unit sales of the injectable form 
the agreement with gsk to distribute  promote and sell alkeran expires on march  and will not be renewed 
net product sales increased by million  or in compared to the change was comprised of net volume increases of million  or  as well as price increases of million  or  and impact of foreign exchange of million  or 
compared to revlimid net sales increased in compared to primarily due to the product s expanded use in the united states resulting from the fda s june approval for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy in multiple myeloma and growth in europe resulting from the june ec s approval for the use of revlimid in this same indication 
also contributing to the increase in sales were price increases and increased sales from our european named patient program  or npp  which offers european patients in need of treatment access to revlimid on a compassionate use basis 
net sales of thalomid were higher in compared to primarily due to price increases  partly offset by lower sales volumes as written prescriptions declined  reflecting the expanded use of revlimid 
alkeran net sales were higher in compared to primarily due to increased prices and a decrease in product returns 
gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances  sales discounts  government rebates  and chargebacks and distributor service fees 
we base our sales returns allowance on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  actual returns history and other factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains  as applicable 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
we analyze historic returns experience on closed lots and historical return trend rates on open lots 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
revlimid is distributed primarily through contracted specialty pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity to date 
vidaza and alkeran are sold in the united states to pharmaceutical wholesalers  who in turn distribute product to physicians  retail pharmacies  hospitals and other institutional customers 
sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 

table of contents government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate amount formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
certain foreign markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid and accordingly the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
chargebacks accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor services accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
on january   the fiscal year national defense authorization act was enacted  which expands tricare to include prescription drugs dispensed by tricare retail network pharmacies 
tricare rebate accruals reflect this program expansion and are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula

the additional trade package configuration enabled all retailers to more efficiently manage their thalomid inventories resulting in lower returns 
this decrease was partly offset by current year thalomid returns  reflecting the impact of a inventory centralization and rationalization initiative conducted by several major pharmacy chains

critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical revenue recognition on collaboration agreements we have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements 
the agreements call for non refundable upfront payments  milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events and in some cases ongoing research funding 
the agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compounds receive regulatory marketing approval 
our revenue recognition policies for all non refundable upfront license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  or sab in addition  we follow the provisions of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after june  eitf provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 

table of contents under arrangements where the license fees and research and development activities can be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  non refundable upfront license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our continued involvement in the research and development process 
revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved  and the milestone payments are due and collectible 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  we would recognize a proportionate amount of the milestone payment upon receipt as revenue that correlates to work already performed and the remaining portion of the milestone payment will be deferred and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations 
gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  government rebates and chargebacks and distributor service fees our gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  government rebates and chargebacks and distributor service fees are based on our sales and or estimates of third party inventories 
our distribution programs in certain markets and our accrual methodologies are described in more detail below 
thalomid is distributed under our steps distribution program 
among other things  steps  which is a proprietary comprehensive education and risk management distribution program  requires prescribers  patients and dispensing pharmacies to participate in a registry and prohibits the filling of a thalomid order unless the physician  patient and pharmacy have all obtained an appropriate authorization number 
automatic refills are not permitted under the program 
each prescription may not exceed a day supply and a new prescription is required with each order 
although we invoice through traditional pharmaceutical wholesalers  all thalomid orders are drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy overnight 
wholesaler stocking of this product is prohibited 
in addition  we do not offer commercial discounts on our products to pharmacies or hospitals and  therefore  have no commercial distributor chargebacks 
revlimid is distributed under the revassist program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of revlimid  and is sold primarily through contracted pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel 
the revassist program includes most of the same attributes of the steps program mentioned above 
vidaza is distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain 
vidaza is not subjected to steps or revassist distribution restrictions 
it may be stocked by multiple wholesalers and prescribed by physicians without our preauthorization 

table of contents alkeran is distributed in a similar fashion as vidaza 
sales returns we base our sales returns allowance on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  actual returns history and other factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains  as applicable 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
we analyze historic returns experience on closed lots and historical return trend rates on open lots 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product  although the prescribing pharmacy hospital may stock thalomid 
revlimid is distributed primarily through contracted specialty pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity to date 
vidaza and alkeran are sold in the united states to pharmaceutical wholesalers  who in turn distribute product to physicians  retail pharmacies  hospitals and other institutional customers 
external factors such as price changes from competitors and introductions of new and generic competing products could have an impact on our sales returns 
our sales returns have not been impacted thus far by such external factors  however  we continue to monitor such factors 
government rebates government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate amount formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
certain foreign markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid and accordingly the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
chargebacks and distributor service fees chargebacks are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor service fees accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
on january   the fiscal year national defense authorization act was enacted  which expands tricare to include prescription drugs dispensed by tricare retail network pharmacies 
tricare rebate accruals reflect this program expansion and are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula 
other gross to net sales accruals we record sales discounts accruals based on payment terms extended to customers 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we adopted the provisions of fin and fsp fin  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
 or fsp fin  effective january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we had no cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption 
we account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
at december   it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
share based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  effective january   which requires that all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized over the remaining service period after the adoption date for additional information refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security established 
the determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment 
factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the issuer s earnings performance  credit rating  asset quality  business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates  length of time that the fair value has been below our cost  our expected future cash flows from the security and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions  which could differ from our assessment 
derivatives and hedging activities sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  as amended  requires that all derivative instruments be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and  if it is  the type of hedging transaction 
for a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period  we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item 
we assess  both at inception and on an on going basis  whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments  if any  to current earnings 
if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings 
we use derivative instruments  including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction  to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates 
the use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives 

table of contents investment in affiliated companies our investment in affiliated companies is comprised of investments in common stock of affiliated companies and investment funds which primarily invest in companies conducting business in life sciences such as biotechnology  pharmaceuticals  medical technology  devices  diagnostics and health and wellness 
if the carrying value of an asset were to exceed its fair value  we would review it to determine if an other than temporary decline in value of the investment has been sustained 
if the investment is determined to have sustained an other than temporary decline in value  the investment would be written down to its fair value 
such an evaluation is judgmental and dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that we consider in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the period of time that the market value is below cost  the financial condition of the investee and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
we evaluate information that we are aware of in addition to quoted market prices  if any  in determining if an other than temporary decline in value exists 
accounting for long term incentive plans we have established a long term incentive plan  or ltip  designed to provide key officers and executives with performance based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre established corporate performance objectives covering a three year period 
we currently have two three year performance cycles running concurrently ending december  and we also anticipate the approval of a new year performance cycle ending december  to be adopted by the board of directors at the end of february performance measures for each ltip are based on the following components in the last year of the three year cycle on earnings per share  on net income and on total revenue  as defined 
payouts may be in the range of to of the participant s salary for the plans 
awards are payable in cash or  at our discretion  in our common stock based upon our stock price at the payout date 
we accrue the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle 
prior to the end of a three year cycle  the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle 
upon a change in control  participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award  or  if higher  an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control 
accruals recorded for the ltip entail making certain assumptions concerning future earnings per share  net income and revenues  as defined  the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used 
accruals for the ltip are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts 
in estimating the accruals  management considers actual results to date for the performance period  expected results for the remainder of the performance period  operating trends  product development  pricing and competition 
valuation of acquired intangible assets and acquired in process research and development we have acquired intangible assets primarily through business combinations 
when identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  are acquired we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  business combinations  or sfas  replaced by sfas r for business combinations consummated on or after january  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
it specifies the criteria which intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet in order to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate impairment might have occurred 
our identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization 
sfas requires that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas sfas requires  among other things  that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
we review our intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
in the future  events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain other intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets are impaired which may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions 
although investments may be subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
at december   our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale  our note payable and certain foreign currency forward contracts 
marketable securities available for sale at december   our marketable securities available for sale consisted of us treasury fixed rate securities  us government sponsored agency fixed rate securities  us government sponsored agency mortgage backed fixed rate securities  federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  guaranteed fixed rate corporate debt  private cash fund shares and a marketable equity security 
us government sponsored agency securities include general unsecured obligations of the issuing agency  including issues from the federal home loan bank  or fhlb  fannie mae  and freddie mac 
us government sponsored agency mortgage backed securities include fixed rate asset backed securities issued by fannie mae  freddie mac and the government national mortgage association  or gnma 
fdic guaranteed corporate debt includes obligations of bank holding companies that meet certain criteria set forth under the temporary liquidity guaranty program  or tlgp  and is unconditionally guaranteed by the fdic 

table of contents fannie mae  freddie mac  fhlb and gnma are regulated by the recently established federal housing finance agency  or fhfa 
on september   the us government  through the fhfa and the us treasury  announced that it was placing both fannie mae and freddie mac into conservatorship  with the fhfa assuming their day to day operations 
on that same day  the us treasury established a new secured lending credit facility available to fannie mae and freddie mac  which is intended to serve as an ultimate liquidity backstop 
this action  in essence  implemented the temporary liquidity backstop authority granted to the us treasury by congress in july  and will be available until december these measures were taken with the goal of preserving the value of the debt and mortgage backed securities issued by these us government sponsored agencies as well as to ensure that these agencies have future access to capital 
the us treasury and the federal reserve bank  or fed  continue to monitor the capital requirements and access to liquidity for the us government sponsored agencies 
working with the congress and the office of the president  the us treasury and the fed have pledged to continue to provide capital and liquidity to the us government sponsored agencies 
we have not recorded any impairments against our holdings in these securities 
marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value  held for an unspecified period of time and intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  which are deemed to be temporary  are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
the amortization  along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges  is included in interest and investment income  net 
as of december   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows duration less than more than in thousands year to years to years years total principal amount fair value average interest rate note payable in december  we purchased an active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  manufacturing facility and certain other assets and liabilities from siegfried 
at december   the fair value of our note payable to siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note of million see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates generally will result in a decrease in the fair value of the note 
the note is denominated in swiss francs and its fair value will also be affected by changes in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
the carrying value of the note reflects the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate and swiss interest rates 
foreign currency forward contracts we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 

table of contents we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against changes in foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily associated with us dollar denominated expenses incurred by subsidiaries in europe 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily associated with product sales in europe 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly  to the extent effective  any unrealized gains or losses on them are reported in other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings 
any ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in other income expense  net 
the foreign currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at december  had an aggregate notional amount of approximately million and had settlement dates within months 
the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of million at december  and is reflected in other current assets of million and other current liabilities of million 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding denominated in various currencies  including euros  swiss francs  british pounds  japanese yen and us dollars  with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million and expiring within months 
the foreign currency forward contracts are economic hedges of certain assets and liabilities that are remeasured through earnings each period along with the underlying hedged item 
at december   the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was a net liability of million and is included in other current liabilities 
although not predictive in nature  we believe a hypothetical threshold reflects a reasonably possible near term change in foreign currency rates 
assuming that the december  exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical  the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately million 
however  since the contracts either hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies or hedge assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entities functional currencies  any change in the fair value of the contract would be either reported in other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings or remeasured through earnings each period along with the underlying hedged item
