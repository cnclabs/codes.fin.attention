item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year our fiscal year is from november to october unless otherwise stated  references to the years   and relate to the fiscal years ended october    and  respectively 
references to future years also relate to our fiscal year ending october critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  and have identified the policies relating to the following areas as those that are significant to our financial statement presentation  and require difficult  subjective  or complex judgments revenue recognition capitalized product development costs valuation of our deferred income taxes valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and identified intangible assets our discussion of these policies is intended to supplement  but not replace  the more detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies and disclosures contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues from three sources subscription revenues  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our online  web based products  license revenues from non cancelable perpetual license agreements  and related professional and support services and other revenue 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  access to our online subscription products has been provided to the customer or the perpetual courseware has been delivered  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable  and the collectability of the fee is probable 
revenue from the licensing of software under subscription arrangements is recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period starting the later of the first day of the subscription period or when all revenue recognition criteria identified above have been met 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
amounts due under non cancelable subscription agreements are not recognized in accounts receivable or deferred revenue until such amounts are invoiced to the customer 
we also provide professional services  which consist of training and implementation services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
training and implementation services are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
revenues from these services are recognized separately upon delivery where there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable 
software support revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period 

table of contents for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 
if collectability of the fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as payments are received from the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as the payments become due provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
capitalized product development costs 
our investments in product development are significant  and the rules that govern how these costs are accounted for in our financial statements can have a significant impact on our operating results from period to period 
our product development costs relate to the research  development  enhancement  and maintenance of our perpetual and subscription based software products 
we account for software development costs in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
costs related to the initial design and development of new products and the routine enhancement and maintenance of existing products are expensed as incurred 
when projects reach technological feasibility we begin capitalization of the related project costs 
capitalization ends when a product is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenues related to license fees and subscriptions 
we evaluate our capitalized costs on a quarterly basis to determine if the unamortized cost related to any product  or group of products  exceeds its estimated net realizable value 
estimating net realizable value requires us to use judgment in projecting future revenues and cash flows to be generated by the product and thereby quantifying the amount  if any  to be written off 
actual cash flows realized could differ materially from those estimated 
in addition  any future changes to our software product offerings could result in write offs of previously capitalized costs and have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations 
our analysis as of october  and resulted in impairment charges on these assets of million and million  respectively 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
our accounting policy for the valuation of deferred income taxes is considered critical for several reasons 
significant judgment is required in the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance 
in addition  income tax accounting rules  in combination with purchase accounting rules applied in the acquisition of lightspan in  resulted in a complex tax accounting situation in which  until  we have not recognized tax benefits on operating losses or on the realization of deferred tax assets  but regardless of our operating results  have been recognizing tax expense on future tax liabilities related to tax deductible goodwill 
the majority of our deferred tax assets represent net operating loss carryforwards which are available to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards include those acquired in the acquisition of lightspan in  as well as carryforward losses that existed prior to  or were incurred after  the acquisition 
our ability to realize the benefit of these loss carryforwards is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income  our history of cumulative operating losses over the past several years has led to our current assessment that it is more likely than not that our net deferred taxes will not be realized 
as a result  our deferred tax assets are fully reserved and will remain fully reserved until the related tax benefits are realized through the generation of taxable income in a particular year  or until we can demonstrate a history of generating taxable income 

table of contents until  our calculation of net deferred tax assets excluded a deferred tax liability related to tax deductible goodwill 
the timing of the reversal of this difference was considered indefinite because it would not reverse until the underlying assets that created the goodwill were disposed of or sold 
in  the goodwill was determined to be fully impaired  and as a result  the deferred tax liability associated with tax deductible goodwill was reversed 
goodwill and identified intangible assets 
goodwill and identified intangible assets are recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the tangible assets acquired 
most of the companies we have acquired have not had significant tangible assets 
as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price paid in acquisitions has been allocated to identified intangible assets and or goodwill 
identified intangible assets are amortized to expense over their expected useful lives and goodwill is not amortized 
once established  these assets are subject to periodic impairment assessments to determine if their current carrying values are recoverable based on information available at the time these assessments are made 
significant assumptions and estimates are required in making these assessments 
accordingly  the assumptions and estimates we use in implementing this policy affect the amount of identified intangible asset amortization and impairment charges  if any  reflected in our operating results 
our impairment assessments at october  resulted in the elimination of goodwill and a related impairment charge of million  and impairment charges of million on identified intangible technology and customer assets acquired in previous acquisitions 
there were no impairment charges on identified intangible assets or goodwill in general factors affecting our financial results there are a number of general factors that affect our results from period to period 
these factors are discussed below 
revenue 
we are transitioning our business model from one that sells one time perpetual licenses to our software  for which revenue is generally recognized up front upon delivery  to one that sells subscription based products  for which revenue is recognized over the subscription period 
as a result  this transition will affect the comparability of our revenues from period to period until it is complete 
the transition became most evident in when we introduced many of our new subscription based products 
as subscription revenues grow as a percentage of total revenues  we expect our period to period revenues to become more comparable and predictable 

table of contents because subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the future subscription period  changes in subscription revenue lag behind changes in orders for subscription products 
periods of strong subscription order growth and increasing deferred revenue balances are generally followed by periods of strong subscription revenue growth  and vice versa 
in  a meaningful  but declining portion of our revenues continued to be derived from sales of perpetual licenses to our software products 
these revenues are reported as license fees in our consolidated statement of operations 
changes in the quantity and size of individual license fee transactions can have a significant impact on revenues in a period 
our business is also seasonal  with the largest portion of our license fees typically coming in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  and professional service fees being the greatest during periods in which schools are in session 
subscription revenues are less seasoned because they are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
while this seasonality does not generally impact the comparability of our annual results  it can significantly impact our results from quarter to quarter 
gross profit 
our gross profit during a period is dependent on a number of factors 
license fee revenues historically have had high gross profit due to the low direct cost of delivering these products 
as a result  the mix of license fee revenues to total revenues in a given period significantly influences reported total gross profit 
in addition  a large portion of our costs of revenue are fixed in nature 
these costs include amortization of capitalized software development and purchased technology  depreciation and other infrastructure costs to support our hosted subscription services  customer support operations  and full time professional services personnel who deliver our training services 
accordingly  increases in revenues allow us to leverage these costs resulting in higher gross profit  while decreases in revenues have the opposite effect 
operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses are substantially fixed in nature 
however  certain components such as our provision for bad debts  professional fees  and other expenses can vary based on business results  individual events  or initiatives we may be pursuing at various times throughout the year 
incentive compensation is a significant variable component of our sales and marketing expenses  approximating to of total revenues in any given period 
sales and marketing expenses also include costs such as travel  tradeshows  and conferences that can vary with revenue activity or individual events that occur during the period 
product maintenance and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations does not reflect our total level of spending in these areas 
costs to enhance or maintain existing products  or to develop products prior to achieving technological feasibility  are charged to product maintenance and development expense as incurred 
costs incurred to develop new products after technological feasibility is achieved  which represent the majority of our total development spending  are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenues 
accordingly  product maintenance and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations can fluctuate from period to period  in terms of both total dollars and as a percentage of revenue  based on the nature and timing of activities occurring during the period 

table of contents amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of certain identified intangible assets acquired through various acquisitions 
while these expenses are generally predictable from period to period because they are fixed over the course of their individual useful lives  they can be affected by events and other factors that result in impairment of these assets and a corresponding reduction in future amortization 
non gaap financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations includes non gaap financial measures  identified in the reconciliations below  that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures have been used because we believe they are useful to investors by providing greater transparency to supplemental information used in our internal financial and operational analysis 
investors are encouraged to review the following reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures used herein to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures as provided with our consolidated financial statements 
reconciliation of gaap net loss and loss per share to non gaap net loss and loss per share before impairments  restructuring and other charges and benefits in thousands  except per share amounts net loss net loss  as reported goodwill impairment income tax benefit related to goodwill impairment change restructuring  impairment and other charges net loss before impairments  restructuring and other charges and benefits loss per share basic and diluted loss per share  as reported goodwill impairment income tax benefit related to goodwill impairment charge restructuring  impairment and other charges loss per share before impairments  restructuring and other charges and benefits basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding gaap 
table of contents reconciliation of gaap operating expense to non gaap operating expenses before impairments  restructuring and other charges in thousands total operating expenses  as reported goodwill impairment restructuring  impairment and other charges benefit operating expenses before impairments  restructuring and other charges overview of financial results the transition of our company to a software as a service saas business model that began in continued throughout  and most of although revenues in continued to be adversely affected by declining emphasis on sales of legacy perpetual products and related software maintenance  strong growth in subscription revenues on our saas products have now substantially offset these declines 
compared to  total revenues declined million  or  to million 
our cost management activities throughout the transition have led to significant declines in the costs of operating our business 
together with the moderating revenue declines  these cost declines led to an improvement in our non gaap net loss excluding impairments  restructuring and other charges and benefits  to million  or per share  from million  or per share  in on a gaap basis  our net loss was million for compared to million for  with the increase primarily attributable to the non cash impairment charge to goodwill described below 
in each of the years of our saas transition we have incurred impairment  restructuring and other charges that were generally unrelated to our day to day operating activities  but were a necessary part of our long term transition 
in we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million on goodwill acquired in acquisitions made prior to launching our saas strategy  million in non cash impairment charges on software development costs and previously acquired intangible assets  and million in cash restructuring and other charges related to a transition in our leadership and activities that we believe will ensure continued operating expense savings in by the end of  we completed the first phase of our transition strategy marked by the achievement of double digit order and revenue growth from our new internet based subscription products  the moderation of our product investment to levels consistent with our long term business model  reduction in our cost structure to ensure we move closer to profitability in  and the transition to a new generation of leadership to execute the next phase of our strategy 
we will continue in to execute the next phase of our long term strategy  focusing on refining our interactions with customers  building out our product capabilities and how we package and sell them in the market  and improving the overall experience of our customers 
we will continue to develop our sales organization and look forward to building continuous relationships with our customers throughout the entire subscription life cycle 
the financial effects of the transition to subscription products  however  may continue to adversely affect the comparability of our year over year financial results in the near term 
this and other risks we face in our business are discussed in more detail in item a of part i of this report 

table of contents results of operations our discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section above captioned general factors affecting our financial results 
revenues the following tables summarize certain key information to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of revenues sales order information in thousands amount change from amount change from amount order value subscriptions license fees services percent of total order value subscriptions license fees services 
table of contents revenue by category in thousands amount change from amount change from amount subscriptions license fees services vs 
total revenues decreased million  or  to million in subscription revenues increased million  or  to million as strong growth in subscription product orders in and were recognized as revenue over the portion of the subscription periods occurring in while subscription revenue growth was strong  it was not sufficient to fully offset a decline in license fees and services revenues 
our strategic shift away from legacy perpetual software products resulted in a million  or  decline in license fee revenues to million 
services revenues declined to million due primarily to a decline in software support revenues on previously purchased perpetual products 
total orders declined from million in to million in  reflecting a slowing of orders in the second half of the fourth quarter of as news worsened on the broader us economy and school districts put spending decisions on hold as they evaluated the effects on their budgets 
the order decline also reflects the continuing transition from selling products that are licensed on a perpetual basis  which have higher one time selling prices  to those that are licensed on a subscription basis  which have lower selling prices but are renewable at the end of each subscription period 
vs 
total revenues decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to the million decline in perpetual license fee revenues that reflected our shifting sales emphasis from legacy perpetual products to subscription products delivered on ple 
subscription revenues increased compared to and surpassed license revenue as a percent of total revenue 
services revenues declined from on a decline in revenues from professional services and technical services  which are tied closely to perpetual license orders 
gross profit to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of gross profit  the following tables summarize the percentage of total revenue  and the gross profit percentage for each revenue category 
table of contents gross profit percentage increase decrease revenue category to to subscriptions license fees services total asset impairment charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively  are reflected in the total gross profit percentage in the table  but are not reflected in the individual revenue category gross profit percentages 
percentage of total revenue revenue category subscriptions license fees services total vs 
the total gross profit percentage declined to in  and includes the negative effect of million in asset impairment charges which had the effect of decreasing reported margins by percentage points compared to a total gross profit margin in of the changes from to in the gross profit percentages of each revenue category were as follows the increase in the subscription gross profit percentage  from in to in  reflects the lower delivery and support costs of our internet based subscription products 
subscription revenues increased million while increases in subscription related product development amortization  royalty costs and support services increased only million  resulting in a gross profit percentage on incremental subscription revenues of approximately 
the decline in the license fee gross profit percentage  from in to in  was the result of lower license fee revenues  as discussed above  on a base of primarily fixed costs including amortization of product development and purchased intangibles  and distribution costs 

table of contents the decrease in the services gross profit percentage  from in to in  was due to a decrease in the mix of higher margin software support services revenues which are tied closely to perpetual license orders 
vs 
the total gross profit percentage decreased to in from in  primarily due to the decline in higher margin license fee revenue 
higher margin license fee revenues decreased from to of total revenue  while subscription revenues  which were still in an early stage growth period and experiencing lower margins  increased from to of total revenues 
these changes in revenue mix were due to the factors discussed under revenues above 
the changes from to in the gross profit percentages of each revenue category were as follows the decrease in the subscription gross profit percentage  from in to in  was due to an increase in product development amortization on new subscription products released in and  combined with the reallocation of customer support resources from legacy to new subscription products in response to the growth in subscription customers  partially offset by the increase in subscription revenue 
the decline in the license fee gross profit percentage  from in to in  was the result of lower license fee revenues  as discussed above  on a base of primarily fixed costs including amortization of product development and purchased intangibles  and distribution costs 
the increase in the services gross profit percentage  from in to in  was due to improvements in productivity and utilization of resources in our professional services organization  and to an increase in the mix of higher margin software support services revenues which have low variable costs 

table of contents operating expenses to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of our operating expenses  the following table summarizes the amount and percentage change in the amounts from the previous year for certain operating expense line items amount  in thousands increase decrease to to sales and marketing general and administrative product maintenance and development amortization of intangibles operating expenses excluding impairments  restructuring and other charges goodwill impairment  n a n a restructuring  impairment and other charges   n a total operating expenses vs 
total operating expenses in increased to million and included million in impairments  restructuring and other charges 
see further discussion below and note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of these charges 
operating expenses excluding impairments  restructuring and other charges  declined to million in compared to million in sales and marketing expenses declined to million in as compared to million in this decrease primarily reflects improved management of indirect sales and marketing costs and better leveraging of our inside sales resources 
none of the decline was due to a reduction in the number of direct field sales representatives which remained approximately the same from to general and administrative expenses declined to million in as compared to million in  due primarily to reductions in labor and incentive costs and declines in the cost of compliance activities and internal business systems support 
product maintenance and development expenses for were million compared to million for the reduction in product maintenance and development expenses reflects the increasing stability of our ple platform and efficiencies built into delivering new releases of the platform 
total product development spending  which represents the combination of spending on projects that are capitalized and those that are expensed  was million in  or of total revenues  compared to total spending in of million  or of total revenues 
the decline reflects completion of a three year product roadmap for the first phase of our saas strategy initiated in late amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of identified intangible assets  other than technology  acquired in acquisitions 
amortization of million in represented a decrease of from as certain assets acquired in earlier acquisitions became fully amortized during 
table of contents operating expenses in include a non cash impairment charge of million on goodwill acquired in multiple acquisitions between and the assets from these acquisitions are not a material part of our current saas strategy 
as described in our critical accounting policies  we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill be reviewed for potential impairment annually  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill might exceed its current fair value 
one of the indicators of impairment is a sustained decline in a company s share price whereby market capitalization of the company is less than its book value for an extended period of time 
we began to experience such a decline starting in march after trading in a range near our book value throughout the summer  we experienced a further decline in our stock price as the financial markets reacted to the credit crisis facing major lending institutions  and worsening conditions in the overall economy 
additionally the company has experienced operation losses during the past three years while the company has experienced growth in subscription product orders in fiscal and fiscal  subscription revenue was not sufficient to fully offset a decline in license fees and service revenues during those years 
as a result of these factors  we concluded in the fourth quarter of that our recorded goodwill was impaired 
under sfas  the determination of the amount of the impairment required that the fair values of our assets and liabilities be determined as if we had been acquired in a hypothetical business combination with a purchase price equal to the market capitalization of our company as of october   adjusted for certain factors that might reasonably affect the value of our company if purchased in an actual acquisition 
the estimates and assumptions used in determining the hypothetical purchase price and fair value determinations are inherently subject to uncertainty 
under accounting rules for business combinations  goodwill exists only if the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets of the acquired entity 
our impairment analysis concluded that the purchase price as determined above was less than the sum of the fair value of our identified tangible and intangible assets  less the fair value of our liabilities 
accordingly  no value was assigned to goodwill resulting in full impairment of goodwill and a related non cash charge to operating results of million 
the impairment of goodwill is not expected to have any impact on our day to day business operations  liquidity or long term saas strategy 
impairment  restructuring and other charges consist of million in non cash impairment charges on previously acquired intangible assets  and million in cash and non cash charges related to achieving continued cost efficiencies in our saas business model  and the transition of our ceo in late vs 
total operating expenses in were million  down from million in  which included million in impairment  restructuring and other charges 
excluding these charges in both years  operating expenses declined to million 
sales and marketing expenses declined to million in as compared to million in this decrease primarily reflects changes made early in to reduce the level of field sales resources  concentrate the remaining resources in the territories with the largest market potential  and better leverage of our inside sales organization 
also contributing to the decline was a decrease in commissions resulting from the decrease in revenues 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in due primarily to reductions in labor costs  external audit fees  and legal expenses 

table of contents product maintenance and development expenses for were million compared to million reported for the reduction in product maintenance and development expenses reflects lower maintenance costs on legacy products and lower start up costs on new product investments 
total product development spending  which represents the combination of spending on projects that are capitalized and those that are expensed  was million in  or of total revenues  compared to total spending in of million  or of total revenues 
amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of identified intangible assets  other than technology  acquired in acquisitions 
amortization of million in represented a decrease of from as certain assets acquired in earlier acquisitions were either impaired during or became fully amortized during interest income interest income decreased from million in to million in this decrease is due to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances as well as a decline in interest rates earned on these balances 
interest income decreased from million in to million in this decrease reflected a decline in our average cash and cash equivalents balances  partially offset by higher interest rates earned on these investments 
income taxes as discussed earlier under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates  our net deferred tax assets  excluding the deferred tax liability relating to tax deductible goodwill  are fully reserved 
accordingly  we do not record a current income tax benefit related to our current year operating losses 
prior to  certain tax deductible goodwill could not be used to offset other net deferred tax assets resulting in the recording of income tax expense related to this liability of million in and in  the full impairment of the tax deductible goodwill  as discussed above  resulted in the reversal of the cumulative deferred tax liability and a corresponding income tax benefit of million 
we implemented the provisions of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and interpretation of fasb statement no 
 effective november  the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements was not material and no cumulative effect adjustment was recorded to the november  balance of accumulated deficit 
we did however increase our gross deferred tax assets by million  related to the increase in the value of our net operating losses due to adjustments to tax limitations on the utilization of net operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources at october   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents totaling million and net billed accounts receivable of million and unbilled commitments from customers under non cancelable subscription contracts totaling million  of which million is expected to be collected in in addition  on june   we entered into a three year senior secured credit facility which provides us with a revolving line of credit up to the lesser of million or one times our trailing twelve months subscription and maintenance revenue 
under the agreement  we have the option of selecting an interest rate for any drawdown under the facility equal to the applicable prime or libor rate plus a sliding margin that is based on the amount of borrowings outstanding 
borrowings under the agreement are secured by all of our assets 
financial covenants are limited to annual maximums on capitalized software development spending  and minimum quarterly thresholds of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda which are tested only when the unused portion of the line of credit plus our cash and cash equivalents on hand is less than million 
we capitalized legal and banking fees of  associated with this credit facility in these costs are being amortized over the three year term of the agreement 
there were no draw downs on this facility in or 
table of contents our cash provided by operations declined to million in from million  due primarily to the decline in total orders discussed above  partially offset by reductions in overall spending 
cash used in investing activities declined to million in  from million in the significant decline in net cash used in investing activities from to reflected a reduction in our product investment requirements based on the completion of the conversion of our extensive content to the ple environment 
these changes from to resulted in a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended october  while our investing in product development has been significant over the past three years  we expect positive cash flow from operations to continue in future periods 
see the section captioned outlook below for a further discussion of expected fiscal year cash balances 
our principal commitments consist of future minimum payments due under operating leases  royalty and non cancelable software license agreements 
in addition  any future borrowings under our revolving loan agreement as discussed above would require future use of cash 
at october   the future minimum payments under these commitments were as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total year or less to years to years more than years operating leases royalty agreements non cancelable software license agreements capital leases obligations total a number of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew 
our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these options 
purchase orders are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under contracts that we can cancel without significant penalty are not included in the table above 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  anticipated cash provided by operating activities  and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and extent of product development expenditures  order volume  and the timing and collection of receivables 

table of contents disclosures about off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october  fiscal year outlook while our view of fiscal is complicated by the effect of current economic conditions on school budgets  we believe we can achieve high single digit subscription order growth  low double digit subscription revenue growth  and continued improvement in subscription margins in we expect cost of revenue and operating expenses in to decline from fiscal amounts excluding impairments  restructuring and other charges  by nearly million  and our capitalized software product investment to moderate to between million and million 
we expect cash balances will decline seasonally throughout the first half of the fiscal year  and build throughout the second half of the year  with year end cash balances expected to achieve or slightly exceed year end fiscal balances 
interest rate risk on june   we entered into a three year senior secured credit facility which provides us with a revolving line of credit up to the lesser of million or one times our trailing twelve months subscription and maintenance revenue 
under the agreement we have the option of selecting an interest rate for any drawdown under the facility equal to the applicable prime or libor rate plus a sliding margin that is based on the amount of borrowings outstanding 
there were no borrowings outstanding at october  or foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign operations are not a significant component of our business  and as a result  risks relating to foreign currency fluctuation are considered minimal
