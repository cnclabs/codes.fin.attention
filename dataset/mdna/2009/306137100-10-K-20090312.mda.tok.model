investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview our results did not meet our expectations in while our revenues increased  they did not reach our initial projection for the year 
in addition  our earnings and our gross margins fell 
we attribute the shortfall in revenues  and the resulting decline in earnings and gross margin  to the general economic slowdown that has affected both the us and the global economies 
our revenues for the first two quarters of the year were on target with the annual projection we announced in february  as late as the first week in september   our revenues continued to be on track towards meeting our targets 
then the crisis in the financial markets including the lehman brothers bankruptcy filing and the weakened banking industry  which lead to a tightening of credit seemed to significantly curtail the spending by our current and prospective end users 
orders we had expected did not materialize 
our results for the third quarter ended up falling well short of our expectations 
given our results for the third quarter  and the continuing economic downturn  we revised our projections for the fourth quarter 
although the revised target was lower than our original projections  we are pleased that we exceeded both our revised revenue and our revised earnings target for the fourth quarter 
in furtherance of our continuing strategy to grow the company for the long term  we continued to invest in both personnel and other assets throughout the first eight months of to grow and to support the then current level of business and the level of business we were projecting for the remainder of and beyond 
when the expected revenue did not come in  our increased expenses  combined with the revenue shortfall  reduced our earnings and our gross margin 
while our results fell short of our goals  we believe that our results indicate that we are still on the right track 
our revenues for the full year increased to million from million in this is a twelve percent year over year increase in revenues 
just over half of our revenues in came from our vtl product  both the basic version and a version that was enhanced with deduplication capability in we anticipate further revenue growth in  although growth could be constrained or undermined by the global economic slowdown 
net income for the year was million  compared with net income of million in approximately one third of the net income number million was attributable to a net income tax benefit  which included a non recurring million tax benefit which we recorded for that year 
we had stock based compensation expense which relates to stock options and restricted stock we grant to employees  officers and directors as part of our incentive compensation plan  and to some consultants as payment for services of million in and million in  which is reflected in the net income number for each year 
we look to operating income as another measure of our progress 
this number enables us to measure and to compare our results of operations from one year to the next 
operating income for was million  compared with million in these numbers again include stock based compensation expense 
we attribute the decline in operating income from to primarily to the increase in expenses that outpaced our revenue growth 
another important measure of our business is gross margin 
among other things  gross margin measures our ability to scale our business 
our gross margins tend to increase as our software license revenue increases 
we incur research and development expenses before the product is offered for licensing 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering and testing  but also include other items such as the depreciation and amortization of hardware and software used in development 
we also have expenses for software support  sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions 
our gross margin for was compared with for the impact of the equity based compensation expense on gross margin in and was equivalent to and  respectively 
the decline in gross margin is a result of the investments we made in our business  particularly in the sales and marketing and the technical support area  outpacing our revenue growth 
operating margin is a measure of operating efficiency 
our operating margin decreased 
in  our operating margin was  compared with in the impact of the equity based compensation expense on operating margin in and was equivalent to each year 
as it has been in the past  our focus for will continue to be on managing our business with a view towards long term success and growth 
it is certainly our goal to keep making the company more profitable  but we do not manage the business to meet quarterly or annual earnings targets 
our continued ability to generate cash from operations allows us to put money back into the business to continue its growth 
in  we continued to invest in research and development and in sales and marketing  along with other areas  to build on our momentum  to design new products  and to enhance our existing products to position the company for future growth 
even as the economy weakened  we continued to invest in areas that we believe will provide a long term benefit 
while we will be mindful of economic conditions  and we will seek to make only prudent investments in our business  we will continue to invest in the company in in particular  we anticipate continued investment in our sales and our marketing functions 
we anticipate that our cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses will all increase in to continue to create industry leading  cutting edge network storage solutions  we hired additional software development engineers and quality assurance engineers in these software engineers design and test the software products that are or will be sold by our oem partners and resellers 
continuing to deliver new and enhanced products to meet the demands of the storage market is necessary for us to remain competitive and to continue our growth 
we also increased our sales force and our marketing team 
these increases are intended to help us to promote our products to potential customers by highlighting the capabilities of the products 
we also continued to increase our technical support team 
the expanded technical support team responds to questions and technical issues from end users of our products and from our resellers and oem partners 
providing top notch technical support to these groups enhances our ability to continue to make sales 
end users who are satisfied with our technical support are more likely to order additional products from us 
resellers and oem partners who are happy with our technical support  and whose end users are satisfied  will be more likely to recommend our current products and less likely to consider other providers for future products 
the key factors we look to for our future business prospects are our ability to establish and to expand relationships with key industry oems  and sales by those oems  our ability to establish and to expand relationships with resellers  and sales and re orders by those resellers  growth in deferred revenue  the development and sales of our new products  re orders from existing customers  and the growth of the overall market for data protection and storage solutions 
oem relationships continue to be important to us for two main reasons first  sales by our oem partners contribute to our revenues 
overall  revenue from oems accounted for approximately forty five percent of our revenues in  down slightly from forty eight percent in on an absolute basis  revenues from oems grew four percent from to million in revenues from emc  our largest oem  decreased compared with due to product transition that had a negative impact on sales in the second and third quarters 
our revenues from sun grew to million in we regard the simultaneous year over year increase in revenues from oems and year over year decline in the percentage of our revenues attributable to oems to be an indicator of the health of our business 
it shows that even as our oem customers continue to grow the market for solutions powered by our technology  we are diversifying our product mix and our sales channels 
we anticipate that oems will again account for over forty percent of our revenues in we expect that at least two oems will account for at least ten percent of our revenues in accordingly  the loss of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
second  having our products selected by respected  established industry leaders signals to customers  resellers and other potential oem partners that our products are quality products that add value to their enterprise 
before licensing software  oem partners typically undertake broad reviews of many of the competing software solutions available 
the choice of our products by major industry participants validates both the design and the capabilities of the products and our product roadmaps 
in  both sun and emc launched new ranges of products that incorporate our vtl technology 
sun incorporated our data deduplication technology into their products 
we signed oem agreements with additional companies in  both in the united states and china 
we will continue to seek additional oem opportunities in the future 
we do everything we can to assure that our products meet the needs of our oem partners and their customers 
however  we cannot control decisions by our oem partners to change their product or marketing mix in ways that impact sales of products licensed by the oems from us 
over our history  we have entered into oem agreements with two tier oem companies  and with another significant company in the computer  networking and communications products business  only to see those oem partners change their strategies and make significant reductions in their commitments to the products that incorporate our technology 
we continue to enhance our reseller program and resellers are expected to remain a significant channel for sales of our products 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution providers to assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these resellers typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  or combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
as service providers to companies  resellers reputations are dependent on satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
resellers have wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs 
if resellers determine that a product they have been providing to their customers is not functioning as promised  or is not providing adequate return on investment  or if the customers are not satisfied with the level of support they are receiving from the suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offer different solutions to their customers 
additional sales by resellers are therefore an important indicator of our business prospects 
sales from our resellers increased twenty percent in to million 
increasing sales from resellers remains an area of focus for us and in we made significant investments in our sales force and in our marketing team to help grow these sales 
we also have instituted  and we will be instituting further  support  training and incentive programs intended to increase sales by our resellers 
in  we signed agreements with new resellers worldwide 
the type of resellers with whom we are signing agreements has continued to evolve 
while we still sign agreements with strong local and regional resellers  we have also entered into reseller agreements with national and multi national resellers who have their own distribution networks 
the enhanced distribution and marketing networks offered by these larger resellers should help us to continue to grow our sales 
we also terminated relationships with resellers who we believed were not properly selling our products in we will continue to enter into relationships with resellers and to discontinue relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts attributable to future support and maintenance of our products 
the level of deferred revenue is an important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support for our products is sold for fixed periods of time 
maintenance and support agreements are typically for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess of one year 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products or by our oem partners and resellers  then they will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
an increase in deferred revenues thus indicates growth in our installed base and end user and oem satisfaction with our products and our maintenance and support services 
our deferred revenue increased to million as of december   compared with million as of december  we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in consolidation in the network storage market continued in the consolidation did not have a significant impact on our revenue 
the data protection and the storage solutions markets continued to grow in the amount of data generated each day continues to grow 
all of that data has to be stored  and prudent organizations need ways to backup the data efficiently and to restore the data quickly and effectively in the event of a failure 
while we expect these markets to continue to grow  we cannot predict the impact that the global economic crisis will have on these markets in sales from outside the united states  including china  remain an area of growth 
our revenues from non oem international sales  while still lower than our domestic non oem revenues  grew thirty percent compared with we will continue to invest in our international operations in our expenses increased in from million in to million in this is in line with the increase from to  which was 
the increase in expenses outpaced our increase in revenues 
most of the increase in expenses had been incurred or planned before the global economic situation deteriorated in the second half of although the increase in expenses hurt our profitability for  we believe that the investments we have made in our business will provide a pay off in the long run through increased sales and market share 
included in our operating expenses for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
we will continue to invest in infrastructure and personnel to maintain and enhance our leading edge designs and to support our customers  but we will continue to do so in a controlled  cost effective manner 
we expect to continue to be affected by seasonality of the information technology business on a quarterly basis 
historically  information technology spending has been higher in the fourth and second quarters of each calendar year  and somewhat slower in the other quarters  particularly the first quarter 
while our results were skewed by the impact of the collapse in the financial sector in third quarter  our quarterly results reflected this seasonality in  and we anticipate that our quarterly results for will show the effects of seasonality as well 
accounting rules relating to share based compensation expense continued to have a negative impact on our earnings in on an on going basis we weigh the impact of the expense on our consolidated financial statements against the impact of discontinuing the grant of equity based compensation to our worldwide workforce 
it continues to be our view that the opportunity to participate in the growth of our company is an important motivating factor for our current employees and a valuable recruiting tool for new employees 
we will thus continue to apply the criteria and the methodology we have used in the past to determine grants of stock options or other equity based compensation to our employees 
for the management of our business and the review of our progress  we will continue to look to our results before share based compensation expense 
we will use these non gaap financial measures in making operating decisions because they measure the results of our day to day operations and because they provide a more consistent basis for evaluating and comparing our results across different periods 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the year ended december  our operating expenses increased from million in to million in included in our operating expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r 
net income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
included in our net income for the year ended december  was a tax provision of million compared with the year ended december  which included an income tax benefit of million  that primarily consisted of a reversal of certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances as a result of our continuing positive operating results and financial projections 
our revenue growth for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in was due to growth in both our software license revenue and maintenance revenues 
this growth in revenues was primarily driven by increases in i demand for our data protection and network storage solution software  ii maintenance revenue from new and existing customers and iii sales to our resellers  direct end users and oem partners 
however  during the second half of  our revenue growth slowed  particularly software license revenues  as a result of the difficult economic conditions encountered as a result of the disruptions in the global financial markets  specifically in north america  when compared with the same period in because of our well established installed customer base and growing number of software licenses sold  our revenue from maintenance agreements were not significantly impacted as compared with our software license revenues as a result of the downturn in information technology spending experienced during the second half of revenue contribution from our oem partners increased in absolute dollars for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in revenue from resellers  distributors and direct end users increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in expenses increased in all aspects of our business to support our continued growth 
in support of our continued growth and expansion both domestically and internationally  we increased our worldwide headcount to employees as of december   as compared with employees as of december  finally  we continue to invest in our infrastructure with our continued capital expenditures  particularly with purchases of equipment for support of our existing and future product offerings 
revenues year ended december  revenues software license revenue maintenance revenue software services and other revenue total revenues year over year percentage growth software license revenue maintenance revenue software services and other revenue total percentage growth software license revenue software license revenue is comprised of software licenses sold through our oems  value added resellers and distributors to end users and  to a lesser extent  directly to end users 
these revenues are recognized when  among other requirements  we receive a customer purchase order or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold and the software and permanent key codes are delivered to the customer 
we sometimes receive nonrefundable royalty advances and engineering fees from some of our oem partners 
these arrangements are evidenced by a signed customer contract  and the revenue is recognized when the software product master is delivered and accepted  and the engineering services  if any  have been performed 
software license revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  software license revenue represented and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of broader market acceptance of our software applications  new product offerings and increased demand for our products from our expanding base of customers  we continued to experience increased software license revenues 
however  during the second half of  as a result of the difficult economic conditions encountered as a result of the disruptions in the global financial markets  specifically in north america  our software license revenue growth slowed when compared with the same period in overall  during the year ended december   gross software license revenue from our oem partners decreased  while gross software license revenues from our direct end users and resellers increased when compared to the same period in we expect our software license revenue to continue to grow in future periods 
maintenance revenue maintenance revenue is comprised of software maintenance and technical support services 
revenues derived from maintenance and technical support contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance term 
maintenance revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the major factor behind the increase in maintenance revenue was an increase in the number of maintenance and technical support contracts we sold 
as we are in business longer  and as we license more software to new customers and grow our installed customer base  we expect the amount of maintenance and technical support contracts we have to grow as well 
we expect our maintenance revenue to continue to increase primarily because i the majority of our new customers purchase maintenance and support contracts  and ii the majority of our growing existing customer base renewed their maintenance and support contracts after their initial contracts expired 
software services and other revenue software services and other revenues are comprised of professional services primarily related to the implementation of our software  engineering services  and sales of computer hardware 
professional services revenue is recognized in the period that the related services are performed 
revenue from engineering services is primarily related to customizing software product masters for some of our oem partners 
revenue from engineering services is recognized in the period in which the services are completed 
during the years ended december  and  we had transactions in which we purchased hardware and bundled this hardware with our software and sold this bundled solution to our customer base 
a portion of the contractual fees is recognized as revenue when the hardware is delivered to the customer based on its relative fair value 
software services and other revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in software services and other revenue was primarily due to a decrease in computer hardware sales  which declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our professional services revenue decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in the professional services revenue will vary from year to year based upon i the number of software license contracts sold during the year  ii the number of our software license customers who elected to purchase professional services  and or iii the number of professional services contracts that were completed during the year 
we expect professional services revenues to vary from year to year based upon the number of customers who elect to utilize our professional services upon purchasing our software licenses 
the hardware revenue will vary from year to year based upon the number of customers who wish to have us bundle hardware with our software for one complete solution but is expected to grow in when new storage and data protection appliances are offered for sale 
cost of revenues year ended december  total revenues cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue gross profit gross margin cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel and other costs associated with providing software implementations  technical support under maintenance contracts  training  amortization of purchased and capitalized software and share based compensation expense associated with sfas no

cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues also includes the cost of hardware purchased that was resold 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues increased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue was primarily due to the increase in personnel and related costs

our cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue will continue to grow in absolute dollars as our revenues from these services also increase 
gross profit increased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in gross margins decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  even though we had an increase in our gross profit  our gross margins decreased 
generally  our gross margins may fluctuate based on several factors  including i revenue growth levels  ii timing of changes in personnel headcount and related costs  iii our mix of product offerings and services  and iv costs related to the procurement of hardware for our bundled solutions 
share based compensation expense included in the cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue increased in absolute dollars to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively

during the year ended december   we determined that based upon a number of factors  including our then cumulative taxable income over the prior three years and expected profitability in future years  certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable through future earnings 
accordingly  we recognized a significant portion of our deferred tax assets through a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
as of january   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards related to excess compensation deductions from previous year s exercises of stock options 
during  we utilized all of our net loss carryforwards  the benefits of which were credited to additional paid in capital

during the year ended december   we determined that based upon a number of factors  including our then cumulative taxable income over the prior three years and expected profitability in future years  that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable through future earnings 
accordingly  we recognized a significant portion of our deferred tax assets through a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
as of december   our deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance were million 
we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards relate to excess compensation deductions from exercises of stock options and the resulting benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized 
for the year ended december   our provision for income taxes consisted of us taxes  foreign taxes  us federal alternative minimum taxes and state minimum taxes that were expected to be incurred primarily as a result of the limitations on our ability to utilize net operating losses under the alternative minimum tax system and the non deductibility of certain share based compensation expense for income tax purposes that had been recognized for financial statement purposes and foreign taxes 
additionally  during the year ended december   we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our prior history of cumulative pre tax losses and uncertainty about the timing of and ability to generate taxable income in the future and our assessment that the realization of the deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criterion under sfas no

net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although our net income in decreased when compared with  and increased when compared with  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during  when compared with and  was primarily related to the following adjustments i the impact of non cash charges  particularly relating to deferred income taxes  stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization  and ii adjustments for net changes in operating assets and liabilities  particularly changes in our accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses  and our deferred revenues 
in addition  net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the tax benefits recognized as a result of excess stock based compensation deductions and exercises of stock options  particularly in and sfas no 
r requires tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions to be presented as cash outflows from operating activities

there were insignificant adjustments for the impact of non cash income tax benefits for the year ended december  net cash provided in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with net cash used in investing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in investing activities for each year are the sales and purchases of our marketable securities 
these represent the sales  maturities and reinvesting of our marketable securities 
the net cash provided by investing activities from the net sales purchases of securities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts will fluctuate from year to year depending on the maturity dates of our marketable securities 
the cash used to purchase property and equipment was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  as discussed above  and further in note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements  during we used million for the acquisition of assets  while we did not use any cash for acquisitions of assets in the same period of and we continually evaluate opportunities to acquire software licenses and we may continue to make similar investments if we find opportunities that would benefit our business 
we anticipate continued capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our ongoing growth and expansion both domestically and internationally 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash outflows from financing activities result from the repurchase of our outstanding common stock 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million

during and  cash inflows from financing activities was also impacted by the tax benefits recognized as a result of excess stock based compensation deductions and exercises of stock options 
sfas no 
r requires tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions be presented as cash inflows from financing activities 
we recognized tax benefits related to stock based compensation deductions of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were insignificant adjustments for the impact of non cash income tax benefits for the year ended december  as discussed in note fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of auction rate securities we hold  totaling million at par value at december  as of december   million at par value of our investments was comprised of auction rate securities 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process  which allows holders to sell their notes  and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals 
during the first quarter of  we began experiencing failed auctions on auction rate securities 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction  the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short term instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and continue to reset the next auction date every or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
because there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near term and due to our ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity  the auction rate securities were classified as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet at december  our auction rate securities are classified as available for sale securities and are reflected at fair value 
in prior periods during the auction process  which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would qualify as level under sfas no 
however  due to events in credit markets throughout  the auction events for most of these instruments failed  and  therefore  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model as of december  these analyses consider  among other items  the collateral underlying the security  the creditworthiness of the issuer  the timing of the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and an assumption of when the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable and relevant market data  which is limited at this time 
due to these events  we reclassified these instruments as level in and recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value in the aggregate of approximately  with an offsetting entry to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 
we currently believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due primarily to liquidity concerns and not the creditworthiness of the underlying assets  because the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the us government 
in addition  our holdings of auction rate securities represented approximately of our cash equivalents  and marketable securities balance at december   which we believe allows us sufficient time for the securities to return to full value or to be refinanced by the issuer 
because we believe that the current decline in fair value is temporary and based primarily on liquidity issues in the credit markets  any difference between our estimate and an estimate that would be arrived at by another party would have no impact on our earnings  since such difference would also be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we will re evaluate each of these factors as market conditions change in subsequent periods 
as of december   we had million of auction rate securities included within our portfolio of marketable securities 
during we sold million of the auction rate securities at par value 
accordingly  as of december   we had million of auction rate securities remaining 
in connection with our acquisition of ip metrics in july  we were required to make cash payments to the former shareholders of ip metrics  which were contingent on the level of revenues from ip metrics products for a period of twenty four months through june  in  we made payments to the former shareholders of ip metrics totaling  in  we recorded a litigation settlement expense of million relating to a contingent purchase price dispute with two former shareholders of ip metrics 
this settlement was paid out in the first quarter of we currently do not have any debt and our only material cash commitments are related to our office leases 
we have an operating lease covering our corporate office facility that expires in february we also have several operating leases related to offices in the united states and foreign countries 
the expiration dates for these leases range from through the following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for all operating leases as of december year ending december we believe that our current balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and our expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see item a of part i  risk factors 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  deferred income taxes  accounting for share based compensation expense  acquisitions and goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
software license revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among other criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract for nonrefundable royalty advances received from oems or a customer purchase order or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold for each software license resold by an oem  distributor or solution provider to an end user 
the software license fees are fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms range from to days  depending on regional billing practices  and we have not provided any of our customers extended payment terms 
when a customer licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee to maintenance for its fair value based on the contractual maintenance renewal rate 
accounts receivable 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider i historical return rates  ii specific past due accounts  iii analysis of our accounts receivable aging  iv customer payment terms  v historical collections  write offs and returns  vi changes in customer demand and relationships  and vii concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
historically  we have experienced a somewhat consistent level of write offs and returns as a percentage of revenue due to our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in the product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenues and our general and administrative expenses 
deferred income taxes 
consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
 we regularly estimate our ability to recover deferred tax assets  and report such deferred tax assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable 
we also have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimating foreign tax credits 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
this evaluation considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  the effect of temporary differences  the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities  past and projected taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
as of december  and  our deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance  were million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   based on positive evidence from our earnings trends  we recognized a significant portion of our deferred tax assets through a reduction in our deferred tax assets valuation allowance of approximately million 
accounting for share based payments 
as discussed further in note share based payment arrangements to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective method 
we have used and expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of share based compensation expense 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of share based compensation expense reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility based primarily on historical daily price changes of our stock and other factors 
the expected option term is the number of years that we estimate that the stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise 
the estimated expected term of the stock awards issued after december  was determined pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
the expected term of the awards issued prior to january   was determined using the simplified method prescribed in sab no 
additionally  we estimate forfeiture rates based primarily upon historical experiences  adjusted when appropriate for known events or expected trends 
we may adjust share based compensation expense on a quarterly basis for changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of these events and trends  and recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization after january   in the period in which we revised the forfeiture estimate 
if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the share based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended december    and  could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions or estimates are used in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
acquisitions 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas no 
 business combination 
under sfas no 
 the acquiring company allocates the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  including intangible assets that can be identified 
the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
among other sources of relevant information  we use independent appraisals or other valuations to assist in determining the estimated and final recorded fair value of assets and liabilities acquired 
as discussed further in note acquisitions in our consolidated financial statements  during the third quarter of  we purchased certain assets of world venture limited for an aggregate purchase price of million including transaction and closing costs  and recorded approximately million of goodwill as a result of the related fair value appraisals performed 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life 
absent any prior indicators of impairment  we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
as of december   we had million of goodwill and million net of amortization of other identifiable intangible assets 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often if a trigger event occurs 
we amortize identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which typically is three years 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step process based on an evaluation of the reporting unit 
the first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
in the second step  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we compare the goodwill s implied fair value and its carrying value 
if the goodwill s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess 
we evaluate the recoverability of other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset a group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
as discussed further in note acquisitions in our consolidated financial statements  during the third quarter of  we purchased certain assets of world venture limited for an aggregate purchase price of million including transaction and closing costs  and recorded approximately million of goodwill as a result of the related fair value appraisals performed 
as of december   we did not record any impairment charges on either our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks 
our return on our investments in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities which aggregated to million as of december   is subject to interest rate risks 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to manage the market risk of our marketable securities 
if interest rates were to change by from the levels at december   the effect on our financial results would be insignificant 
foreign currency risk 
we have several offices outside the united states 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have not been material since our inception 
if foreign currency exchange rates were to change by from the levels at december   the effect on our other comprehensive income would be insignificant 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure
