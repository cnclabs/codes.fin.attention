item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
electric utility the electric utility segment consists of kcp l  a regulated utility  and  since the july   acquisition date  gmo s regulated utility operations which include its missouri public service and st 
joseph light power divisions 
electric utility serves over  customers located in western missouri and eastern kansas 
customers include approximately  residences   commercial firms  and  industrials  municipalities and other electric utilities 
electric utility s retail revenues averaged approximately of its total operating revenues over the last three years 
since the july   acquisition of gmo  electric utility s retail revenues averaged of its total operating revenues 
wholesale firm power  bulk power sales and miscellaneous electric revenues accounted for the remainder of electric utility s revenues 
electric utility is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter 
electric utility s total electric revenues were of great plains energy s revenues over the last three years 
electric utility s net income accounted for approximately  and of great plains energy s income from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
regulation kcp l and gmo are regulated by the public service commission of the state of missouri mpsc  and kcp l is also regulated by the state corporation commission of the state of kansas kcc  with respect to retail rates  certain accounting matters  standards of service and  in certain cases  the issuance of securities  certification of facilities and service territories 
kcp l and gmo are also subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  southwest power pool  inc spp and north american electric reliability corporation nerc 
kcp l has a ownership interest in the wolf creek generating station wolf creek  which is subject to regulation by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  with respect to licensing  operations and safety related requirements 
missouri and kansas jurisdictional retail revenues averaged approximately and  respectively  of electric utility s total retail revenues since the july   acquisition of gmo 
see item md a  critical accounting policies section and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters 
in september  kcp l filed requests for annual rate increases with the mpsc and kcc and gmo filed requests for annual rate increases with the mpsc  with new rates expected to be effective in the third quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
competition missouri and kansas continue on the fully integrated utility model and no legislation authorizing retail choice has been introduced in missouri or kansas for several years 
as a result  electric utility does not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in its franchised service territory  although other sources of energy can provide alternatives to electric utility customers 
if missouri or kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice  electric utility may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations and may be required to write off certain regulatory assets and liabilities 
electric utility competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for customers in its service territory 
in this regard  electric utility competes with owners of other generating stations and other power suppliers  principally utilities in its region  on the basis of availability and price 
electric utility s wholesale revenues averaged approximately of its total revenues over the last three years 
power supply electric utility has over  mws of generating capacity 
the projected peak summer demand for is  mw 
electric utility expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for the years and with its generation assets  capacity purchases and demand side management and efficiency programs 
as part of kcp l s comprehensive energy plan  electric utility expects to have iatan no 
 a coal fired plant  in service in  which will add approximately mw electric utility s share to electric utility s generating capacity 
kcp l is a member of the spp 
spp is a regional transmission organization rto mandated by ferc to ensure reliable supply of power  adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale prices of electricity 
as a member of the spp  kcp l is required to maintain a capacity margin of at least of its projected peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through its generation assets and capacity  power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs 
the capacity margin is designed to ensure the reliability of electric energy in the spp region in the event of operational failure of power generating units utilized by the members of the spp 
fuel the principal fuel sources for electric utility s electric generation are coal and nuclear fuel 
it is expected  with normal weather  that approximately of generation will come from these sources with the remainder provided by wind  natural gas and oil 
the actual and estimated fuel mix and delivered cost in cents per net kwh generated are in the following table 
fuel cost in cents per fuel mix a net kwh generated estimated actual estimated actual fuel coal nuclear coal and natural gas natural gas and oil wind total generation a fuel mix based on percent of total mwhs generated 
gmo s retail rates and kcp l s retail rates in kansas contain certain fuel recovery mechanisms 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a fuel recovery mechanism 
to the extent the price of fuel or purchased power increases significantly  or if electric utility s lower cost units do not meet anticipated availability levels  great plains energy s net income may be adversely affected unless and until the increased cost could be reflected in kcp l s missouri retail rates 
additionally  gmo s retail rates and kcp l s retail rates in missouri reflect a set level of non firm wholesale electric sales margin 
kcp l and gmo will not recover any shortfall in non firm wholesale electric sales margin and for kcp l  any amount of margin above the level reflected in missouri retail rates will be returned to kcp l missouri retail customers in a future rate case 
coal during  electric utility s generating units  including jointly owned units  are projected to burn approximately million tons of coal 
kcp l and gmo have entered into coal purchase contracts with various suppliers in wyoming s powder river basin prb  the nation s principal supply region of low sulfur coal  and with local suppliers 
the coal to be provided under these contracts will satisfy almost all of the projected coal requirements for and approximately for  for and for each of and the remainder of the coal requirements will be fulfilled through additional contracts or spot market purchases 
kcp l and gmo have entered into coal contracts over time at higher average prices affecting coal costs for and beyond 
kcp l and gmo have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the prb to their generating units 
the transportation services to be provided under these contracts will satisfy approximately of the projected requirements for and approximately for the majority of kcp l s and gmo s rail transportation contracts expire in kcp l and gmo will pay tariff rates after  which are typically higher 
coal transportation costs are expected to increase in and beyond 
nuclear fuel kcp l owns of wolf creek nuclear operating corporation wcnoc  the operating company for wolf creek  which is electric utility s only nuclear generating unit 
wolf creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor 
this process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies 
the owners of wolf creek have on hand or under contract all of the uranium and conversion services needed to operate wolf creek through march and approximately after that date through september the owners also have under contract of the uranium enrichment and fabrication required to operate wolf creek through march management expects its cost of nuclear fuel to remain relatively stable through because of contracts in place 
management anticipates the cost of nuclear fuel to increase significantly in  after which increases are expected to be moderate 
even with this anticipated increase  management expects nuclear fuel cost per mwh generated to remain less than the cost of generation from other fuel sources 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding nuclear plant 
natural gas at december   kcp l had hedged approximately and of its and  respectively  projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
at december   gmo had hedged approximately and of its and  respectively  expected on peak natural gas usage and natural gas equivalent purchased power 
purchased capacity and power kcp l and gmo have distinct rate and dispatching areas 
as a result  kcp l and gmo do not joint dispatch their respective generation  resulting in gmo purchasing capacity and power to meet its customers needs 
gmo has long term purchased capacity and power agreements for approximately mw 
at times  kcp l purchases power to meet its customers needs when it does not have sufficient available generation or when the cost of purchased power is less than kcp l s cost of generation or to satisfy firm power commitments 
management believes electric utility will be able to obtain enough power to meet its future demands due to the coordination of planning and operations in the spp region  however  price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand 
electric utility s purchased power  as a percent of mwh requirements  averaged approximately  and for  and  respectively 
since the july   acquisition of gmo  electric utility s purchased power  as a percentage of mwh requirements  averaged approximately 
environmental matters see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters 
kansas city power light company kcp l  headquartered in kansas city  missouri  is an integrated  regulated electric utility that engages in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity 
kcp l serves approximately  customers located in western missouri and eastern kansas 
customers include approximately  residences   commercial firms  and  industrials  municipalities and other electric utilities 
kcp l s retail revenues averaged approximately of its total operating revenues over the last three years 
wholesale firm power  bulk power sales and miscellaneous electric revenues accounted for the remainder of kcp l s revenues 
kcp l is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter

item a 
risk factors actual results in future periods for great plains energy and kcp l could differ materially from historical results and the forward looking statements contained in this report 
the companies business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict  involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond the companies control 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the companies management currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the companies 
this information  as well as the other information included in this report and in the other documents filed with the sec  should be carefully considered before making an investment in the securities of great plains energy and kcp l 
risk factors of kcp l and gmo are also risk factors of great plains energy 
regulatory and environmental risks complex utility and environmental regulation could adversely affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
kcp l and gmo are subject to  or affected by  extensive federal and state utility regulation  including by the mpsc  kcc  ferc  nrc  spp and nerc 
they must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations 
in the company s business planning and management of operations  it must address the effects of existing and proposed regulation on its businesses and changes in the regulatory framework  including initiatives by federal and state legislatures  regional transmission organizations  utility regulators and taxing authorities 
failure of kcp l or gmo to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner  adoption of new regulations by federal or state agencies  or changes to current regulations and interpretations of such regulations may materially affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the outcome of retail rate proceedings could have a material impact on the business and is largely outside the company s control 
the rates that kcp l and gmo are allowed to charge their customers are the single most important item influencing their results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
these rates are subject to the determination  in large part  of governmental entities outside of kcp l s and gmo s control  including the mpsc  kcc for kcp l and ferc 
kcp l and gmo are also exposed to cost recovery shortfalls due to the inherent lag in the rate setting process  especially during periods of significant cost inflation  as utility rates in missouri and kansas are set on the basis of historical costs and are not subject to adjustment other than for fuel and purchased power for kcp l in kansas and gmo between rate cases 
as a part of the missouri and kansas stipulations approved by the mpsc and kcc in  kcp l began implementation of its comprehensive energy plan 
under the comprehensive energy plan  kcp l agreed to undertake certain projects  including iatan no 
 installing a new wind powered generating facility  installing environmental upgrades to certain existing plants  infrastructure improvements and demand management  distributed generation  and customer efficiency and affordability programs 
in march  kcp l entered into a collaboration agreement with the sierra club and concerned citizens of platte county that provides for increases in kcp l s wind generation capacity and energy efficiency initiatives  reductions in certain emission permit levels at its iatan and lacygne generating stations  and projects to offset certain carbon dioxide emissions 
the wind generation  energy efficiency and emission permit reductions are conditioned on regulatory approval 
a reduction or rejection by the mpsc or kcc of rate increase requests reflecting the costs of projects under the comprehensive energy plan or collaboration agreement  or other costs and expenses  could lead to lowered credit ratings  reduced access to capital markets  increased financing costs  lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements  which could materially and adversely affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
in response to competitive  economic  political  legislative and regulatory pressures  kcp l and gmo may be subject to rate moratoriums  rate refunds and limits on rate increases or rate reductions  including phase in plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period of time for the benefit of customers 
any or all of these could have a significant adverse effect on great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
regulatory requirements regarding utility operations may increase costs and may expose kcp l and gmo to compliance penalties 
the mpsc and kcc have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements  such as vegetation management standards  facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards 
kcp l agreed to quality of service standards in kansas in connection with the gmo acquisition 
the costs of new or modified operational standards and requirements could have an adverse effect on great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows as a result of increased operations or maintenance and capital expenditures for new facilities or to repair or improve existing facilities 
failure to meet quality of service  operational or other standards and requirements could expose kcp l or gmo to penalties or other adverse rate consequences 
the company is subject to current and potential environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities  any or all of which may adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
the company is subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities with regard to air quality and other environmental matters  through kcp l s and gmo s operations 
the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity produces and requires proper management and disposal of certain hazardous products and wastes  which are subject to these laws and regulations 
in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations  these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance  including fines  injunctive relief and other sanctions 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
there is also a risk that new environmental laws and regulations  and new judicial interpretations of environmental laws and regulations  could adversely affect kcp l s and gmo s operations 
in particular  various stakeholders  including legislators  regulators  shareholders and non governmental organizations  as well as utilities and other companies in many business sectors  are considering ways to address climate change  including through the regulation of co and other greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to encourage or mandate the use of renewable resources  energy efficiency and demand response management 
in november  missouri voters approved an initiative that requires at least of electricity to come from renewable resources by  increasing to by the governor of kansas supports mandatory renewable energy portfolio standards  and bills that would establish such standards have been introduced in the kansas legislature 
the kansas department of health and environment kdhe has indicated that it intends to engage industries and stakeholders to establish goals and strategies for reducing co emissions 
additional federal and or state legislation or regulation to release greenhouse gas emissions may be enacted in the near future 
further  pursuant to the collaboration agreement  kcp l agreed to pursue a set of initiatives including energy efficiency  additional wind generation  lower emission permit levels at its iatan and lacygne stations and other initiatives designed to offset co emissions 
kcp l s current generation capacity is primarily coal fired and is estimated to produce about one ton of co per mwh  or approximately million tons per year 
gmo s current generation capacity also is primarily coal fired and is estimated to produce approximately million tons of co per year 
requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may cause kcp l and gmo to incur significant costs relating to their ongoing operations through additional environmental control equipment  retiring and replacing existing generation  or selecting more costly generation alternatives  to procure emission allowance credits  or due to the imposition of taxes  fees or other governmental charges as a result of such emissions 
rules issued by the environmental protection agency epa regarding emissions of mercury  nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides are also in a state of flux 
such rules have been overturned by the courts and remanded to the epa to be revised consistent with the court orders 
it is unclear what standards will be imposed in the future  when kcp l and gmo may have to comply with any new standards or what costs may ultimately be required to comply with such standards 
new facilities  or modifications of existing facilities  may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits 
delays in the environmental permitting process  denials of permit applications  conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially affect the cost and timing of the environmental retrofit projects included in the comprehensive energy plan  among other projects  and thus materially affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
under current law  kcp l and gmo are also generally responsible for any liabilities associated with the environmental condition of their properties  including properties that they have previously owned or operated  such as manufactured gas plants mgp  regardless of whether they were responsible for the contamination or whether the liabilities arose before  during or after the time they owned or operated the properties 
kcp l and gmo may not be allowed by the mpsc or kcc to recover all of their costs for environmental expenditures through rates in the future 
the incurrence of material environmental costs or liabilities  without related rate recovery  could have a material adverse effect on great plains energy s or kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters 
the federal clean air act requires companies to obtain permits and  if necessary  install control equipment to reduce emissions when making a major modification or a change in operation of an existing facility if either is expected to cause a significant net increase in regulated emissions 
in  the epa notified westar energy  inc westar that certain projects completed at the jeffrey energy center violated certain new source review permitting requirements 
gmo is an owner of the facility  which is operated by westar  and is generally responsible for its share of the facility s operating costs and capital expenditures 
on february   the attorney general of the united states filed a complaint against westar alleging that it violated the clean air act and related federal and state regulations by making major modifications to the jeffrey energy center beginning in without first obtaining appropriate permits authorizing this construction and without installing and operating best available control technology to control emissions 
resolution of this matter potentially could involve the installation and operation of new emission control systems at jeffrey energy center  surrender of emission allowances  interruptions or shut down of operations at the jeffrey energy center  applications for new or modified permits  audits of jeffrey energy center operations  actions to otherwise mitigate any resulting harm to public health and the environment  and assessment of a civil penalty of up to  per day for each violation 
gmo s portion of such costs could be significant 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined  nor can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome presently be reasonably estimated 
there is no assurance these costs  if any  could be recovered in rates  and any failure to recover such costs could have a significant effect on great plains energy s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in  kcp l received a subpoena from a federal grand jury seeking documents relating to capital projects at iatan no 
kcp l expects to complete the delivery of responsive documents by early march kcp l believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all relevant laws and regulations  however  the ultimate outcome of these grand jury activities or possible civil or administrative proceedings regarding capital projects at iatan no 
and other coal units cannot presently be determined  nor can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome presently be reasonably estimated 
there is no assurance these costs  if any  could be recovered in rates  and any failure to recover such costs could have a significant effect on great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
due to all of the above  kcp l s and gmo s projected capital and other expenditures for environmental compliance are subject to significant uncertainties  including the timing of implementation of any new or modified environmental requirements  the emissions limits imposed by such requirements and the types and costs of the compliance alternatives selected by kcp l and gmo 
as a result  costs to comply with environmental requirements cannot be estimated with certainty  and actual costs could be significantly higher than projections 
other new environmental laws and regulations affecting the operations of kcp l and gmo may be adopted  and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to kcp l and gmo or their facilities  any of which may adversely affect great plains energy s and kcp l s business and substantially increase their environmental expenditures or liabilities in the future 
financial risks financial market disruptions and declines in the credit ratings of great plains energy  kcp l or gmo may increase financing costs and or limit access to the credit markets  which may adversely affect liquidity and results 
kcp l s capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years 
the acquisition of gmo has further increased the company s overall capital requirements  and the capital requirements of gmo over the next several years are expected to be substantial as it implements generation and environmental projects 
the company relies on access to short term money markets  revolving credit facilities provided by financial institutions and long term capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations 
the company also relies on bank provided credit facilities for credit support  such as letters of credit  to support operations 
the amount of credit support required for kcp l and gmo operations varies with a number of factors  including the amount and price of wholesale power purchased or sold 
great plains energy  kcp l  gmo and certain of their securities are rated by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
these ratings impact the companies cost of funds and great plains energy s ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 
the interest rates on borrowings under kcp l s revolving credit agreement and on a substantial portion of great plains energy s and gmo s debt are subject to increase as their respective credit ratings decrease 
the company has agreed to not seek rate recovery of gmo interest costs in excess of equivalent investment grade debt  and the mpsc approval of the gmo acquisition is conditioned on the requirement that any post acquisition financial effects of a credit downgrade of great plains energy  kcp l or gmo occurring as a result of the acquisition would be borne by shareholders and not utility customers 
the amount of collateral or other credit support required under power supply agreements is also dependent on credit ratings 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  or if there is a decrease in great plains energy s  kcp l s or gmo s credit ratings  there can be no assurance that the companies would not experience an adverse effect on their access to capital and cost of funds  dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices  increases in the amount of collateral or other credit support obligations required to be posted with contractual counterparties  increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other post retirement benefit plan funding requirements  issuance of secured rather than unsecured debt  rate case disallowance of kcp l s or gmo s costs of capital  or reductions in great plains energy s ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 
any of these results could adversely affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on great plains energy s  kcp l s or gmo s lenders  suppliers and other counterparties or on kcp l s  gmo s  including mps merchant  customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations 
a sustained decline in great plains energy s stock price below book value may result in goodwill impairments that could adversely affect great plains energy s results of operations and financial position  as well as credit facility covenants 
the gmo acquisition resulted in great plains energy recording approximately million in goodwill 
accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating that it is possible that an impairment exists 
the company s annual impairment testing is conducted in september 
subsequent to september  financial market disruptions and volatility have resulted in great plains energy s stock trading at a price below carrying value 
if the stock price continues to be below carrying value  the accounting rules may require great plains energy to conduct another goodwill impairment test 
there is no assurance that the results of this additional test will not require great plains energy to recognize an impairment of goodwill 
an impairment of gmo acquisition goodwill would reduce net income and may adversely affect great plains energy s results of operations and financial position  and could result in a breach of the debt to total capitalization covenants in great plains energy s and gmo s revolving credit agreements 
great plains energy has guaranteed substantially all of the outstanding debt of gmo and payments under these guarantees may adversely affect great plains energy s liquidity 
in connection with the gmo acquisition  great plains energy issued guarantees covering substantially all of the outstanding debt of gmo and has guaranteed a million revolving credit facility that was entered into by gmo subsequent to the acquisition 
the guarantees were a factor in gmo receiving investment grade ratings and the guarantees obligate great plains energy directly to pay amounts owed by gmo to the holders of the guaranteed debt in the event gmo defaults on its payment obligations 
any guarantee payments could adversely affect great plains energy s liquidity 
the inability of great plains energy s subsidiaries to provide sufficient dividends to allow great plains energy to pay dividends to its shareholders and meet its financial obligations would have an adverse effect 
great plains energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own 
the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries  particularly kcp l and gmo 
kcp l has committed to state regulatory commissions to maintain a equity to total capitalization ratio  and great plains energy  kcp l and gmo have similar covenants in their revolving credit facilities 
in addition  under federal law  kcp l and gmo may pay dividends generally only out of retained earnings 
the ability of great plains energy s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions  and accordingly  great plains energy s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations principally depends on the actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries  as well as on regulatory factors  financial covenants  general business conditions and other matters 
market performance  increased retirements and changes in retirement plan regulations could significantly impact retirement plan funding requirements and associated cash needs and expenses 
substantially all of kcp l s employees participate in defined benefit and post retirement plans 
gmo s former employees in its missouri utility operations and certain other operations have accrued benefits in gmo s defined benefit and post retirement plans 
if kcp l employees retire when they become eligible for retirement through  or if these plans experience adverse market returns on investments as has been the case during the period  or if interest rates materially fall  kcp l and gmo contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels 
in addition  assumptions related to future costs  returns on investments  interest rates and other actuarial assumptions  including projected retirements  have a significant impact on great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the pension protection act of ppa alters the manner in which pension plan assets and liabilities are valued for purposes of calculating required pension contributions and changes the timing of required contributions to underfunded plans 
the funding rules  which became effective in  could significantly affect the company s funding requirements 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb has a project to reconsider the accounting for expense recognition related to pensions and other post retirement benefits  which may result in accelerated expense 
the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business could result in losses that could negatively impact great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
great plains energy  kcp l  gmo  including mps merchant  use derivative instruments  such as swaps  options  futures and forwards  to manage commodity and financial risks 
losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts  if a counterparty fails to perform  or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
as a service provider to gmo  kcp l may have exposure to gmo s financial performance and operations 
gmo has no employees of its own 
kcp l employees operate and manage gmo s properties  and kcp l charges gmo for the cost of these services 
these arrangements may pose risks to kcp l  including possible claims arising from actions of kcp l employees in operating gmo s properties and providing other services to gmo 
kcp l s claims for reimbursement for services provided to gmo are unsecured and rank equally with other unsecured obligations of gmo 
kcp l s ability to be reimbursed for the costs incurred for the benefit of gmo depends on the financial ability of gmo to make such payments 
customer and weather related risks severe weather and changes in customer demand due to sustained financial market disruptions  downturns or sluggishness in the economy  weather conditions or otherwise may adversely affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of great plains energy and kcp l can be materially affected by changes in weather and customer demand 
kcp l and gmo estimate customer demand based on historical trends to procure fuel and purchased power 
sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which kcp l and gmo operate 
kcp l s electricity sales volume declined in compared to  and retail demand for kcp l and gmo is expected to be lower in than it was in assuming normal weather conditions 
if the current financial market disruptions or economic downturn continue or worsen  overall electricity sales volumes may further decline and or bad debt expense may increase  which could materially affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities 
kcp l and gmo are significantly impacted by seasonality  with approximately one third of their retail electric revenues recorded in the third quarter 
unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales 
in addition  severe weather  including but not limited to tornados  snow  rain and ice storms can be destructive causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses and lower revenues 
some of kcp l s and gmo s stations use water from the missouri river for cooling purposes 
low water and flow levels  which have been experienced in recent years  can increase maintenance costs at these stations and  if these levels were to get low enough  could cause modifications to plant operations 
integration and operational risks only a portion of the costs associated with the gmo acquisition will be recovered through utility rates  and the expected cost benefits of the gmo transaction may not be realized  which could adversely affect great plains energy s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the mpsc order approving the gmo transaction provides that the transaction costs will not be recovered through utility rates  and that the missouri jurisdictional portion of transition costs estimated to be million at december  will be eligible for recovery through utility rates only to the extent the costs are offset by benefits resulting from the acquisition 
the kcc order approving the gmo transaction limited kcp l s recovery of transition costs through kansas rates to million 
at december   great plains energy had million of regulatory assets related to transition costs  which included million at kcp l and million at gmo 
great plains energy and kcp l expect to achieve various benefits  including cost savings and operating efficiencies in connection with the acquisition 
approximately half of the total estimated cost savings over the first five years following the gmo acquisition are expected to come from reductions in gmo s corporate overhead and other costs that are not being recovered  and are not expected to be recovered  through utility rates 
if these costs are not able to be eliminated as anticipated  great plains energy s results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
the benefits of integrating kcp l s and gmo s utility businesses may be less than expected  which could adversely affect the company s regulatory treatment and results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
great plains energy and kcp l expect to achieve synergies through the ongoing integration of kcp l and gmo utility operations 
this integration poses significant challenges due to the size and complexity of each organization 
the company has dedicated substantial efforts and resources since the gmo acquisition was announced to plan for and implement an efficient and successful integration of utility operations 
great plains energy and kcp l believe that the anticipated benefits will be achieved 
however  there is no assurance that the utility operations integration will be completed successfully or in a timely manner  or result in the anticipated benefits 
failure to achieve the anticipated cost reductions or customer service levels could result in adverse regulatory actions and could negatively affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
operations risks may adversely affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the operation of kcp l s and gmo s electric generation  transmission and distribution systems involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  processes and personnel performance  problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages  operating limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions  environmental  safety or other regulatory requirements  fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions  transmission scheduling constraints  and catastrophic events such as fires  explosions  severe weather or other similar occurrences 
an equipment outage or constraint can in the case of generation equipment  directly affect operating costs  increase capital needs and costs  increase purchased power needs and costs and reduce wholesale sales opportunities  in the case of transmission equipment  affect operating costs  increase capital needs and costs  require changes in the source of generation and affect wholesale sales opportunities  and in the case of distribution systems  affect revenues and operating costs  increase capital needs and costs  and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics and customer expectations 
with the exception of hawthorn no 
 which was substantially rebuilt in  all of kcp l s coal fired generating units and its nuclear generating unit were constructed prior to all of gmo s coal fired generating units were constructed prior to the age of these generating units increases the risk of unplanned outages and higher maintenance expense 
training  preventive maintenance and other programs have been implemented  but there is no assurance that these programs will prevent or minimize future breakdowns or failures of kcp l s or gmo s generation facilities 
kcp l and gmo currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover their facilities in amounts that management considers appropriate 
these policies  however  do not cover kcp l s or gmo s transmission or distribution systems  and the cost of repairing damage to these systems may adversely affect great plains energy s or kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and generally do not include business interruption coverage 
insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms  and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of  or any damage to  any of kcp l s or gmo s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage 
these and other operating events may reduce great plains energy s and kcp l s revenues  increase their costs  or both  and may materially affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the cost and schedule of construction projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved 
kcp l s and gmo s businesses are capital intensive  and require significant capital investments to maintain existing facilities  for projected environmental projects and to add new facilities  including iatan no 
 an estimated mw of which electric utility s share is mw coal fired generating plant 
the acquisition of gmo by great plains energy increases great plains energy s exposure to the risks associated with the ongoing iatan construction project 
the risks of any construction project include the possibilities that actual costs may exceed current estimates  delays may occur in obtaining permits and materials  suppliers and contractors may not perform as required under their contracts  there may be inadequate availability or increased cost of qualified craft labor  the scope and timing of projects may change  and that other events beyond kcp l s or gmo s control may occur that may materially affect the schedule  cost and performance of these projects 
the demand for additional environmental control equipment has increased substantially with many utilities in the united states starting similar projects to address changing environmental regulations 
this demand has constrained labor and material resources for such projects  and there is a risk that such constraints may increase if new laws or regulations  including limitations on greenhouse gas emissions  are imposed 
these and other risks could materially increase the estimated costs of construction projects  delay the in service dates of projects  adversely affect the performance of the projects  and or require kcp l or gmo to purchase additional electricity to supply their respective retail customers until the projects are completed 
kcp l and gmo are not permitted to start recovering the costs of these projects until they are completed and put into service 
thus  these risks may significantly affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
failure of one or more generation plant co owners to pay their share of construction  operations and maintenance costs could increase great plains energy s and kcp l s costs and capital requirements 
kcp l owns of wolf creek  of lacygne station  of iatan no 
and of iatan no 
gmo owns of both iatan units and of jeffrey energy center 
the remaining portions of these facilities are owned by other utilities that are contractually obligated to pay their proportionate share of capital and other costs and  in the case of iatan no 
 construction costs 
while the ownership agreements provide that a defaulting co owner s share of the electricity generated can be sold by the non defaulting co owners  there is no assurance that the revenues received will recover the increased costs borne by the non defaulting co owners 
the iatan no 
co owners have provided financial assurances related to their respective construction cost obligations  but there is a risk that such assurances may not be sufficient in the event of a co owner default 
during the construction period  the iatan no 
agreements provide for re allocations of part or all of a defaulting co owner s share of the facility to the non defaulting owners  which would increase the capital requirements  operations and maintenance costs of the non defaulting owners 
occurrence of these or other events could materially increase great plains energy s and kcp l s costs and capital requirements 
an aging workforce and increasing demand for skilled craft labor poses operational and planning challenges 
through  approximately of kcp l employees who manage both kcp l and gmo operations will be eligible to retire with full pension benefits 
this is a general industry issue  which has increased the demand for and cost of skilled craft labor for both companies and contractors 
kcp l and gmo use contractors for a substantial portion of their construction and maintenance work 
failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees  including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees  or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate great plains energy s and kcp l s businesses 
commodity price risks changes in commodity prices could have an adverse effect on great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
kcp l and gmo engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and are exposed to risks associated with the price of electricity 
kcp l and gmo generate  purchase and sell electricity in the retail and wholesale markets 
to the extent that exposure to the price of electricity is not successfully hedged  great plains energy and kcp l could experience losses associated with the changing market price for electricity 
increases in fuel  fuel transportation and purchased power prices could have an adverse impact on great plains energy s and kcp l s costs 
kcp l s kansas retail rates contain an energy cost adjustment eca mechanism 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a similar provision 
gmo s retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause mechanism under which of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of fuel and purchased power costs provided in base rates is passed along to gmo s customers 
gmo s steam rates contain a quarterly cost adjustment under which of the difference between actual fuel costs and base fuel costs is passed along to gmo s steam customers 
as a result  kcp l and gmo are exposed to varying degrees of risk from changes in the market prices of coal  natural gas  nuclear fuel and purchased power 
changes in kcp l s or gmo s fuel mix due to electricity demand  plant availability  transportation issues  fuel prices  fuel availability and other factors can also adversely affect kcp l s or gmo s fuel and purchased power costs 
kcp l and gmo do not hedge their respective entire exposure from fuel and transportation price volatility 
forward prices for coal have increased  principally due to international demand  and management expects prices will continue to increase 
the majority of kcp l s and gmo s rail transportation contracts expire in kcp l and gmo will pay tariff rates after  which are typically higher 
management also expects the cost of nuclear fuel to increase significantly in consequently  great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows may be materially impacted by changes in these prices until increased costs are recovered in missouri retail rates 
wholesale electricity sales affect revenues  creating earnings volatility 
the levels of kcp l and gmo wholesale sales depend on the wholesale market price  transmission availability and the availability of generation for wholesale sales  among other factors 
a substantial portion of wholesale sales are made in the spot market  and thus kcp l and gmo have immediate exposure to wholesale price changes 
wholesale power prices can be volatile and generally increase in times of high regional demand and high natural gas prices 
while an allocated portion of wholesale sales are reflected in kcp l s kansas eca  gmo s and kcp l s missouri rates are set on an estimated amount of wholesale sales 
kcp l and gmo will not recover any shortfall in non firm wholesale electric sales margin and for kcp l  any amount above the level reflected in missouri retail rates will be returned to missouri retail customers in a future rate case 
declines in wholesale market price or availability of generation or transmission constraints in the wholesale markets could reduce kcp l s and gmo s wholesale sales 
these events could adversely affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
kcp l is exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit  which could result in an adverse effect on great plains energy s and kcp l s business and financial results 
kcp l owns of wolf creek 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities  including wolf creek 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  shut down the facilities  or both  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
any revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could result in substantial capital expenditures at wolf creek 
wolf creek has the lowest fuel cost per mwh of any of kcp l s generating units 
an extended outage of wolf creek  whether resulting from nrc action  an incident at the plant or otherwise  could have a substantial adverse effect on kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the event kcp l incurs higher replacement power and other costs that are not recovered through rates 
if a long term outage occurred  the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base 
ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit exposes kcp l to risks regarding decommissioning costs at the end of the unit s life 
kcp l contributes annually to a tax qualified trust fund to be used to decommission wolf creek 
the funding level assumes a projected level of return on trust assets 
if the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level  kcp l could be responsible for the balance of funds required  however  should this happen  management believes a rate increase would be allowed ensuring full recovery of decommissioning costs over the remaining life of the unit 
kcp l is also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit  including  but not limited to  potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit and the storage  handling and disposal of radioactive materials  and to potential retrospective assessments and losses in excess of insurance coverage 
any such risks could adversely affect great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
litigation risks the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted 
an adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on great plains energy s and kcp l s financial condition 
great plains energy  kcp l and gmo are party to various material litigation and regulatory matters arising out of their business operations 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined  nor  in many cases  can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case presently be reasonably estimated 
the liability that great plains energy  kcp l and gmo may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters and  as a result  these matters may have a material adverse effect on great plains energy s and kcp l s results of operations  financial position and cash flows

has been off line for a scheduled outage since mid october for a unit overhaul and to tie in the environmental equipment 
iatan no 
was originally scheduled to be back on line in february  but  during start up  a high level of vibration was experienced 
repairs to the turbine could delay the in service date of iatan no 
 by up to two months 
management believes that a delay of that duration could still be accommodated in the current kcp l and gmo rate cases  however  there could be a corresponding delay in the effective date of the mpsc rate orders from the current august   date

outlook in  electric utility is expected to have lower retail demand than in as a result of the slowing economy assuming normal weather conditions 
if the current economic downturn continues or worsens  overall electricity mwh sales may continue to decline and or bad debt expense may increase  which could materially affect great plains energy s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
electric utility s retail rates for gmo and in kansas for kcp l are covered by fuel recovery mechanisms  which are described under the heading electric utility results of operations 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not include a fuel recovery mechanism  meaning changes in costs will not be reflected in rates until new rates are authorized by regulators 
this regulatory lag between the time costs change and when they are reflected in rates applies to all costs  other than those included in fuel recovery mechanisms 
in the current rising cost environment  regulatory lag can be expected to have an adverse impact on great plains energy s results of operations 
additionally  continuing instability in the capital and credit markets have adversely affected  and could continue to adversely affect  great plains energy s access to and cost of capital 
in response to these trends  management has taken the following measures eliminated or deferred capital spending in and  tightly managing operations and maintenance expense  freezing external hiring for all but essential skills and reduced the common stock dividend by  from an annual level of per share to per share

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on great plains energy s results of operations and financial position 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of great plains energy s results of operations and financial position 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pensions great plains energy and kcp l incur significant costs in providing non contributory defined pension benefits 
the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 
pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  life expectancies  compensation levels and employment periods  earnings on plan assets  the level of contributions made to the plan  and plan amendments 
in addition  pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted average of long term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan 
the assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation 
these assumptions  updated annually at the measurement date  are based on management s best estimates and judgment  however  material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a increase or a decrease in key actuarial assumptions 
each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only 
impact on impact on projected change in benefit pension actuarial assumption assumption obligation expense millions discount rate increase rate of return on plan assets increase discount rate decrease rate of return on plan assets decrease pension expense for kcp l is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the mpsc and kcc 
the orders allow the difference between pension costs under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds  as appropriate 
kcp l recorded pension expense of million after allocations to the other joint owners of generating facilities and capitalized amounts in accordance with the mpsc and kcc rate orders 
gmo records pension expense in accordance with rate orders from the mpsc 
the difference between this expense and sfas no 
expense is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the accounting for pensions 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan 
it is difficult to predict future pension costs  changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to volatile market conditions 
regulatory matters electric utility is subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
accordingly  great plains energy and kcp l have recorded assets and liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process  which would not otherwise be recorded under gaap 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts imposed by rate actions of electric utility s regulators that may require refunds to customers  amounts provided in current rates that are intended to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future for which electric utility remains accountable  or a gain or other reduction of allowable costs to be given to customers over future periods 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
future reductions in revenue or refunds for regulatory liabilities generally are not mandated  pending future rate proceedings or actions by the regulators 
management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the mpsc  kcc or ferc on electric utility s rate case filings  decisions in other regulatory proceedings  including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to electric utility  and changes in laws and regulations 
if recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations 
electric utility s continued ability to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry 
in the event that sfas no 
no longer applied to a deregulated portion of electric utility s operations  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
additionally  these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets as determined pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
impairments of assets  intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under sfas no 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist as prescribed under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill must be compared with its carrying value to determine the amount of impairment 
great plains energy allocates goodwill from the gmo acquisition to kcp l and gmo reporting units for impairment testing based upon the percentage of synergies expected from each reporting unit 
impairment analyses require management to make assumptions about future sales  operating costs and discount rates over the life of the related asset  or in some cases over an indefinite life 
potential impairment indicators include such factors as current period losses combined with a history of losses  or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market price of the asset under review 
management s assumptions about these factors require significant judgment and under different assumptions  the fair value of an asset could be materially different 
accounting standards require a company to recognize an impairment in the current period results of operations if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from the company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the impairment recognized is the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
during the fourth quarter of  extraordinary levels of volatility and disruption in the stock market resulted in great plains energy s equity securities trading at a stock price below carrying value 
management concluded that the fair value of the company supported the gmo acquisition goodwill 
however  there can be no assurance that continued market volatility with declines of extended duration and severity will not trigger impairment testing in the future  which could result in an impairment of goodwill prospectively 
derivative accounting mps merchant s long term natural gas contracts that qualify as derivatives under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities  are recorded under the mark to market method of accounting 
mps merchant s portfolio consists of natural gas contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of mps merchant s portfolio are management s best estimates utilizing information such as closing exchange rates  over the counter quotes  historical volatility and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable amount of time under current market conditions 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
as a result  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
the fair value of these derivative contracts are recorded as current or long term derivative assets or liabilities 
changes in market prices will affect the recorded fair value of contracts 
natural gas market prices vary based upon a number of factors 
changes in the fair value of contracts will affect earnings in the period of the change for contracts under fair value accounting  while changes in forward market prices related to contracts under accrual accounting will affect earnings in future periods to the extent those prices are realized 
derivative liabilities are discounted using the company s credit standing  versus the receivable side of these transactions  which are discounted based on the counterparties credit standings 
as these spreads narrow  non cash mark to market losses are recorded  as they widen  non cash mark to market gains are recorded 
these gains and losses can fluctuate if the company s credit or the credit of a group of counterparties deteriorates or improves significantly 
management cannot predict whether  or to what extent  the factors affecting market prices may change  but those changes could be material and could be either favorable or unfavorable 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset liability approach in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property 
deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating loss  capital loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
this process requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
the company records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
additionally  the company establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions based upon management s judgment regarding potential future challenges to those positions in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in interest expense and penalties are recognized as a non operating expense 
the accounting estimates related to the liability for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits  the impact of the position is recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
these estimates are updated at each reporting date based on the facts  circumstances and information available 
management is also required to assess at each reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months

electric utility s net income decreased million in compared to this decrease was primarily due to mild summer weather  a decrease in wholesale sales  higher fuel costs  higher purchased power prices and planned and unplanned plant outages which led to increased operating expenses at kcp l 
also  in  kcp l received authorization from the mpsc and kcc to defer million of skill set realignment costs incurred in resulting in lower expenses in partially offsetting these decreases were increased retail revenues primarily due to new retail rates at kcp l effective january  and an increase in afudc at kcp l 
the acquisition of gmo increased electric utility s net income million 
great plains energy s corporate and other activities loss from continuing operations decreased million in compared to  primarily due to million of after tax income related to the release of a legal reserve described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the reversal of million of after tax interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits  a million after tax favorable impact from the deferral in of merger transition costs incurred in to a regulatory asset and a million after tax change in the fair value of forward starting swaps fss 
the acquisition of gmo increased great plains energy s corporate and other activities loss million 
compared to great plains energy s earnings available for common shareholders increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share in a higher number of common shares  primarily due to the issuance of million shares to the holders of feline pridessm in february and million shares in may  diluted earnings per share by 
electric utility s net income increased million in compared to due to increased retail and wholesale revenues  which more than offset the impact of planned and unplanned outages during the first half of the year that lead to increased fuel  purchased power and operating expenses 
additionally  in kcp l recorded million of skill set realignment costs and in received authorization from the mpsc and kcc to defer million of these costs to be amortized in future years 
great plains energy s corporate and other activities recognized an additional million net loss in compared to  which was primarily attributable to a decline in available tax credits from affordable housing investments and overall higher expenses at the holding company  including million of transition costs related to the anticipated acquisition of gmo  and a million after tax loss for the fair value of fss entered into by great plains energy during electric utility results of operations the following table summarizes the electric utility segment results of operations 
millions operating revenues fuel purchased power other operating expenses skill set realignment deferral costs depreciation and amortization operating income non operating income and expenses interest charges income tax expense net income electric utility s residential customers usage is significantly affected by weather 
bulk power sales  the major component of wholesale sales  vary with system requirements  generating unit and purchased power availability  fuel costs and requirements of other electric systems 
electric utility s revenues contain certain fuel recovery mechanisms as follows kcp l s kansas retail rates effective january   contain an eca tariff 
the eca tariff reflects the projected annual amount of fuel  purchased power  emission allowances  transmission costs and asset based off system sales margin 
these projected amounts are subject to quarterly re forecasts 
any difference between the eca revenue collected and the actual eca amounts for a given year which may be positive or negative is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to kansas retail customers over twelve months beginning april of the succeeding year 
gmo s electric retail rates contain a fac under which of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of fuel and purchased power costs provided in base rates is passed along to gmo s customers 
the fac cycle consists of an accumulation period of six months beginning in june and december 
fac rate approval is requested every six months for a twelve month recovery period 
the fac is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to gmo s electric retail customers 
gmo s steam rates contain a quarterly cost adjustment qca under which of the difference between actual fuel costs and base fuel costs is passed along to gmo s steam customers 
the qca is recorded as an increase to or reduction of other revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to gmo s steam customers 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a similar adjustment mechanism  meaning that changes in costs will not be reflected in rates until new rates are authorized by the mpsc 
this regulatory lag between the time costs change and when they are reflected in rates applies to all costs not included in fuel recovery mechanisms as described above 
in the current rising cost environment  regulatory lag can be expected to have an adverse impact on great plains energy s results of operations 
generation fuel mix can substantially change the fuel cost per mwh generated 
generation fuel mix can be significantly impacted by planned and unplanned plant outages 
nuclear fuel cost per mwh generated is substantially less than the cost of coal per mwh generated  which is significantly lower than the cost of natural gas and oil per mwh generated 
the cost per mwh for purchased power is generally significantly higher than the cost per mwh of coal and nuclear generation 
electric utility continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  its demand side management and efficiency programs  availability and cost of fuel supply and purchased power  and the requirements of other electric systems to provide reliable power economically

new retail rates  effective january   at kcp l also increased retail revenue 
these increases were partially offset by mild summer weather in  with a decrease in cooling degree days 
retail revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to new retail rates effective january   growth in the number of customers and higher usage per customer 
in addition  favorable weather in  with a increase in heating degree days partially offset by a decrease in cooling degree days  contributed to the increase in retail revenue 
the following table provides cooling degree days cdd and heating degree days hdd for the last three years at the kansas city international airport 
cdd and hdd are used to reflect the demand for energy to cool or heat homes and buildings

wolf creek s latest refueling outage began on march   and there were several increases in work scope during the outage that extended the restart until may  a primary driver of the work scope increases was modifications to piping systems associated with the emergency core cooling systems 
as a result of the outage  the capacity and equivalent availability factor for wolf creek decreased to in compared to for fuel expense increased million in compared to the acquisition of gmo increased fuel expense million 
the remaining increase was at kcp l  primarily due to higher coal and coal transportation costs and less nuclear in the fuel mix  which has a lower cost compared to other fuel types 
these increases were partially offset by decreased mwhs generated by kcp l  primarily due to lower system requirements 
fuel expense increased million in compared to primarily due to higher coal and coal transportation costs and a increase in mwhs generated  excluding wind generation  which has no fuel cost 
this increase was partially offset by changes in the fuel mix with more nuclear and less coal and natural gas in the fuel mix 
purchased power expense increased million in compared to the acquisition of gmo increased purchased power expense million 
the remaining increase at kcp l was primarily due to a increase in the average price per mwh as a result of higher natural gas prices 
additionally  an increase in mwh purchases primarily due to the impact of the wolf creek refueling outage increased purchased power expense 
these increases were partially offset by million in recoveries from a litigation settlement regarding a transformer failure 
purchased power expense increased million in compared to primarily due to a increase in mwh purchases to support increased retail load  the impact of planned and unplanned outages in the first half of and increased purchases for resale to satisfy firm wholesale mwh sales commitments when it was more economical to purchase power rather than delivering mwhs generated at kcp l s plants 
this increase was slightly offset by a decrease in the average price per mwh 
electric utility other operating expenses including utility operating expenses  maintenance  general taxes and other electric utility s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the following the acquisition of gmo increased operating expenses million  increased plant operations and maintenance expenses of million due to plant outages  increased employee related costs of million  increased property taxes of million due to higher assessments and higher mill levies and increased gross receipts tax expense of million due to the increase in revenues 
electric utility s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the following increased pension expenses of million due to the increased level of pension costs in kcp l s rates effective january   increased plant operations and maintenance expenses of million primarily due to planned and unplanned outages in the first half of and the addition of the spearville wind energy facility in the third quarter of  increased transmission expenses of million primarily due to increased transmission usage charges as a result of the increased wholesale mwh sales and higher spp fees  increased gross receipts tax expense of million due to the increase in revenues  increased labor expense of million primarily due to filling open positions  increased equity compensation expense of million and increased property taxes of million primarily due to increases in mill levies 
partially offsetting the increases in other operating expenses was decreased incentive compensation expense of million

great plains energy s receivables  net decreased million due to a million decrease in receivables from joint owners primarily related to comprehensive energy plan projects and a million decrease in receivables from wholesale power sales 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million receivable related to kcp l s series eirr bonds issued in may and a million increase in customer receivables due to new retail rates and higher usage due to colder weather in december great plains energy s fuel inventories increased million at kcp l primarily due to decreased generation resulting from planned and unplanned plant outages and increased coal and coal transportation prices 
great plains energy s construction work in progress increased million at kcp l primarily due to a million increase related to kcp l s comprehensive energy plan  including million related to the construction of iatan no 
and million for environmental upgrades 
great plains energy s regulatory assets increased million at kcp l due to a reduction of plan assets in the pension and post retirement plans as a result of unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption in the stock and credit markets 
as a regulated utility  kcp l expects to recover any pension and post retirement liabilities from ratepayers and  as a result  recorded a regulatory asset to offset losses in plan assets 
great plains energy s accounts payable increased million due to increased payables related to comprehensive energy plan projects  higher purchased power prices and the timing of cash payments 
great plains energy s derivative instruments current liabilities increased million primarily due to a million decline in the fair value of fss that were assigned from great plains energy to kcp l  partially offset by a decrease of million at kcp l related to the settlement of a treasury lock t lock simultaneously with the issuance of million of senior notes in march great plains energy s deferred tax credits increased million due to recognition of million of advanced coal credits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the advanced coal credits 
great plains energy s asset retirement obligations increased million primarily due to kcp l recording million of changes in cost estimates and timing used in computing the present value of certain asbestos asset retirement obligations aros 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
great plains energy s pension and post retirement liability long term increased million due to unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption in the stock and credit markets which resulted in large reductions in the value of plan assets 
great plains energy s regulatory liabilities decreased million at kcp l primarily due to a reclassification to accumulated depreciation  consistent with ratemaking treatment  of the regulatory liability for additional wolf creek amortization missouri of million 
great plains energy s other deferred credits and other liabilities decreased million due to the payment against and release of a legal reserve 
great plains energy s long term debt increased million due to kcp l s issuance of million of senior notes in march and million of series eirr bonds in may capital requirements and liquidity great plains energy operates through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries 
great plains energy s ability to make payments on its debt securities and its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries  proceeds from the issuance of its securities and borrowing under its revolving credit facility 
great plains energy s capital requirements are principally comprised of debt maturities and electric utility s utility construction and other capital expenditures 
these items as well as additional cash and capital requirements are discussed below 
great plains energy s liquid resources at december   consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million of unused bank lines of credit 
the unused lines consisted of million from kcp l s revolving credit facility  million from gmo s credit facilities and million from great plains energy s revolving credit facility 
at february   great plains energy s unused bank lines of credit decreased million from the amount at december   primarily to support expenditures for comprehensive energy plan projects 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these agreements 
great plains energy intends to meet day to day cash flow requirements including interest payments  retirement of maturing debt  construction requirements excluding kcp l s comprehensive energy plan  dividends and pension benefit plan funding requirements  discussed below  with a combination of internally generated funds and proceeds from the issuance of short term and long term debt  equity securities or equity linked securities 
great plains energy s intention to meet a portion of these requirements with internally generated funds may  however  be impacted by the effect of inflation on operating expenses  the level of mwh sales  regulatory actions  compliance with environmental regulations and the availability of generating units 
in addition  great plains energy may issue debt  equity and or equity linked securities to finance growth or take advantage of new opportunities 
kcp l currently expects to fund its comprehensive energy plan from a combination of internal and external sources including  but not limited to  contributions from rate increases  capital contributions to kcp l from great plains energy s security issuances and new short and long term debt financing 
kcp l s primary means of short term financing is the issuance of commercial paper 
commercial paper market conditions were extremely difficult in the late third quarter and early fourth quarter of despite this  kcp l maintained uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market  although at higher rates and shorter terms than historically 
as the fourth quarter progressed  conditions in the commercial paper market improved and kcp l benefited in terms of both longer available terms and lower rates 
in february  great plains energy reduced its annual common dividend from per common share to per common share  which will reduce annual cash requirements for dividend payments by approximately million from the level required if the prior dividend had been maintained 
great plains energy presently believes it has the necessary liquidity to effectively conduct business operations for much of if capital markets were to become inaccessible 
instability in the capital and credit markets such as which occurred in the fourth quarter of  could adversely affect great plains energy s access and cost of needed capital 
cash flows from operating activities great plains energy generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities for great plains energy in compared to reflects an increase in kcp l s cash flows due to a decrease in accounts receivable from wholesale sales and joint owners and tax refunds received in partially offset by payment of million for the settlement of three t locks 
other changes in working capital are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities for great plains energy in compared to reflects an increase in kcp l s cash flows due to higher retail and wholesale revenues more than offsetting higher operating expenses combined with million in proceeds from sales of so emission allowances in this increase was partially offset by a million increase in deferred acquisition costs at great plains energy and a lower retail margin per mwh without the impact of unrealized fair value gains and losses at strategic energy 
other changes in working capital detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements also impacted operating cash flows 
cash flows from investing activities great plains energy s cash used for investing activities varies with the timing of utility capital expenditures and purchases of investments and nonutility property 
investing activities are offset by the proceeds from the sale of properties and insurance recoveries 
great plains energy s utility capital expenditures increased million in compared to the acquisition of gmo increased cash utility capital expenditures million and kcp l s cash utility capital expenditures increased million due to a million increase related to kcp l s comprehensive energy plan

in february  great plains energy exercised its rights to redeem its million feline prides senior notes in full satisfaction of each holder s obligation to purchase the company s common stock under the purchase contracts and issued million shares of common stock to the holders of the feline prides purchase contracts 
in april  great plains energy elected to terminate a forward sale agreement with merrill lynch financial markets  inc for million shares of great plains energy common stock and settle it in cash 
based on the difference between great plains energy s average stock price of over the period used to determine the settlement and the then applicable forward price of  great plains energy paid million to merrill lynch financial markets  inc in  great plains energy entered into three fss  with a total notional amount of million  to hedge against interest rate fluctuations on future issuances of long term debt 
the three fss were designed to effectively remove most of the interest rate uncertainty and  to the extent that swap spreads correlate with credit spreads  some degree of credit spread uncertainty with respect to the debt to be issued  thereby enabling great plains energy to predict with greater assurance its future interest costs on that debt 
following a change in financing plans  great plains energy assigned the three fss to kcp l 
kcp l kcp l has an effective shelf registration statement providing for the sale of up to million of investment grade notes and general mortgage bonds that became effective in january there is currently million of capacity under this registration statement 
in march  kcp l issued million of unsecured senior notes  maturing in kcp l settled three t locks simultaneously with the issuance of its million year long term debt and paid million in cash for the settlement 
in  kcp l remarketed several series of eirr bonds that were auction rate securities  ie the interest rates were periodically reset through an auction process  as follows secured series eirr bonds maturing in totaling million at a fixed rate of through march   secured series a eirr bonds maturing in totaling million at a fixed rate of through march   unsecured series b eirr bonds maturing in totaling million at a fixed rate of through march   secured series b eirr bonds maturing in totaling million at a fixed rate of through march   and unsecured series a eirr bonds maturing in into two series series a totaling million at a fixed rate of through march  and series a totaling million at a fixed rate of through march  after these remarketing activities  none of kcp l s eirr bonds are in auction rate mode 
in may  kcp l s series eirr bonds totaling million maturing in were issued 
proceeds of the bonds will be used to pay for a portion of the costs at the iatan nos

the bonds have an initial long term interest rate of until june  at the end of the initial long term interest rate period  the bonds are subject to mandatory tender  however  kcp l is not obligated to pay the purchase price of the bonds on the mandatory tender date 
if the bonds are not successfully remarketed  the bonds will bear interest at a daily rate equal to per annum until all of the bonds are successfully remarketed 
in  kcp l s series a and b unsecured eirr bonds totaling million maturing in were issued 
the eirr bonds series a and b are covered by a municipal bond insurance policy issued by financial guaranty insurance company fgic 
the insurance agreement between kcp l and fgic provides for reimbursement by kcp l for any amounts that fgic pays under the municipal bond insurance policy 
the insurance policy is in effect for the term of the bonds 
the policy also restricts the amount of secured debt kcp l may issue 
in the event kcp l issues debt secured by liens not permitted by the agreement  kcp l is required to issue and deliver to fgic first mortgage bonds or similar securities equal in principal amount to the principal amount of the eirr bonds series a and b then outstanding 
the proceeds from the issuance of million eirr bonds series a and b were used for the repayment of million of series a  b and d eirr bonds

the company expects to contribute million to the plans in to satisfy the funding requirements of erisa and the mpsc and kcc rate orders  of which the majority will be paid by kcp l 
this doesn t include additional voluntary contributions that may be made to address funding levels affected by recent market declines 
due to the economic downturn  the worker  retiree and employer recovery act wrera was signed into law on december   to provide some funding relief from the requirements of the ppa which was generally effective for plan years beginning in among other things  wrera relaxes the ppa transition rules for phasing in liability targets 
with the gmo acquisition on july   black hills assumed the pension obligation and a portion of the plan assets related to the current and former employees of gmo s electric and gas utility operations acquired by black hills under the terms of the purchase agreement 
the final transfer of plan assets is expected to be completed in the first quarter of at which time the company expects to make a voluntary contribution of approximately million to sustain the funded status of the plans 
management believes the company has adequate access to capital resources through a combination of cash flows from operations and existing lines of credit to support the funding requirements 
credit ratings at december   the major credit rating agencies rated great plains energy s and kcp l s securities as detailed in the following table

wolf creek s latest refueling outage began on march   and there were several increases in work scope during the outage that extended the restart until may  a primary driver of the work scope increases was modifications to piping systems associated with the emergency core cooling systems 
as a result of the outage  the capacity and equivalent availability factor for wolf creek decreased to in  compared to for fuel expense increased million in compared to primarily due to higher coal and coal transportation costs and less nuclear in the fuel mix  which has a lower cost compared to other fuel types 
these increases were partially offset by decreased mwhs generated primarily due to lower system requirements 
fuel expense increased million in compared to primarily due to higher coal and coal transportation costs and a increase in mwhs generated  excluding wind generation  which has no fuel cost 
this increase was partially offset by changes in the fuel mix with more nuclear and less coal and natural gas in the fuel mix 
purchased power expense increased million in compared to primarily due to a increase in the average price per mwh as a result of higher natural gas prices 
additionally  an increase in mwh purchases due to the impact of plant outages in the first half of the year increased purchased power expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  great plains energy and kcp l face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include business  legal  operations and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis 
see item a 
risk factors and item 
md a for further discussion of risk factors 
great plains energy and kcp l are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply  interest rates and equity prices 
management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects the volatility of the markets may have on its operating results 
during the ordinary course of business  under the direction and control of an internal risk management committee  great plains energy s and kcp l s hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
though management believes its risk management practices to be effective  it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk 
great plains energy and kcp l could experience losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position  due to many factors  including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets  from regulatory driven market rule changes and or bankruptcy or non performance of customers or counterparties  and or failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize 
derivative instruments are frequently utilized to execute risk management and hedging strategies 
derivative instruments  such as futures  forward contracts  swaps or options  derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments listed and traded on an exchange 
interest rate risk great plains energy and kcp l manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may also be used to achieve the desired combination 
using outstanding balances and annualized interest rates as of december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rates associated with long term variable rate debt would result in an increase of million in interest expense for additionally  interest rates impact the fair value of long term debt 
a change in interest rates would impact great plains energy and kcp l to the extent they redeemed any of their outstanding long term debt 
great plains energy s and kcp l s book values of long term debt were above fair value by and  respectively  at december  kcp l had million of commercial paper outstanding at december  the principal amount of the commercial paper  which will vary during the year  will drive kcp l s commercial paper interest expense 
assuming that million of commercial paper was outstanding for all of  a hypothetical increase in commercial paper rates would result in an increase of million in interest expense for commodity risk great plains energy and kcp l engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and are exposed to risk associated with the price of electricity 
kcp l s wholesale operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and long  intermediate and short term capacity or power purchase agreements 
the agreements contain penalties for non performance to limit kcp l s energy price risk on the contracted energy 
kcp l also enters into additional power purchase agreements with the objective of obtaining the most economical energy to meet its physical delivery obligations to customers 
kcp l is required to maintain a capacity margin of at least of its peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through its generation assets and capacity and power purchase agreements to protect it from the potential operational failure of one of its power generating units 
kcp l continually evaluates the need for additional risk mitigation measures in order to minimize its financial exposure to  among other things  spikes in wholesale power prices during periods of high demand 
kcp l s sales include the sales of electricity to its retail customers and bulk power sales of electricity in the wholesale market 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply  the availability and cost of purchased power and the requirements of other electric systems  therefore  the impact of the hypothetical amounts that follow could be significantly reduced depending on the system requirements and market prices at the time of the increases 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of power could result in a million decrease in operating income for related to purchased power 
in  approximately of kcp l s net mwhs generated are expected to be coal fired 
kcp l currently has almost all of its coal requirements for under contract 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of coal could result in less than a million increase in fuel expense for kcp l has also implemented price risk mitigation measures to reduce its exposure to high natural gas prices 
a hypothetical increase in natural gas and oil market prices could result in an increase of million in fuel expense for at december   kcp l had hedged approximately and of its and  respectively  projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
at december   kcp l had hedged approximately and of its and  respectively  projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
kcp l s kansas eca allows for the recovery of increased fuel and purchased power costs from kansas retail customers 
in the gmo regulated electric operations in  approximately of the power sold was generated and the remaining was purchased through long term contracts or in the open market 
gmo has a fac that allows it to adjust retail electric rates based on of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of fuel and purchased power costs provided in base rates 
several measures have been taken to mitigate commodity price risk exposure in gmo s electric utility operations 
one of these measures is contracting for a diverse supply of coal to meet and of its and  respectively  native load fuel requirements of coal fired generation 
the price risk associated with natural gas and on peak spot market purchased power requirements is also mitigated through a hedging plan using new york mercantile exchange nymex futures contracts and options 
this is a multi year hedging plan 
as of december   gmo had financial contracts in place to hedge approximately and of expected on peak natural gas and natural gas equivalent purchased power price exposure for and  respectively 
the mark to market value of these contracts at december   was a liability of million 
additional factors that affect commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and scheduled outages at facilities that use fossil fuels 
customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
market risk mps merchant mps merchant is exposed to market risk  including changes in commodity prices 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  mps merchant enters into various derivative transactions in accordance with the risk management policy 
the trading portfolios consist of natural gas contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
these contracts take many forms  including futures  forwards  swaps and options 
although mps merchant maintains a number of transactions which are fully hedged via back to back deals  the business also retains two contractual obligations that are not fully hedged 
mps merchant is exposed to intra month natural gas price volatility  with contracts that have a fixed price set at the beginning of each month at which customers have an option to purchase gas from mps merchant within the month 
customers typically exercise this option when natural gas prices rise  thereby creating an exposure for mps merchant 
a hypothetical increase in the daily price of natural gas  versus the first of month index fom  could result in a million pre tax decrease in mps merchant non operating income in mps merchant manages this risk daily with monthly and daily swaps 
these index based transactions continue through the year transactions carried out in connection with trading activities that are derivatives under sfas no 
are accounted for under the mark to market method of accounting 
under sfas no 
 mps merchant s energy commodity trading contracts  including physical transactions mainly gas and financial instruments  are recorded at fair value 
as part of the valuation of the portfolio  great plains energy values the credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties and the time value of money 
quoted market prices from published sources or comparable transactions in liquid markets are used to value the contracts 
if actively quoted market prices are not available  brokers are contracted or other external sources or comparable transactions are used to obtain current values of the contracts 
in addition  the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of the portfolio are best estimates utilizing information such as historical volatility  time value  counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating the positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  certain contracts are recorded at fair value using an alternative approach such as model pricing 
mps merchant is also exposed to credit risk 
credit risk is measured by the loss that would be recorded if counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of the contractual obligations less the value of any collateral held 
the following table provides information on mps merchant s credit exposure to customers at december  exposure before credit credit net rating collateral collateral exposure external rating millions investment grade non investment grade no external rating total external ratings are determined by using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty 
if a counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity  the determination has been based on the rating of its guarantor 
investment grade counterparties are those with a minimum senior unsecured debt rating of bbb from standard poor s or baa from moody s investors service 
investment risk kcp l maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc  to fund its share of decommissioning the wolf creek nuclear power plant 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on kcp l s balance sheets 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs  however  the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of fixed rate fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates resulting in a hypothetical decrease in the value of the fixed income securities would have resulted in a million reduction in the value of the decommissioning trust funds at december  a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would have resulted in a million reduction in the fair value of the equity securities at december  kcp l s exposure to investment risk associated with the decommissioning trust funds is in large part mitigated due to the fact that kcp l is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs in its rates
