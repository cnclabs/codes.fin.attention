table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results that are subject to important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see item a risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a medical technology company focused on the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders  with a focus on products that treat conditions that affect the aging spine 
our broad product portfolio and pipeline includes a variety of spinal disorder products and systems focused on solutions addressing the cervical  thoracolumbar  intervertebral  minimally invasive  vertebral compression fracture  osteoporotic bone  and spinal stenosis markets 
our principal product offerings are focused on the market for orthopedic spinal disorder solution products  which is estimated in the us to be approximately billion in revenue in and is expected to grow more than annually over the next three years 
our surgeons culture emphasizes collaboration with spinal surgeons to conceptualize  design and co develop a broad range of products 
we have a state of the art  in house manufacturing facility that provides us with a unique competitive advantage  and enables us to rapidly deliver solutions to meet surgeons and patients critical needs 
our products and systems are made of titanium  titanium alloy  stainless steel and a strong  heat resistant  radiolucent  biocompatible plastic called polyetheretherketone  or peek 
we also sell products made of allograft  a precision milled and processed human bone that surgeons can use in place of metal and synthetic materials 
we also sell bone grafting products that are comprised of both tissue based and synthetic materials 
we believe that our products and systems have enhanced features and benefits that make them attractive to surgeons and that our broad portfolio of products and systems provide a comprehensive solution for the safe and successful surgical treatment of spine disorders 
all of our implants that are sold in the us have been cleared by the us food and drug administration  or the fda  and these products have been used in over  and  spine disorder surgeries in and  respectively 
in addition to selling our products in the us  we also sell our products in japan  the european union and hong kong 
although our products generally are purchased by hospitals and surgical centers  orders are typically placed at the request of surgeons who then use our products in a surgical procedure 
during the twelve months ended december  and december   no single surgeon  hospital or surgical center represented greater than of our consolidated revenues 
additionally  we sell a broad array of products  which diminishes our reliance on any single product or spine disorder 
in  as part of our strategy to focus on disorders affecting the aging spine  we began entering into license agreements with third parties that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and commercialize unique products for the treatment of spinal disorders that disproportionately affect the aging population 
through december   we licensed approximately patent and patent applications from third parties 
a discussion of our license agreements may be found in item business intellectual property included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
to assist us in evaluating our product development strategy  we regularly monitor long term technology trends in the spinal implant industry 
additionally  we consider the information obtained from discussions with the surgeon community and our scientific advisory board in connection with the demand for our products  including potential new product launches 
we also use this information to help determine our competitive position in the spinal implant industry and the capacity requirements of our manufacturing facility 

table of contents revenue and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our revenues and expenses revenues 
we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of spinal surgery implants used in the treatment of spine disorders 
spinal implant products include spine screw systems  vertebral body replacement devices  plates and bone grafting materials 
our revenues are generated by our direct sales force and independent distributors 
our products are ordered directly by surgeons and shipped and billed to hospitals or surgical centers 
in japan  where orthopedic trauma surgeons also perform spine surgeries  we have sold and will continue to sell orthopedic trauma products in order to introduce our spine products to japanese surgeons 
in europe  we use independent distributors that purchase our products and market them to their surgeon customers 
as a result of offering payment terms greater than our customary us business terms and operating in a new market in which we have no prior experience  revenues for sales to our european distributors have been deferred until payments become due or cash is received 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of direct product costs  royalties  and the amortization of purchased intangibles

we recorded income tax expense of million for fiscal year ended  primarily attributable to us operations of million and foreign income taxes of million with the tax effect of changes in deferred tax liabilities associated with goodwill that is amortizable for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents of million  accounts receivable  net of million  and remaining amounts available under our credit facilities of million 
we believe such amounts will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through at least december  we will need to invest in working capital and capitalized surgical instruments in order to support our revenue projections through should we not be able to achieve our revenue forecast and cash consumption starts to exceed forecasted consumption  management will need to adjust our investment in surgical instruments and manage our inventory to the decreased sales volumes 
if management does not make these adjustments in a timely manner  there could be an adverse impact on our financial resources 
historically  our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products  proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt 
our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations  acquisitions of businesses and intellectual property rights  payments relating to purchases of property and equipment and repayments of borrowings 
we expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  and potential acquisitions 
we expect that  as our revenues grow  our sales and marketing and research and development expenses will continue to grow and  as a result  we will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve profitability 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  revenues from our operations  and our ability to draw down on secured credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements including potential r d license milestone obligations through at least january  if we believe it is in our interest to raise additional funds  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow additional money 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any 
table of contents additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
a substantial portion of our available cash funds is in business accounts with reputable financial institutions 
however  our deposits  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
the capital markets have recently been highly volatile and there has been a lack of liquidity for certain financial instruments  especially those with exposure to mortgage backed securities and auction rate securities 
this lack of liquidity has made it difficult for the fair value of these types of instruments to be determined 
we do not hold any marketable securities as of december  as a result of recent volatility in the capital markets  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
operating activities we used net cash of million in operating activities for the year ended december  during this period  net cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of a net loss of million  a decrease in working capital and other assets of million  primarily due to increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million in support of the higher sales volume  partially offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenues of million  and offset by million of non cash costs including amortization  depreciation  deferred income taxes  stock based compensation  in process research and development that was purchased using our common stock and interest expense related to amortization of debt discount and issue costs 
investing activities we used net cash of million in investing activities for the year ended december  primarily for the purchase of million in instruments  computer equipment  leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment  partially offset by the million return of the scient x license fee and million repayment of a certificate of deposit that served as collateral for a standby letter of credit issued to secure the lines of credit for alphatec pacific with resona bank 
financing activities we generated net cash of million from financing activities for the year ended december  proceeds from borrowings under our lines of credit  term loan and other notes payable totaled million

we do not currently anticipate repaying the debt early 
the working capital line of credit carries a variable interest rate equal to the prime rate plus either or  depending on our financial performance 
interest only payments are due monthly and the principal is due at maturity in april the funds from the credit facility were used to pay off our existing line of credit of million and equipment notes of approximately million  both of which were due to gecc and will serve as a source of capital for ongoing operations and working capital needs 
in connection with the termination of the gecc credit agreement  we also paid an early termination fee of million 
we received from the lenders net proceeds of million after the repayment of amounts due to gecc  less debt issuance costs of approximately million and other transaction fees 
in connection with the term loan  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock 
the warrants are immediately exercisable and have an exercise price of per share and a ten year term 
we recorded the value of the warrants of million as a debt discount 
we are also required to maintain compliance with financial covenants in our credit facility  which include a minimum level of revenues and a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non cash charges related to equity based compensation and in process r d 
the credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements of this type  including  but not limited to  limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness  asset dispositions  acquisitions  investments  dividends and other restricted payments  liens and transactions with affiliates 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the credit facility 
to secure the repayment of any amounts borrowed under the loan agreement  we granted the lenders a first priority security interest in all of our assets  other than our intellectual property and our rights under license agreements granting us the right to intellectual property 
we also agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber our intellectual property assets 
the lenders have the right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in an event of default under the credit facility  which includes  among other things  the failure to make payments when due  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants  the occurrence of certain insolvency events  or the occurrence of an event which could have a material adverse effect on us

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 
determination of criteria iii and iv are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
specifically  our revenue from sales of medical devices is recognized upon receipt of written acknowledgement that the product has been used in a surgical procedure or upon shipment to third party customers who immediately accept title and the related risks and rewards that go with it 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
during  we sold products to a new distributor in europe  which included extended payment terms and was secured by an irrevocable letter of credit 
as a result of offering payment terms greater than our customary us business terms and operating in a new market in which we had no prior experience  revenues for this purchase by the distributor have been deferred until either payments become due or until cash is received for such purchases 
during  we shipped product to a new us distributor  which did not have a extensive credit history 
as a result of a lack of extensive credit history  revenues for this purchase by the distributor have been deferred until cash is received 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and the overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts may be required 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost primarily determined under the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a periodic basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory  and record a reserve for the identified items 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our biologic implant inventories have a five year shelf life and are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative implant products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are subject to uncertainty as we are a high growth company  and we are continually reviewing our existing products and introducing new products 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional reserves based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding increase to cost of revenues and establish a new cost basis for the part 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets annually in december or each quarter if business conditions change and an earlier impairment indicator arises 
this assessment requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
these assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances a determination that the carrying value of such assets can not be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and the related amortization expense on our estimate of the useful life of the assets 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimate  in which case the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
the amount of expense recognized during the period is affected by many complex and subjective assumptions  including estimates of our future volatility  the expected term for our stock options  option exercise behavior  the number of options expected to ultimately vest  and the timing of vesting for our share based awards 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards 
the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award 
our estimated volatility through december  was based on a weighted average volatility of our actual historical volatility since our initial public offering in june 
table of contents and the historical stock volatilities of similar peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available 
our calculation of estimated volatility is based in part on historical stock prices of these peer entities over a period equal to the expected life of the awards 
we continue to use the historical volatility of peer entities due to the lack of sufficient historical data of our stock price since our initial public offering in as prescribed under the simplified method of the sec s sab no 

our estimated volatility may increase or decrease depending on the changes in our peer entities historical stock prices  changes in the composition of the peer entity group and changes to the expected term of our stock option awards 
an increase in the estimated volatility would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
through december   we calculated the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period 
an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield curve of a zero coupon us treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award 
an increase in the risk free interest rate would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we use historical data to estimate the number of future stock option forfeitures 
share based compensation recorded in our consolidated statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from our actual forfeitures which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period 
we account for stock option grants to non employees in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which require that the fair value of these instruments be recognized as an expense over the period in which the related services are rendered 
under sfas no  r  share based compensation expense of awards with performance conditions is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the time the applicable condition is met 
determining the likelihood and timing of achieving performance conditions is a subjective judgment made by management which may affect the amount and timing of expense related to these share based awards 
share based compensation is adjusted to reflect the value of options which ultimately vest as such amounts become known in future periods 
as a result of these subjective and forward looking estimates  the actual value of our share based awards could differ significantly from those amounts recorded in our financial statements 
stock based compensation has been classified as follows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in thousands  except per share data year ended december  cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total effect on basic and diluted net loss per share the amounts above include stock based compensation expense of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  related to the vesting of stock 
table of contents options and awards granted to non employees under consulting agreements 
in addition  million of compensation expense is included in the amount above for the year ended december  relating to the consulting agreement we have with stout 
the stock based compensation recorded in of million is net of the reversal of million of stock compensation related to certain executives that was recognized in in accordance with their employment contracts  and was reversed as a result of a settlement agreement that was reached in june the amount also included million of ipo bonuses and million for one time stock compensation charges for awards issued to employees with no remaining substantive service requirements 
in the fourth quarter of and continuing into  the company experienced significant turnover at both the executive and management levels  which affected the company s estimated forfeiture rate 
during  the company assessed the impact of such turnover on its forfeiture rate and in turn on stock based compensation 
as a result  the company recorded an adjustment to reduce this expense by approximately million 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the impact of the change in the estimated forfeiture rate to compute stock based compensation was recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period it was determined 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
sets forth an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in making such determination  a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements

 which deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for non financial assets and liabilities  except for certain items  such as our cash equivalents and investments  that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no for non financial assets and non financial liabilities on january  to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits companies to elect to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings 
we did not elect to measure any additional financial instruments at fair value as a result of this statement 
therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  business combinations  which replaces sfas no the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but will require an acquiring company to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent considerations and contractual contingencies  at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in addition  an acquiring company is required to capitalize in process research and development and either amortize it over the life of the product  or expense it upon abandonment or impairment

 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  which identifies the sources of accounting principles and provides entities with a framework for selecting the principles used in preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the current gaap hierarchy has been criticized because it is directed to the auditor rather than the entity  it is complex  and it ranks fasb statements of financial accounting concepts  which are subject to the same level of due process as fasb statements of financial accounting standards  below industry practices that are widely recognized as generally accepted but that are not subject to due process 
the fasb believes the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not its auditor that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
fsp eitf clarifies that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents before vesting should be considered participating securities

fsp eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  on a retrospective basis 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact the adoption of fsp eitf may have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our borrowings under our line of credit expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our outstanding floating rate indebtedness totaled million 
the primary base interest rate is the prime rate 
assuming the outstanding balance on our floating rate indebtedness remains constant over a year  a basis point increase in the interest rate would decrease pre tax income and cash flow by approximately million 
other outstanding debt consists of fixed rate instruments  including the term loan and capital leases 
foreign currency risk while a majority of our business is denominated in us dollars  we maintain operations in foreign countries  primarily japan  that require payments in the local currency 
for the twelve months ended december   our revenues denominated in foreign currencies were million 
of this amount  million of such revenues were denominated in japanese yen and the remaining million was denominated in the euro 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and certain other currencies may affect our results of operations and period to period comparisons of our operating results 
for example  if the value of the us dollar were to increase relative to the japanese yen  then our reported revenues would decrease when we convert the japanese yen into us dollars 
we do not currently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce these risks 
however  the currency exposure in our foreign currency revenues is mitigated because foreign subsidiaries expenses are payable in foreign currencies 
we do not believe we have a material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations at this time 
commodity price risk we purchase raw materials that are processed from commodities  such as titanium and stainless steel 
these purchases expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can impact our product costs 
however  because our raw material prices comprise a small portion of our cost of revenues  we have not experienced any material impact on our results of operations from changes in commodity prices 
a change in commodity prices would not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended december
