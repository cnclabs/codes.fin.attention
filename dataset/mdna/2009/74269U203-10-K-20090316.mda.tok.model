item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our annual report are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
we are a leading provider of bandwidth management  control and protection products and solutions for broadband service providers worldwide 
our products offer network administrators of service providers  governments  universities and enterprises intelligent network traffic identification  control and service management solutions 
our proprietary solution  packetlogic  offers users the ability to monitor network use on an application and user specific basis in real time  and offers real improvements over existing dpi solutions 
this capability allows network administrators to maximize network utilization  reducing the need for additional infrastructure investment 
packetlogic s modular  traffic and service management software is comprised of five individual modules traffic identification and classification  traffic shaping  traffic filtering  flow statistics and web based statistics 
more than service providers  higher education institutions and other organizations with over  systems installed have chosen packetlogic as their network traffic management solution 
we face serious competition from suppliers of standalone dpi products such as allot communications  sandvine  arbor ellacoya and packeteer recently acquired by bluecoat 
we also face competition from vendors supplying platform products with some limited dpi functionality  such as switch routers  routers  session border controllers and voip switches 
in addition  we face competition from vendors that integrate an advertised full dpi solution into their products such as cisco systems  juniper  ericsson and foundry 
most of our competitors are larger  more established and have substantially greater financial and other resources 
some competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with us 
as a result of this competition  we could lose market share and sales  or be forced to reduce our prices to meet competition 
however  we do not believe there is an entrenched dominant supplier in our market 
based on our belief in the superiority of our technology  we see an opportunity for us to capture meaningful market share and benefit from what we believe will be strong growth in the dpi market 
on august   we acquired the stock of netintact ab  a swedish corporation 
on september   we acquired the effective ownership of the stock of netintact pty  an australian company 
during the three months ended october   we emerged from the development stage 
as a result of the netintact ab and netintact pty transactions  our core products and business have changed dramatically 
packetlogic  the flagship product and technology of netintact  now forms the core of our product offering 
we sell our products through our direct sales force  resellers  distributors  and system integrators in the americas  asia pacific  and europe 
we continue to monitor the current unfavorable and uncertain domestic and global economic conditions  and the potential impact on it spending  including spending for the products we sell 
while we believe that our products may be less affected by current conditions than many network products  we believe that our customers are more carefully scrutinizing spending decisions  which could negatively impact our future revenues 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
these estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our audited financial statements for the year ended december  in accordance with sec guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
revenue recognition our most common sale involves the integration of our software and a hardware appliance 
the software is essential to the functionality of the product 
we account for this revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  for all transactions involving software 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer resulting in the existence of persuasive evidence of an arrangement  when product title transfers to the customer as identified by the passage of responsibility in accordance with international chamber of commerce shipping term incoterms  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
our product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our appliances and software licenses 
product sales include a perpetual license to our software 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
virtually all of our sales include support services categorized as service revenue which consist of software updates and customer support 
software updates provide customers access to a constantly growing library of electronic internet traffic identifiers signatures and rights to non specific software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
support includes internet access to technical content  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
receipt of a customer purchase order is the primary method of determining persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery generally occurs when product title has transferred as identified by the passage of responsibility per the incoterms our standard delivery terms are when product is delivered to a common carrier from us  or our subsidiaries 
however  product revenue based on channel partner purchase orders is recorded based on sell through to the end user customers until such time as we have established significant experience with the channel partner s ability to complete the sales process 
additionally  when we introduce new products for which there is no historical evidence of acceptance history  revenue is recognized on the basis of end user acceptance until such history has been established 
since our customer orders contain multiple items such as hardware  software  and services which are delivered at varying times  we determine whether the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting as prescribed under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf states that delivered items should be considered separate units of accounting if delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and if delivery of undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
through december   in virtually all of our contracts  the only element that remained undelivered at the time of product delivery was support and updates 
we determine vsoe for pcs based on sales prices charged to customers based upon renewal pricing for pcs 
each contract or purchase order that we enter into includes a stated rate for pcs 
the renewal rate is equal to the stated rate in the original contract 
we have a history of such renewals  the vast majority of which are at the stated renewal rate on a customer by customer basis 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element for which we do not have a fair value is post contract support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue related to these arrangements is included in ratable product and related support and services revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately and for support and updates is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
prior to the third quarter of  we had not established vsoe for the fair value of support contracts provided to our reseller class of customers 
as such  prior to the third quarter of  we recognized all revenue on transactions sold through resellers ratably over the term of the support contract  typically one year 
beginning in the third quarter of  we determined that we had established vsoe of fair value of support for products sold to resellers  and began recognizing product revenue upon delivery  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition had been met 

table of contents our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill effective september   we completed the acquisition of netintact  a privately held software company and its subsidiaries 
we issued  shares of common stock with a total fair value of million  in exchange for all outstanding shares of netintact ab and netintact pty 
the acquisition was accounted for by using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
we completed the valuation of the intangible assets and analysis of deferred tax liabilities acquired in the netintact transaction pursuant to statement of financial accounting sfas no 
 paragraphs and based on this analysis  the purchase price million was allocated to net worth acquired million  intangible assets million  deferred tax impact million and goodwill 
million 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment as defined in sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in a two step process 
first  we determine if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to our carrying amount to determine if there is an impairment loss 
as of december  and december   we concluded that there was no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
as of december  and december   we have determined that our intangible assets are reasonably stated and are expected to be recovered in the future 

table of contents allowance for doubtful account the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces trade receivables to the amount that is ultimately believed to be collectible 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management reviews the aged receivables on an account by account basis  taking into consideration such factors as the age of the receivables  customer history and estimated continued credit worthiness  as well as general economic and industry trends 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
the fair value of stock options shares was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is measured at grant date and is amortized over the vesting period of the award  net of estimated forfeitures 
all of the company s stock compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument 
the company previously applied accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no

the company recorded employee stock based compensation for the twelve months ended january  for options granted to employees with a market value of the underlying common stock greater than exercise price on the date of grant 
accounting for income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
management believes that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets and  accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been provided against net deferred tax assets 
tax expense has taken into account any change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets where the realization of various deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a two step method of first evaluating whether a tax position has met a more likely than not recognition threshold and second  measuring that tax position to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin provides guidance on the presentation of such positions within a classified statement of financial position as well as on derecognition  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
at the adoption date of january   we had  of unrecognized tax benefits  none of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
results of operations from the date of our inception on may  through july   we were a development stage company  devoting all of our efforts and resources to developing and testing new products and preparing for introduction of our products into the market place

based on current reserves and anticipated cash flow from operations  our working capital may not have been sufficient to meet all of the needs of our business objectives through the end of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  development of additional channel partners and sales territories  introduction of new products  enhancement of existing products  and the continued acceptance of our products 
we may also enter into arrangements that require investment such as complimentary businesses  service expansion  technology partnerships or acquisitions 
on march   the company entered into a secured line of credit for working capital purposes with peninsula bank 
the line of credit agreement provides for maximum borrowings of million through march  we believe  as a result of this line of credit  we currently have sufficient cash and financing commitments to meet our funding requirements over the next year 
however  we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional capital to accomplish all of our business objectives over the next several years 
we expect to seek additional funding through a bank credit facility or private equity 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available 

table of contents contractual obligations 
as of december   procera also had commitments for leased equipment from various sources under non cancelable capital leases with various expiration dates through as shown below 
interest rates on such commitments range from to 
as of december   future minimum lease payments that come due in the current and following fiscal years ending december are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years capital leases operating leases total deferred revenue items the following table represents our deferred revenue for the periods ending december  and december  increase deferred revenue product sales include post contract support and hardware maintenance services which are deferred until earned 
the contract period typically is one year but can range as long as three years 
additionally  when we introduce new products for which there is no historical evidence of acceptance history  revenue is deferred until receipt of end user acceptance until such history has been established 
the increase in deferred revenue during is reflective of an increasing base of customers and related support contract renewals on historical sales 
material commitments of capital we use third party contract manufacturers to assemble and test our products 
in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure an adequate supply of inventories  our agreements with some of these manufacturers allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on its behalf based on a rolling production forecast provided by the company 
we may be contractually obligated to purchase long lead time component inventory procured by certain manufacturers in accordance with our forecasts 
in addition  we issue purchase orders to our third party manufacturers that may not be cancelable at any time 
as of december   we had no open non cancelable purchase orders with our third party manufacturers 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet items as described by item a of regulation s k 
we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales contracts are denominated predominantly in united states dollars  swedish kroner  australian dollars and the euro 
we incur certain operating expenses in united states dollars  swedish kroner and australian dollars 
therefore  we are subject to volatility in cash flows due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the aforementioned currencies 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts since exchange rate fluctuations have had minimal impact on our operating results and cash flows 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market securities  due to the high investment quality and short duration of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair market value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates had fallen by in  our interest income on cash and cash equivalents would have declined immaterially  assuming consistent investment levels
