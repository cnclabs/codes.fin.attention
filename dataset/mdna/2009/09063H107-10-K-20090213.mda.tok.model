item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our credit facilities include restrictive covenants relating to our operations  which could limit our ability to respond to changing market conditions and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our credit facilities impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt 
for example  we are subject to a maximum leverage ratio requirement as defined during the terms of the loans  which could reduce our ability to incur additional debt and consequently reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our credit facilities also contain limitations on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in excess of those required to maintain our reit status 
specifically  our credit facilities limit distributions to of funds from operations  but not less than the minimum necessary to enable us to meet our reit income distribution requirements 
in addition  our credit facilities contain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to further mortgage our properties or reduce insurance coverage  and that require us to 
table of contents maintain specified levels of net worth 
these or other limitations may adversely affect our flexibility and our ability to achieve our operating plans 
if we fail to obtain external sources of capital  which is outside of our control  we may be unable to make distributions to our stockholders  maintain our reit qualification  or fund growth 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit and to avoid incurring a nondeductible excise tax  we are required  among other things  to distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
in addition  we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than of our net taxable income  including any net capital gains 
because of these distribution requirements  we may not be able to fund future capital needs  including any necessary acquisition financing  from operating cash flow 
consequently  we rely on third party sources to fund our capital needs 
we may not be able to obtain financings on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends  in part  on general market conditions  the market s perception of our growth potential  with respect to acquisition financing  the market s perception of the value of the properties to be acquired  our current debt levels  our current and expected future earnings  our cash flow and cash distributions  and the market price per share of our common stock or preferred stock 
our inability to obtain capital from third party sources will adversely affect our business and limit our growth 
without sufficient capital  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 
for distributions with respect to the taxable years ending on or before december   recent internal revenue service guidance allows us to satisfy up to of our distribution requirements through the distribution of shares of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met 
increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders 
interest we pay could reduce cash available for distributions 
additionally  if we incur variable rate debt  including borrowings under our million secured construction loan  our million secured term loan and our million unsecured line of credit  to the extent not adequately hedged  increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs 
these increased interest costs would reduce our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  if we need to repay existing debt during a period of rising interest rates  we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments 
risks related to our organizational structure our charter and maryland law contain provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a change of control transaction and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 
our charter  including the articles supplementary with respect to our preferred stock  contains ownership limits that may delay  defer or prevent a change of control transaction 
our charter  with certain exceptions  authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit 
unless exempted by our board of directors  no person may own more than of the value of our outstanding shares of capital stock or more than in value or number whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or series a preferred stock 
the board may not grant such an exemption to any proposed transferee whose ownership of in excess of of the value of our outstanding shares would result in the termination of our status as a reit 
these restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify as a reit 
the ownership limit may 
table of contents delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
we could authorize and issue stock without stockholder approval that may delay  defer or prevent a change of control transaction 
our charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock 
in addition  our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences  rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares 
the board may also  without stockholder approval  amend our charter to increase the authorized number of shares of our common stock or our preferred stock that we may issue 
the board of directors could establish a series of common stock or preferred stock that could  depending on the terms of such series  delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
certain provisions of maryland law could delay  defer or prevent a change of control transaction 
certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law  or the mgcl  may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control 
in some cases  such an acquisition or change of control could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of their shares 
these mgcl provisions include business combination provisions that  subject to limitations  prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder for certain periods 
an interested stockholder is generally any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate or associate of ours who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock 
a person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder 
business combinations with an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
after that period  the mgcl imposes two super majority voting requirements on such combinations  and control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights unless holders of two thirds of our voting stock excluding interested shares consent 
control shares are shares that  when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder  entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors 
a control share acquisition is the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares 
in the case of the business combination provisions of the mgcl  we opted out by resolution of our board of directors with respect to any business combination between us and any person provided such business combination is first approved by our board of directors including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person 
in the case of the control share provisions of the mgcl  we opted out pursuant to a provision in our bylaws 
however  our board of directors may by resolution elect to opt in to the business combination provisions of the mgcl 
further  we may opt in to the control share provisions of the mgcl in the future by amending our bylaws  which our board of directors can do without stockholder approval 
the partnership agreement of our operating partnership  maryland law  and our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our board of directors may amend our investing and financing policies without stockholder approval  and  accordingly  our stockholders would have limited control over changes in our policies that could increase the risk we default under our debt obligations or that could harm our business  results of operations and share price 
our board of directors has adopted a policy of targeting our indebtedness at approximately of our total asset book value 
however  our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of debt that we may incur  nor do they limit the types of properties we may acquire or develop 
our board of directors may alter or 
table of contents eliminate our current policy on borrowing or investing at any time without stockholder approval 
changes in our strategy or in our investment or leverage policies could expose us to greater credit risk and interest rate risk and could also result in a more leveraged balance sheet 
these factors could result in an increase in our debt service and could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make expected distributions to our stockholders 
higher leverage also increases the risk we would default on our debt 
we may invest in properties with other entities  and our lack of sole decision making authority or reliance on a co venturer s financial condition could make these joint venture investments risky 
we have in the past and may continue in the future to co invest with third parties through partnerships  joint ventures or other entities 
we may acquire non controlling interests or share responsibility for managing the affairs of a property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
in such events  we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the property or entity 
investments in entities may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not present were a third party not involved 
these risks include the possibility that partners or co venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 
such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions  such as a sale  because neither we nor the partner or co venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture 
disputes between us and partners or co venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business 
in addition  we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party partners or co venturers if we structure a joint venture or conduct business in a manner that is deemed to be a general partnership with a third party  in which case we could be liable for the acts of that third party  third party managers incur debt or other liabilities on behalf of a joint venture which the joint venture is unable to pay  and the joint venture agreement provides for capital calls  in which case we could be liable to make contributions as set forth in any such joint venture agreement  or we agree to cross default provisions or to cross collateralize our properties with the properties in a joint venture  in which case we could face liability if there is a default relating to those properties in the joint venture or the obligations relating to those properties 
we have investments in joint ventures with prei  which were formed in the second quarter of while we  as managing member  are authorized to carry out the day to day management of the business and affairs of the prei joint ventures  prei s prior written consent is required for certain decisions  including decisions relating to financing  budgeting and the sale or pledge of interests in the properties owned by the prei joint ventures 
in addition  each of the prei operating agreements includes a put call option whereby either member can cause the limited liability company to sell certain properties in which it holds leasehold interests to us at any time after the fifth anniversary and before the seventh anniversary of the acquisition date 
the put call option may be exercised at a time we do not deem favorable for financial or other reasons  including the availability of cash at such time and the impact of tax consequences resulting from any sale 
risks related to our reit status our failure to qualify as a reit under the code would result in significant adverse tax consequences to us and would adversely affect our business and the value of our stock 
we believe that we have operated and intend to continue operating in a manner intended to allow us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there 
table of contents are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations 
the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through a partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a seemingly minor technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
our reit status depends upon various factual matters and circumstances that may not be entirely within our control 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources  and we must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of our assets 
also  we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least of our reit taxable income  excluding capital gains 
in addition  new legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions  each of which could have retroactive effect  may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit  or could reduce the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that we qualify as a reit  and the statements in this report are not binding on the irs or any court 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will face serious adverse tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and for distribution to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit we would not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  we could also be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  and unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year in which we were disqualified 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders  however  all distributions to our stockholders would be subject to tax as qualifying corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
as a result of all these factors  our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock and our preferred stock 
to maintain our reit status  we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions to make distributions to our stockholders 
to qualify as a reit  we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income each year  determined by excluding any net capital gain  and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than of our reit taxable income each year 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and of our undistributed income from prior years 
for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december   recent internal revenue service guidance allows us to satisfy up to of these requirements through the distribution of shares of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met 
to maintain our reit status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements 
these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes  the effect of non deductible capital expenditures  the creation of reserves  or required debt or amortization payments 
we may need to borrow funds at times when the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for borrowing 
these borrowings could increase our costs or reduce our equity and adversely affect the value of our common stock or preferred stock 

table of contents to maintain our reit status  we may be forced to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock 
we may be required to make distributions to stockholders at times when it would be more advantageous to reinvest cash in our business or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 
risks related to the ownership of our stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has recently been  and may continue to be  volatile 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends  changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates  publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry  increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield  changes in market valuations of similar companies  adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur or acquisitions we make in the future  additions or departures of key management personnel  actions by institutional stockholders  speculation in the press or investment community  the realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this report  and general market and economic conditions 
broad market fluctuations could negatively impact the market price of our common stock or preferred stock 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that have been unrelated to these companies operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock or preferred stock 
furthermore  our operating results and prospects may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors or may be lower than those of companies with comparable market capitalizations 
either of these factors could lead to a material decline in the market price of our common stock or preferred stock 
market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
one of the factors that will influence the price of our common stock and preferred stock will be the dividend yield on such stock as a percentage of the price of the stock relative to market interest rates 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock or series a preferred stock to expect a higher dividend yield  and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our common stock and series a preferred stock to fall 

table of contents our distributions to stockholders may decline at any time 
we may not continue our current level of distributions to stockholders 
our board of directors will determine future distributions based on a number of factors  including cash available for distribution  operating results  our financial condition  especially in relation to our anticipated future capital needs  then current expansion plans  the distribution requirements for reits under the code  and other factors our board deems relevant 
the number of shares of our common stock available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we cannot predict whether future issuances of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares for resale in the open market will decrease the market price per share of our common stock 
as of december    shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding  as well as our operating partnership units and long term incentive plan  or ltip  units which may be exchanged for  and  shares of our common stock  respectively  based on the number of shares of common stock  operating partnership units and ltip units outstanding as of december  in addition  as of december   we had reserved an additional  shares of common stock for future issuance under our incentive award plan and  shares potentially issuable upon exchange of our exchangeable senior notes 
sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market  or upon exchange of operating partnership units  ltip units or our exchangeable senior notes  or the perception that such sales might occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  under the rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission in december regarding registration and offering procedures  if we meet the definition of a well known seasoned issuer under rule of the securities act  we are permitted to file an automatic shelf registration statement that will be immediately effective upon filing 
on september   we filed such an automatic shelf registration statement  which may permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants and other securities to the extent necessary or advisable to meet our liquidity needs 
any of the following could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock the exchange of operating partnership units  ltip units or our exchangeable senior notes for common stock  additional grants of ltip units  restricted stock or other securities to our directors  executive officers and other employees under our incentive award plan  additional issuances of preferred stock with liquidation or distribution preferences  and other issuances of our common stock 
additionally  the existence of operating partnership units  ltip units or our exchangeable senior notes and shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of operating partnership units  ltip units or our exchangeable senior notes and under our incentive award plan may adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
in addition  future sales of shares of our common stock may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
from time to time we also may issue shares of our common stock or operating partnership units in connection with property  portfolio or business acquisitions 
we may grant additional demand or piggyback registration rights in connection with these issuances 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that these sales could occur  may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock or may adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities

overview as used herein  the terms we  us  our or the company refer to biomed realty trust  inc  a maryland corporation  and any of our subsidiaries  including biomed realty  lp  a maryland limited partnership our operating partnership 
we operate as a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit focused on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
our tenants primarily include biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  scientific research institutions  government agencies and other entities involved in the life science industry 
our properties are generally located in markets with well established reputations as centers for scientific research  including boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  maryland  pennsylvania and new york new jersey 
we were formed on april  and completed our initial public offering on august  as of december   our portfolio consisted of properties  representing buildings with an aggregate of approximately million rentable square feet  including approximately million square feet of development in progress 
we also owned undeveloped land parcels adjacent to existing properties that we estimate can support up to approximately million rentable square feet of laboratory and office space 
factors which may influence future operations our long term corporate strategy is to continue to focus on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
as of december   our operating portfolio was leased to tenants 
as of december   our operating portfolio was leased to tenants 
the decrease in the overall leasing percentage is a reflection of an increase in the rentable square footage in our operating portfolio  which increased by approximately  rentable square feet in the year ended december  due to the completion of development or redevelopment activities at a number of properties 
total leased square footage during the same period increased by approximately  square feet within the operating portfolio 
leases representing approximately of our leased square footage expire during and leases representing approximately of our leased square footage expire during our leasing strategy for focuses on leasing currently vacant space and negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the year  and identifying new tenants or existing tenants seeking additional space to occupy the spaces for which we are unable to negotiate such renewals 
we may proceed with additional new developments  as real estate and capital market conditions permit 
redevelopment development properties we are actively engaged in the redevelopment and development of certain properties in our portfolio 
we believe that these activities will ultimately result in a return on our additional investment once the redevelopment and development activities have been completed and the properties are leased 
however  redevelopment and development activities involve inherent risks and assumptions relating to our ability to fully lease the properties 
our objective is that these properties will be fully leased upon completion of the construction activities 
however  our ability to fully lease the properties may be adversely affected by changing market conditions  including periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  declining demand for life science office and laboratory space  local oversupply of real estate assets  or competition from others  which may diminish our opportunities for leasing the property on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may fail to retain tenants that have pre leased our 
table of contents properties  or may face significant monetary penalties  if we do not complete the construction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants specifications 
further  our competitors with greater resources may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract tenants to their properties  which could put pressure on our ability to attract tenants at rental rates that will provide an expected return on our additional investment in these properties 
as a result  we may be unable to fully lease some of our redevelopment development properties in a timely manner upon the completion of major construction activities 
we also rely on external sources of debt and equity funding to provide capital for our redevelopment and development projects 
although we believe that we currently have sufficient borrowing capacity and will be able to obtain additional funding as necessary  we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all or we may be forced to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  which may require us to adjust our business and construction plans accordingly 
further  we may spend more time or money than anticipated to redevelop or develop our properties due to delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations or other unanticipated delays in the construction 
the following summarizes our consolidated properties under repositioning or redevelopment at december  total property estimated full rentable percent in service property square feet leased date elliott avenue  q pacific research center  q total weighted average our estimate of the time in which redevelopment will be substantially complete 
we estimate that the projects will be substantially complete and held available for their intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activities 
we currently estimate that we will invest up to an additional million before the redevelopment on these properties is substantially complete

a previously undeveloped portion of the property was undergoing development as of december  and has been reflected separately from the stabilized portion of the property 
however  we have not separated this previously undeveloped portion into a separate property for legal and accounting purposes 
therefore  we still classify the landmark at eastview property as a stabilized property although it is also included in our discussion of development properties

the maturity dates for approximately  and  leased square feet originally expiring on august  and december   respectively  were extended through december  pursuant to lease amendments executed with a tenant on january  the success of our leasing and development strategy will be dependent upon the general economic conditions and more specifically real estate market conditions and life science industry trends in the united states and in our target markets of boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  maryland  pennsylvania  new york new jersey and research parks near or adjacent to universities 
we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be released at rental rates equal to or above the current contractual rental rates or at all 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they address the most material parts of our financial statements  require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents investments in real estate investments in real estate are carried at depreciated cost 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years ground lease term of the related lease tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives or the terms of the related leases furniture  fixtures  and equipment to years acquired in place leases non cancelable term of the related lease acquired management agreements non cancelable term of the related agreement our estimates of useful lives have a direct impact on our net income 
if expected useful lives of our investments in real estate were shortened  we would depreciate the assets over a shorter time period  resulting in an increase to depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease to net income on an annual basis 
management must make significant assumptions in determining the value of assets and liabilities acquired 
the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase cost of the acquired properties would affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 
the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  buildings  and improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consisting of acquired in place leases and acquired management agreements are recorded based on a variety of considerations including  but not necessarily limited to a the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in place leases ie the market cost to execute a lease  including leasing commissions and legal fees  if any  b the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease up period ie real estate taxes and insurance  and c the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease up period 
the fair value assigned to the acquired management agreements are recorded at the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the management agreements acquired of the acquired management agreements with certain tenants of the acquired properties 
the values of in place leases and management agreements are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable period of the respective leases or agreements 
if a lease were to be terminated or if termination is determined to be likely eg  in the case of a tenant bankruptcy prior to its contractual expiration  amortization of all unamortized amounts related to that lease would be accelerated and such amounts written off 
costs incurred in connection with the acquisition  development or construction of properties and improvements are capitalized 
capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other direct costs incurred during the period of development 
we capitalize costs on land and buildings under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy 
the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
we consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction 
capitalized costs associated with unsuccessful acquisitions are charged to expense when an acquisition is no longer considered probable 
repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized 
repairs and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or 
table of contents increase its operating efficiency 
significant replacement and betterments represent costs that extend an asset s useful life or increase its operating efficiency 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the long lived asset s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in long lived assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
although our strategy is to hold our properties over the long term  if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
revenue recognition we commence revenue recognition on our leases based on a number of factors 
in most cases  revenue recognition under a lease begins when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased asset 
generally  this occurs on the lease commencement date 
in determining what constitutes the leased asset  we evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements 
if we are the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements  then the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition begins when the lessee takes possession of the finished space  typically when the improvements are substantially complete 
if we conclude that we are not the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements the lessee is the owner  then the leased asset is the unimproved space and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives  which reduce revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining non cancelable term of the respective lease 
in these circumstances  we begin revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for the lessee to construct improvements 
the determination of who is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements determines the nature of the leased asset and when revenue recognition under a lease begins 
we consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes 
these factors include whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent  whether the tenant or landlord retain legal title to the improvements  the uniqueness of the improvements  the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease  the responsible party for construction cost overruns  and who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements 
the determination of who owns the tenant improvements  for accounting purposes  is subject to significant judgment 
in making that determination we consider all of the above factors 
however  no one factor is determinative in reaching a conclusion 
all leases are classified as operating leases and minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in accrued straight line rents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and contractually due but unpaid rents are included in accounts receivable 
existing leases at acquired properties are reviewed at the time of acquisition to determine if contractual rents are above or below current market rents for the acquired 
table of contents property 
an identifiable lease intangible asset or liability is recorded based on the present value using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases at acquisition  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated or if termination were determined to be likely eg  in the case of a tenant bankruptcy prior to its contractual expiration  amortization of the related unamortized above or below market lease intangible would be accelerated and such amounts written off 
substantially all rental operations expenses  consisting of real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs are recoverable from tenants under the terms of our lease agreements 
amounts recovered are dependent on several factors  including occupancy and lease terms 
tenant recovery revenue is recognized in the period the expenses are incurred 
the reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with emerging issues tax force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
eitf requires that these reimbursements be recorded gross  as the company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the credit risk 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled  collectability is assured  and we have no continuing obligation to provide space to former tenants 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent and tenant recovery payments or defaults 
we may also maintain an allowance for accrued straight line rents and amounts due from lease terminations based on our assessment of the collectability of the balance 
payments received under master lease agreements entered into with the sellers of properties to lease space that was not producing rent at the time of the acquisition are recorded as a reduction to buildings and improvements rather than as rental income in accordance with eitf  recognition of receipts from made up rental shortfalls 
investments in partnerships we evaluate our investments in limited liability companies and partnerships under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities and the determination of which business enterprise should consolidate the variable interest entity the primary beneficiary 
generally  fin r applies when either the equity investors if any lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
if fin r does not apply  we consider eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  which provides guidance in determining whether a general partner controls a limited partnership 
eitf states that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership 
the presumption may be overcome if the limited partners have either the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or substantive participating rights  which provide the limited partners with the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership s business and thereby preclude 
table of contents the general partner from exercising unilateral control over the partnership 
if the criteria in eitf are met  the consolidation of the partnership or limited liability company is required 
except for investments that are consolidated in accordance with fin r or eitf  we account for investments in entities over which we exercise significant influence  but do not control  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity in the investment is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and our share of net income or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income 
on a periodic basis  we assess whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of our investments in partnerships or limited liability companies may be impaired on a more than temporary basis 
an investment is impaired only if our estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment on a more than temporary basis 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements  accordingly  the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances 
as of december   we have applied the provisions of sfas to the valuation of our interest rate swaps  which are the only financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value in order to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
however  we have not elected to measure any additional financial instruments and other items at fair value other than those previously required under other gaap rules or standards under the provisions of this standard 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
currently  we use forward starting and interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk 
the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves 
the fair 
table of contents values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments or receipts 
the variable cash payments or receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves 
to comply with the provisions of sfas  we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 
derivative instruments we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we use interest rate swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during and  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt and future variability in the interest related cash flows from forecasted issuances of debt 
we formally document the hedging relationships for all derivative instruments  we have historically accounted for all of our interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges  and we have not used derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   the hedging relationships for two of our four forward starting swaps were no longer considered highly effective and we were required to prospectively discontinue hedge accounting for these two swaps under sfas no

general and administrative expenses increased  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to continued growth in the corporate infrastructure necessary to support our expanded property portfolio  additional salary and stock compensation costs associated with the retirement of one of our executive officers  and costs associated with our new corporate headquarters  which was completed in the first quarter of  partially offset by lower bonuses for senior management

during the year ended december   we capitalized million of interest compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease reflects the partial or complete cessation of capitalized interest at our center for life science boston  towne centre drive  and fairview avenue development projects and our pacific research center redevelopment project due to the commencement of certain leases at those properties 
we expect capitalized interest costs on these and other properties currently under development or redevelopment to decrease as rentable space at these properties are readied for their intended uses through net of capitalized interest and the accretion of debt premium  interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we expect interest expense to continue to increase in as additional properties currently under development or redevelopment are readied for their intended uses and placed in service  and also due to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement on january   which will increase the amount of non cash interest we recognize related to the exchangeable senior notes 

table of contents loss on derivative instruments 
we have four forward starting swaps that were acquired to mitigate our exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in future interest rates associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt by april  such fixed rate debt was generally expected to be issued in connection with a refinancing of our secured construction loan 
the four forward starting swaps had an aggregate notional value of million 
at december   the hedging relationships for two of our four forward starting swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of million  were no longer considered highly effective as the expectation of forecasted interest payments had changed  and we were required to prospectively discontinue hedge accounting for these two swaps 
as a result  a portion of the unrealized losses related to these forward starting swaps previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  totaling million  was reclassified to the consolidated income statement as loss on derivative instruments in the fourth quarter of prospective changes in the fair value of these two swaps will be recorded in the consolidated income statements through the date the swaps are settled 
the loss on derivative instruments for the year ended december  also includes approximately million of hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges due to mismatches in forecasted debt issuance dates  maturity dates and interest rate reset dates of the interest rate and forward starting swaps and related debt 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
in november  we repurchased approximately million face value of our exchangeable senior notes for approximately million 
the repurchase resulted in the recognition of a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately million net of the write off of approximately  in deferred loan fees  which is reflected in our consolidated statements of income

depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense for properties acquired in and and the acceleration of depreciation on assets related to an early lease termination in the amount of million  which is included as a redevelopment property 
the increase was partially offset by the cessation of depreciation on certain properties  or portions thereof  currently under redevelopment  and the full amortization of acquired intangible assets in and at certain properties 
general and administrative expenses
