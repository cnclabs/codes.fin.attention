item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial and operating data and our audited financial statements and the respective related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a rapidly growing  value priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories for the entire family 
our merchandise offerings are designed to appeal to the preferences of fashion conscious consumers  particularly african americans 
originally our stores were located in the southeast  and in recent years we expanded into the mid atlantic and midwest regions and the state of texas 
we operate stores in both urban and rural markets in states 
we are pursuing an aggressive store growth strategy and believe that the addition of new stores will be the primary source of future growth 
in fiscal we opened new stores  entering the philadelphia  pennsylvania and kansas city  kansas markets for the first time 
we expect to open approximately new stores in fiscal approximately of the new stores we intend to open in fiscal will be located in states that we currently serve 
we measure performance using key operating statistics 
one of the main performance measures we use is comparable store sales growth 
we define a comparable store as a store that has been opened for an entire fiscal year 
therefore  a store will not be considered a comparable store until its th month of operation at the earliest or until its th month at the latest 
as an example  stores opened in fiscal and fiscal were not considered comparable stores in fiscal relocated and expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales results 
we also use other operating statistics  most notably average sales per store  to measure our performance 
as we typically occupy existing space in established shopping centers rather than sites built specifically for our stores  store square footage and therefore sales per square foot varies by store 
we focus on overall store sales volume as the critical driver of profitability 
the average sales per store has increased over the years  as we have increased comparable store sales and opened new stores that are generally larger than our historical store base 
average sales per store have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in addition to sales  we measure gross profit as a percentage of sales and store operating expenses  with a particular focus on labor  as a percentage of sales 
these results translate into store level contribution  which we use to evaluate overall performance of each individual store 
finally  we monitor corporate expenses against budgeted amounts 
basis of the presentation net sales consist of store sales and layaway fees  net of returns by customers 
cost of sales consists of the cost of products we sell and associated freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised of store costs  including payroll and store occupancy costs  corporate and distribution center costs and advertising costs 
we operate on a or week fiscal year  which ends on the saturday closest to january each of our fiscal quarters consists of four week periods  with an extra week added to the fourth quarter every five to six years 
the years ended january   february   february   january  and january  are referred to as fiscal    and  respectively 
fiscal year is comprised of weeks 
fiscal years   and are each comprised of weeks 
results of operations the following discussion of our financial performance is based on the financial statements set forth in the financial pages of this report 
the nature of our business is seasonal 
historically  sales in the first and fourth quarters have been higher than sales achieved in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
expenses and  to a greater extent  operating income  vary by quarter 
results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year 
furthermore  the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods 

table of contents net sales and additional operating data the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statement of income data expressed both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  february  february  dollars in thousands statement of income data net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest income interest expense income before income tax expense income tax expense net income the following table provides information  for the periods indicated  about the number of total stores open at the beginning of the period  stores opened and closed during each period  total stores open at the end of each period and comparable store sales for the periods fiscal year ended january  february  february  total stores open  beginning of period new stores closed stores total stores open  end of period comparable store sales increase stores included in the comparable store sales calculation for any period are those stores that were opened prior to the beginning of the preceding fiscal year and were still open at the end of such period 
relocated stores and expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales results 
the company is reporting comparable store sales on a comparable store and comparable weeks basis  for fiscal  the weeks ended february  are compared to the weeks ended february   for fiscal  the weeks ended february  are compared to the weeks ended february  
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales was due to new store openings in fiscal and new store openings in fiscal for which there was not a full year of sales in  partially offset by the closing of one store in comparable store sales were up less than in fiscal the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the increase in sales  the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the increase  and the comparable stores contributed million in additional sales  while the closed store had the effect of reducing sales by million 
comparable stores include locations that have been relocated or expanded 
there were stores relocated or expanded in fiscal and stores relocated or expanded in fiscal sales in these comparable relocated and expanded stores increased in fiscal  while sales in all other comparable stores decreased 
the negligible increase in comparable store sales included a increase in the average customer purchase  offset by a similar decrease in the number of customer transactions 
comparable store sales changes by major merchandise class were as follows children s  home  men s  women s  accessories 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is a result of the increase in sales  together with an improvement in the gross margin from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase in gross margin resulted primarily from merchandise markdowns being approximately basis points lower as a percentage of sales due to improved management of inventory levels 
in addition  gross margin benefited from inventory shrinkage being approximately basis points lower due to the steps taken in the past year to better control inventory shrinkage  including  a reduction in the span of control given to our district managers in order to increase the level of supervision  a greater focus on problem stores by the store operations and loss prevention departments  the addition of sophisticated surveillance systems in high shrinkage stores  and lower inventory levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in these expenses was due primarily to additional store level  distribution and corporate costs arising from the opening of new stores in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to the deleveraging effect that occurs on expenses as a percentage of sales when comparable store sales increase at a rate that is lower than the rate of inflation on expenses 
in particular  payroll related costs increased basis points due to this deleveraging effect  together with higher incentive compensation expense resulting from better results in relation to goals  and an increase in store supervision costs in connection with a reduction in the span of control given to our district managers 
these increases in the expense percentage were partially offset by the benefit in this year s comparison of approximately  of expenses last year related to a secondary stock offering and stock registration of which the company received no proceeds 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as the result of capital expenditures incurred for new and relocated expanded stores and the expansion of the darlington distribution center 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to higher interest rates earned on our investments in auction rate securities once the auctions of such securities began to fail in february and due to an increase in market rates for a short period of time during the banking crisis in the third quarter 
by the end of fiscal  market interest rates had declined from levels earlier in the year  which will likely cause interest income in fiscal to be significantly lower than in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the normal decline in the interest portion of payments on our capital lease obligations as the principal portion of such obligations is reduced 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to higher pretax earnings in the effective income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were virtually unchanged at and  respectively 
if interest income earned on tax free investments declines as expected in  it will cause the effective income tax rate to increase due to the reduction in tax free income 
net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales was due to new store openings in fiscal  new store openings in fiscal for which there was not a 
table of contents full year of sales in  and a comparable store sales increase of note that is based on a week fiscal compared to the comparable weeks in the prior year  partially offset by the week fiscal having an extra week 
the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the total increase in sales  the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the increase  and the comparable stores contributed million of the increase in sales on a comparable week versus week basis  but had a million decrease on a fiscal year basis due to the extra week in fiscal sales in the extra week in fiscal were million 
the increase in comparable store sales on a comparable weeks basis included a slight increase in the number of items per sale transaction  partially offset by slight declines in the number of transactions and the average item price 
comparable store sales changes by major merchandise class were as follows children s  home  women s  men s  accessories 
comparable stores include locations that have been relocated or expanded 
there were stores relocated or expanded in fiscal and stores relocated or expanded in fiscal sales in these comparable relocated and expanded stores increased in fiscal  while sales in all other comparable stores decreased 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is a result of the increase in sales  partially offset by a reduction in the gross margin 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a basis points increase in merchandise markdowns as a percentage of sales 
the increase in markdowns occurred in the third and fourth quarters due to negative comparable store sales during the months of september and october in the third quarter and during the critical month of december in the fourth quarter 
with comparable store sales being negative during those months  higher clearance markdowns were necessary 
inventory shrinkage was basis points higher year over year  however  the increase in shrinkage was offset by a slightly higher initial merchandise mark up and slightly lower freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in these expenses was due primarily to additional store level  distribution and corporate costs arising from the opening of new stores in fiscal and approximately  of expenses related to a secondary stock offering and stock registration of which the company received no proceeds 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to the deleveraging effect that occurs on expenses as a percentage of sales when comparable store sales increase at a rate that is lower than the rate of inflation on expenses 
in particular  occupancy expenses as a percent of sales were up basis points and payroll was basis points higher 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as the result of capital expenditures incurred for new and relocated expanded stores and for new scanning technology used in the stores 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher interest rates and a slightly higher average investment balance throughout the year 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the addition of a million capital equipment lease in fiscal income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the effective income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the tax rate decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of continued increases in income tax credits and tax exempt interest income  while pretax income was decreasing 
net income 
net income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  expansion of our distribution infrastructure  construction of new stores  remodeling of our existing stores and the improvement of our information systems 
historically  we have met these cash requirements from cash flow from operations  short term trade credit  borrowings under our revolving lines of credit  long term debt and capital leases  and cash proceeds from our initial public offering 
we expect to be able to meet future cash requirements with cash flow from operations  short term trade credit  existing cash balances and  if necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility described below 
in fiscal  there was no need to borrow under the credit facility  including during the seasonal build of inventory in advance of the christmas season 
due to our strong cash and cash equivalents position at january  million  we believe that we will likely not have to borrow under the credit facility during fiscal 
table of contents discussion of cash flows fiscal compared to fiscal as of january   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared with total cash and cash equivalents of million as of february  the most significant factors in the increase in our net liquidity position during fiscal were positive cash flow from operations and net sales redemptions of investment securities  partially offset by capital expenditures 
inventory represented of our total assets as of january  management s ability to manage our inventory can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given interim period or fiscal year 
in addition  inventory purchases can be seasonal in nature  such as the purchase of warm weather or christmas related merchandise 
cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the main source of cash provided during fiscal was net income  adjusted for noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  loss on disposal of property and equipment  and stock based compensation expense  totaling million 
in addition  cash provided by operating activities benefited from accounts payable increasing million  despite inventory increasing only million  due to improved inventory turnover which caused a greater percentage of inventory purchases to be included in accounts payable at the end of fiscal the only significant use of cash  other than inventory  was a million increase in prepaid and other current assets due to an increase in receivables from landlords for tenant improvement reimbursements  as the result of an effort by us to take on more of the construction work for new store leasehold improvements  in order to better control the projects  in return for reimbursements from the landlords  and normal increases in credit card receivables  prepaid rent and prepaid insurance due to the company s growth 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash used for the purchase of property and equipment was million lower during fiscal than in fiscal due primarily to the larger portion of the capital expenditures related to the expansion of the darlington  south carolina distribution center occurring in fiscal in addition  fiscal capital expenditures included the purchase of our corporate headquarters inventory storage facility in savannah  georgia that had previously been leased 
sales redemptions of municipal auction rate securities  net of purchases  provided cash of million and million in and  respectively 
cash flows used in provided by financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal and cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal cash used in financing activities consisted of payments on capital lease obligations totaling million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  cash totaling million was used in fiscal to settle a stock option exercise 
cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million in and million in until required for other purposes  we maintain cash and cash equivalents in deposit or money market accounts 
fiscal compared to fiscal as of february   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared with total cash and cash equivalents of million as of february  the most significant factors in the change in our net liquidity position during fiscal were positive cash flow from operations and net sales of investment securities  offset by capital expenditures 
inventory represented of our total assets as of february  management s ability to manage our inventory can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given interim period or fiscal year 
in addition  inventory purchases can be seasonal in nature  such as the purchase of warm weather or christmas related merchandise 
cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the main sources of cash provided during fiscal were net income  adjusted for noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  loss on disposal of property and equipment  and noncash stock based compensation expense  totaling million  and an increase in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities of million 
uses of cash consisted of a million increase in inventory  a million decrease in accounts payable and a million increase in prepaid assets 
the change in income taxes payable was substantially offset by excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 
accounts payable did not increase as would typically be the case when inventory increases  because inventory turns slowed down  particularly over the last five months of fiscal when comparable store sales were negative 
the decline in inventory turns forced us to take significantly more merchandise markdowns  as discussed in the fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit section above  and caused us to slow down purchases in the last half of the year 
this reduction in purchases contributed to the decrease in accounts payable at year end 
additionally  we took advantage of more opportunistic purchases of next season buy 
table of contents merchandise in such purchases are paid for well in advance of shipping the merchandise to our stores  causing a reduction in inventory turns and in accounts payable as a percentage of inventory 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash used for the purchase of property and equipment increased during fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to capital expenditures in the amount of million in fiscal for the build out of new stores and twelve store relocations expansions  purchase of our corporate headquarters inventory storage facility in savannah  georgia that had previously been leased  construction work related to the expansion of the darlington  south carolina distribution center  and other general corporate purposes  compared to million million  excluding equipment financed by capital leases in fiscal for the build out of new stores and seven relocations expansions  purchase of markdown scanners  build out of our distribution center in darlington  and other general corporate purposes 
net sales of municipal auction rate securities provided cash of million in  while net purchases of such securities used cash of million in cash flows provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities consisted primarily of the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million in and million in  partially offset by repayments on long term debt and capital lease obligations totaling million and million in and  respectively 
liquidity sources  requirements and contractual cash requirements and commitments our principal sources of liquidity consist of i cash and cash equivalents which equaled million as of january   ii short term trade credit  iii cash generated from operations on an ongoing basis as we sell our merchandise inventory  and iv a million revolving credit facility 
trade credit represents a significant source of financing for inventory purchases and arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors 
historically  our principal liquidity requirements have been for working capital and capital expenditure needs 
as of january   we had million at par value of investments in municipal auction rate securities ars issued by student loan funding organizations 
these securities are high grade at least aa rated with one or more rating agencies and approximately are either guaranteed by the department of education under the federal family education loan program or backed by insurance companies  ambac assurance corporation or mbia insurance corporation 
historically  liquidity for investors in ars was provided via an auction process that reset the interest rate every days  allowing investors to either roll over their investments or sell them at par value 
beginning in february  there was insufficient demand for these types of investments during the auctions and  as a result  these securities became illiquid 
although the auctions for the securities have failed  certain issuers did redeem  at par value  million of ars held by us  and one of our investment banks purchased  at par value  million of ars held by us 
in addition  we have not experienced any defaults and continue to earn and receive interest on all of the investments that we still own 
in november  we accepted an offer the right from ubs ag ubs allowing us to sell at par value our remaining ars to ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  in accepting the right  we granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par value at any time up until the expiration date of the right and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of ars 
we will continue to earn interest on the ars until they are liquidated 
the obligations of ubs under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to purchase the ars 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the right 
if ubs does not have sufficient funding to buy back the ars and no alternative buyers are located either through the auction process  issuer redemptions or other means  then we may not be able to access cash by selling these securities without incurring a loss of principal 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately million to million in fiscal these expenditures will relate principally to the capital costs associated with approximately stores that we plan to open in fiscal we plan to finance these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances and  if necessary  borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 

table of contents the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of january  and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations represents fixed minimum rents in stores and does not include incremental rents which are computed as a percentage of net sales 
for example  in fiscal incremental percentage rent was approximately million  which represented of total rent expense 
indebtedness 
in march  we obtained a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america  replacing a million facility that had been scheduled to expire on june  this new facility has a term of days  has an unused commitment fee equal to  and has one restrictive financial covenant consolidated leverage ratio 
our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and rent expense have been well in excess of the level required by the consolidated leverage ratio 
loans under the facility bear interest at either a a rate equal to the higher of i the federal funds rate plus and ii bank of america s prime rate  plus an applicable margin  or b a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and ranges from to for libor based loans  and from to for prime rate based loans 
we have had no borrowings under this facility 
on march   we amended the credit facility with bank of america to extend the expiration date to march  and to lower the commitment to million  reflecting our year end cash position and the fact that we have had no borrowings under the facility 
in addition  changes were made to the pricing of the facility  including an increase in the unused commitment fee to and an amendment of the interest rates 
loans under the facility now bear interest at either a a rate equal to the highest of i the federal funds rate plus  ii libor plus and iii bank of america s prime rate  plus an applicable margin  or b a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and ranges from to for loans bearing interest at the rate described under a above and from to for loans bearing interest at the rate described under b above 
we previously had a million revolving line of credit with wachovia capital finance secured by substantially all of our assets and pursuant to which we paid customary fees 
this secured line of credit expired on april  and was not renewed 
capital leases 
we have capital lease obligations that financed the purchase of technology equipment 
as of january   our capital lease obligations  including interest  were million 
these obligations have a maturity date of december and an interest rate of 
all of these obligations are secured by the technology equipment 
the lease agreements contain cross default provisions which result in a default if the company is out of compliance with any other borrowing agreements 
operating leases 
we lease our stores under operating leases  which generally have an initial term of five years with renewal options 
the typical store lease requires a combination of both fixed monthly rents and contingent rents computed as a percentage of net sales after a certain sales threshold has been met 
for fiscal  rent expense was million compared to million in fiscal including approximately million and million of percentage rent  respectively  in fiscal and 
purchase obligations 
as of january   we had purchase obligations of million  all of which were for less than one year 
these purchase obligations primarily consist of outstanding merchandise orders 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the store operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents outstanding stock options as of january   we had outstanding vested options to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share and outstanding unvested options to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
the per share value of each share of common stock underlying the vested and unvested options  based on the difference between the exercise price per option and the estimated fair market value of the shares at the dates of the grant of the options also referred to as intrinsic value  ranges from to per share 
based on the closing price of our common stock of per share on january   the intrinsic value of the options outstanding on january  was  all of which related to vested options 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition while the recognition of revenue is predominantly derived from routine retail transactions and does not involve significant judgment  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of ours 
we recognize retail sales net of sales taxes at the time the customer takes possession of and pays for merchandise  less an allowance for returns 
we allow for returns up to ten days after the date of sale and we reduce revenues for each fiscal year for returns in the ten days after the year ends 
as of january   the reserve for returns was  revenue from layaway sales is recognized when the customer has paid for and received the merchandise 
if the merchandise is not fully paid for within sixty days  the customer is given a store credit for merchandise payments made  less a re stocking fee and a layaway service charge 
layaway service charges  which are non refundable  are recognized in revenue when collected 
all sales are from cash  check or major credit card company transactions 
we do not offer company sponsored customer credit accounts or gift cards 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to revenue recognition during fiscal inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market as determined by the retail inventory method  less a provision for estimated inventory shrinkage 
under the retail inventory method  the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory 
inherent in the retail inventory calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
we estimate shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in actual shrinkage trends 
inventory shrinkage as a percentage of sales has ranged from to during fiscal years through we believe the first in  first out retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated 
many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions  which ultimately affect the value of the inventory 
we do not generally enter into such arrangements with our vendors 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal property and equipment  net we have a significant investment in property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of the required minimum lease payments 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives primarily three to five years for computer equipment and furniture  fixtures and equipment  five years for leasehold improvements  seven years for major purchased software systems  and fifteen to twenty years for buildings and building improvements of the related assets or the relevant lease term  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
any reduction in these estimated useful lives would result in a higher annual depreciation expense for the related assets 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal 
table of contents impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of the useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss for long lived assets 
future adverse changes in market and legal conditions  or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of long lived assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge 
if facts and circumstances indicate that a long lived asset  including property and equipment  may be impaired  the carrying value is reviewed 
if this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends  and thus could be significantly different from historical results 
to the extent our estimates for net sales  gross profit and store expenses are not realized  future assessments of recoverability could result in impairment charges 
there were no impairment charges during fiscal years through there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to impairment of long lived assets during fiscal fair value measurements effective february   we adopted the methods of fair value as described in sfas no 
 fair value measurements  to value our financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market at the measurement date 
this statement also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels  which are described below level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level inputs 
level observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets  but corroborated by market data 
level unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available 
level inputs are given the lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy 
as of january   we had million at par value of investments in municipal auction rate securities ars issued by student loan funding organizations 
the ars are classified as trading securities in noncurrent assets and are reflected at estimated fair value 
these securities are high grade at least aa rated with one or more rating agencies and approximately are either guaranteed by the department of education under the federal family education loan program or backed by insurance companies  ambac assurance corporation or mbia insurance corporation 
historically  liquidity for investors in ars was provided via an auction process that reset the interest rate every days  allowing investors to either roll over their investments or sell them at par value 
beginning in february  there was insufficient demand for these types of investments during the auctions and  as a result  these securities became illiquid 
although the auctions for the securities have failed  certain issuers did redeem  at par value  million of ars held by us  and one of our investment banks purchased  at par value  million of ars held by us 
in addition  we have not experienced any defaults and continue to earn and receive interest on all of the investments that we still own 
there was insufficient observable market information available as of january  to determine the fair value of ars held by us 
accordingly  we estimated level fair values for these securities based on assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
these assumptions included  among other things  discounted cash flow projections  the timing of expected future successful auctions or redemptions  collateralization of the underlying securities and the creditworthiness of the issuers and insurance companies 
based on this level valuation  we valued the ars investments at million as of january   representing a million decline from par value 
prior to fiscal  the ars were valued at par value due to the frequent resets that historically occurred through the auction process 
in november  we accepted an offer the right from ubs ag ubs allowing us to sell at par value our remaining ars to ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  in accepting the right  we granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par value at any time up until the expiration date of the right and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of ars 
we will continue to earn interest on the ars until they are liquidated 
the obligations of ubs under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to purchase the ars 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the right 
if ubs does not have sufficient funding to buy back the ars and no alternative buyers are located either through the auction process  issuer redemptions or other means  then we may not be able to access cash by selling these securities without incurring a loss of principal 

table of contents the right represents a put option and is recognized as an instrument separate from the ars 
we elected to account for this right at fair value under sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
we valued the right using a discounted cash flow approach that includes estimates of interest rates and the credit risk associated with ubs 
this valuation is based on unobservable inputs  therefore  represents a level fair value 
we recorded a million gain associated with the right  together with the million ars impairment charge discussed above 
we expect that subsequent changes in the value of the right will largely offset the subsequent fair value movements of the ars  subject to the continued expected performance by ubs of its obligations under the right 
stock based compensation sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on the estimated fair value of the award 
the determination of the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using an option price model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the fair values of options issued pursuant to the stock based compensation plans are estimated at each grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing model  while grants of nonvested restricted stock are valued based on the closing stock price on the grant date 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal operating leases we lease all of our store properties and account for the leases as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
many lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances  rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
for purposes of recognizing incentives and minimum rent expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  we use the date of initial possession to begin amortization  which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in preparation of intended use 
for scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing rent holidays at a date other than the date of initial occupancy  we record minimum rent expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
for tenant improvement allowances we record a deferred rent liability on the balance sheet and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases 
certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception 
these contingent rents are primarily based on a percentage of net sales that are in excess of a predetermined level 
these amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to operating leases during fiscal accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the computation of income taxes is subject to estimation due to the judgment required and the uncertainty related to the recoverability of deferred tax assets or the outcome of tax audits 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period it is determined that actual results will differ from our estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the year in which such changes are enacted 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to income taxes during fiscal the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies 
in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
was effective november  and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 

table of contents effective february   we adopted sfas no 
which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards  except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to  but not intended to be  fair value and does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of statement no 
 which provided a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to our financial assets and financial liabilities only in fiscal the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
effective february   we adopted sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas  which clarified the application of sfas no 
in cases where a market is not active 
we have considered the guidance provided by fsp fas in our determination of fair values as of january   and the impact was not material 
effective february   we adopted sfas no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure specified financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is applied on a contract by contract basis

in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  share based payment sab 
sab allows for continued use of the simplified method for estimating the expected term of plain vanilla share option grants under specified conditions 
the expected term used to value a share option grant under the simplified method is the mid point between the vesting date and the contractual term of the share option 
sab eliminates the december  sunset provision previously specified in sab sab is effective for share option grants made on or after january  we have utilized the simplified method for estimating the expected term of our stock option grants under sab and sab and will continue to utilize this simplified method until we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks related to changes in interest rates connected with our revolving credit facility  which bears interest at variable rates 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates 
as a result  future results may differ materially from estimated results due to adverse changes in interest rates or debt availability 
a hypothetical basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for fiscal  because we did not borrow during the year 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes and have not entered into any interest rate hedging contracts 
we source all of our product from apparel markets in the united states in us dollars and  therefore  are not directly subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our purchasing power with vendors that import merchandise to sell to us 
we have not entered into forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices 
as of january   we had million at par value of investments in municipal auction rate securities ars issued by student loan funding organizations 
these securities are high grade at least aa rated with one or more rating agencies and approximately are either guaranteed by the department of education under the federal family education loan program or backed by insurance companies  ambac assurance corporation or mbia insurance corporation 
historically  liquidity for investors in ars was provided via an auction process that reset the interest rate every days  allowing investors to either roll over their investments or sell them at par value 
beginning in february  there was insufficient demand for these types of investments during the auctions and  as a result  these securities became illiquid 
although the auctions for the securities have failed  certain issuers did redeem  at par value  million of ars held by us  and one of our investment banks purchased  at par value  million of ars held by us 
in addition  we have not experienced any defaults and continue to earn and receive interest on all of the investments that we still own 
however  interest rates had declined by the end of fiscal to levels that were much lower than earlier in the year 
as a result  interest income may be significantly lower in than in in november  we accepted an offer the right from ubs ag ubs allowing us to sell at par value our remaining ars to ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  in accepting the right  we granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par value at any time up until the expiration date of the right and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of ars 
we will continue to earn interest on the ars until they are liquidated 
the obligations of ubs under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to purchase the ars 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the right 
if ubs does not have sufficient funding to buy back the ars and no alternative buyers are located either through the auction process  issuer redemptions or other means  then we may not be able to access cash by selling these securities without incurring a loss of principal
