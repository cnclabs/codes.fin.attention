significant accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company and lakeland conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  lakeland  lakeland investment corp  and lakeland nj investment corp 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates implicit in these financial statements are as follows 
the principal estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of the company s security portfolio  the company s deferred 
table of contents tax asset and the analysis of goodwill impairment 
the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses includes  among other factors  an analysis of historical loss rates  by category  applied to current loan and lease totals 
however  actual losses may be higher or lower than historical trends  which vary 
actual losses on specified problem loans and leases  which also are provided for in the evaluation  may vary from estimated loss percentages  which are established based upon a limited number of potential loss classifications 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense 
loan principal considered to be uncollectible by management is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio 
the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the loan and lease portfolio  overall portfolio quality  specific problem loans and leases  and current economic conditions which may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
the evaluation also details historical losses by loan and lease category  the resulting loss rates for which are projected at current loan and lease total amounts 
loss estimates for specified problem loans and leases are also detailed 
all of the factors considered in the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses may be subject to change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan and lease losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
the company accounts for impaired loans and leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
the company s available for sale securities portfolio is recorded at fair value 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
we also adopted financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp no 
fas which provided additional guidance on valuation and disclosures 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  credit ratings and yield curves 
fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security 
when the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost  and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost  additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other than temporary impairment condition exists 
available for sale and held to maturity securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the analysis considers i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
often  the information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing  making estimates of fair value subject to judgment 
if actual information or conditions are different than estimated  the extent of the impairment of the security may be different than previously estimated  which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 

table of contents deferred tax expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are the allowance for loan and lease losses  core deposit intangible  deferred loan fees  deferred compensation and securities available for sale 
on january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  to account for any tax positions that may be uncertain 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
additional information regarding the company s uncertain tax positions is set forth in note to the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the company accounts for goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined that it has one reporting unit  community banking 
the company analyzes goodwill using various market valuation methodologies including an analysis of the company s enterprise value and a comparison of pricing multiples in recent acquisitions of similar companies and applying these multiples to the company

december  commercial leases real estate mortgage real estate construction home equity and consumer installment at december   there were no concentrations of loans or leases exceeding of total loans and leases outstanding other than loans that are secured by real estate 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain categories of loans as of december   in terms of contractual maturity date within one year after one but within five years after five years total in thousands types of loans commercial real estate construction total amount of such loans with predetermined rates floating or adjustable rates total risk elements commercial loans and leases are placed on a non accrual status with all accrued interest and unpaid interest reversed if a because of the deterioration in the financial position of the borrower they are maintained on a cash basis which means payments are applied when and as received rather than on a regularly scheduled basis  b payment in full of interest or principal is not expected  or c principal and interest have been in default for a period of days or more unless the obligation is both well secured and in process of collection 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status at the time when foreclosure proceedings are commenced  except where there exists sufficient collateral to cover the defaulted principal and interest payments  and management s knowledge of the specific circumstances warrant continued accrual 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and interest payments are four months in arrears unless the obligations are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest thereafter on such charged off consumer loans is taken into income when received only after full recovery of principal 
the following schedule sets forth certain information regarding the company s non accrual and past due loans and leases and other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of december  for each of the last five years at december  in thousands non performing assets non accrual loans and leases other real estate and other repossessed assets total non performing assets non performing assets as a percent of total assets past due loans and leases represents loans and leases as to which payments of interest or principal are contractually past due days or more  but which are currently accruing income at the contractually stated rates 
a determination is made to continue accruing income on such loans and leases only if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course and collection efforts are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status 

table of contents non accrual loans and leases increased to million on december  from million at december  the million increase in non accrual loans is attributable to a deterioration in the company s leasing portfolio 
at year end  million in leases were on non accrual  million of which were attributable to two originators who indicated that they could no longer fulfill all of their obligations under contractual recourse provisions 
at december   the company had million in leases outstanding from these originators  representing  leases of which approximately were current or less than days past due 
non accrual loans also included million in commercial loans which declined from million at year end all non accrual loans and leases are in various stages of litigation  foreclosure  or workout

loans and leases which are well secured and in process of collection generally will not be classified as impaired 
a loan or lease is not impaired during the process of collection of payment if the company expects to collect all amounts due  including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate 
all commercial loans in excess of  identified as impaired are evaluated by an independent loan review consultant 
the company aggregates consumer loans and residential mortgages for evaluation purposes 
the company s policy concerning commercial non accrual loans and leases states that  except for loans and leases which are considered to be fully collectible by virtue of collateral held and in the process of collection  loans and leases are placed on a non accrual status when payments are days delinquent or more 
it is possible for a loan or lease to be on non accrual status and not be classified as impaired if the balance of such loan or lease is relatively small and  therefore  has not been specifically reviewed for impairment 
loans and leases  or portions thereof  are charged off in the period that the loss is identified 
until such time  an allowance for loan or lease loss is maintained for estimated losses 
with regard to interest income recognition for payments received on impaired loans and leases  as well as all non accrual loans and leases  the company follows regulatory guidelines  which apply any payments to principal as long as there is doubt as to the collectibility of the balance 
as of december   based on the above criteria  the company had impaired loans and leases totaling million consisting primarily of non accrual loans and leases 
the impairment of these loans and leases is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral 
based upon such evaluation  million has been allocated to the allowance for loan and lease losses for impairment 
at december   the company also had million in loans and leases that were rated substandard that were not classified as non performing or impaired 
there were no additional loans or leases at december   other than those designated non performing  impaired or substandard  where the company was aware of any credit conditions of any borrowers that would indicate a strong possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in such loans or leases being included as non accrual  past due or renegotiated at a future date 

table of contents the following table sets forth for each of the five years ended december   the historical relationships among the amount of loans and leases outstanding  the allowance for loan and lease losses  the provision for loan and lease losses  the amount of loans and leases charged off and the amount of loan and lease recoveries december  in thousands balance of the allowance at the beginning of the year loans and leases charged off commercial leases home equity and consumer real estate mortgage total loans and leases charged off recoveries commercial leases home equity and consumer real estate mortgage total recoveries net charge offs addition related to acquisitions provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations ending balance ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases outstanding ratio of allowance at end of year as a percentage of year end total loans and leases includes charge offs of million and million in and  respectively  related to the settlement of certain litigation concerning the commercial lease pools 
the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to loans outstanding reflects management s evaluation of the underlying credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis 
methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following criteria the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified classified loans and leases that have been designated as requiring attention by the company or the company s external loan review consultant 
the establishment of reserves for pools of homogeneous types of loans and leases not subject to specific review  including family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
the establishment of reserve amounts for the non classified loans and leases in each portfolio based upon the historical average loss experience for these portfolios and management s evaluation of key factors 

table of contents consideration is given to the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending staff  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
since many of the company s loans depend on the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all accompanying factors related to the loan and lease portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate at december  the preceding statement constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the following table shows how the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated among the various types of loans and leases that the company has outstanding 
this allocation is based on management s specific review of the credit risk of the outstanding loans and leases in each category as well as historical trends

table of contents interest rate risk closely related to the concept of liquidity is the concept of interest rate sensitivity ie  the extent to which assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is often measured by the extent to which mismatches or gaps occur in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
gap analysis is utilized to quantify such mismatches 
a positive gap results when the amount of earning assets repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within that time period 
a negative gap results when the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of earning assets repricing within such time period 
in general  a financial institution with a positive gap in relevant time periods will benefit from an increase in market interest rates and will experience erosion in net interest income if such rates fall 
likewise  a financial institution with a negative gap in relevant time periods will normally benefit from a decrease in market interest rates and will be adversely affected by an increase in rates 
by maintaining a balanced interest rate sensitivity position  where interest rate sensitive assets roughly equal interest sensitive liabilities in relevant time periods  interest rate risk can be limited 
as a financial institution  the company s potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of its market risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
based upon the company s nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any hedging transactions in place  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the company s board of directors has adopted an asset liability policy designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements 
this policy outlines guidelines and ratios dealing with  among others  liquidity  volatile liability dependence  investment portfolio composition  loan portfolio composition  loan to deposit ratio and gap analysis ratio 
the company s performance as compared to the asset liability policy is monitored by its board of directors 
in addition  to effectively administer the asset liability policy and to monitor exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company maintains an asset liability committee  consisting of the chief executive officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  chief retail officer  chief credit officer  certain other senior officers and certain directors 
this committee meets quarterly to review the company s financial results and to develop strategies to implement the asset liability policy and to respond to market conditions 
the company monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques  including use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis also known as gap analysis and an interest rate risk management model 
with the interest rate risk management model  the company projects future net interest income  and then estimates the effect of various changes in interest rates and balance sheet growth rates on that projected net interest income 
the company also uses the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
traditional gap analysis involves arranging the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference or interest rate sensitivity gap between the assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period 
both interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
interest rate sensitivity modeling requires  among other things  estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates  future cash flows and discount rates 
gap analysis requires estimates as to when individual categories of interest sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice  and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period will reprice at the same time and in the same amount 
gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 

table of contents the following table sets forth the estimated maturity repricing structure of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  except as stated below  the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability adjusted for prepayments assuming the interest rate environment prevailing in the fourth quarter of interest bearing demand  savings and money market accounts are estimated to exhibit some rate sensitivity based on management s analysis of deposit withdrawals and based on certain types of accounts that are tied to rate indices 
the majority of interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits are assumed to be core deposits  or deposits that will generally remain at the company regardless of market interest rates 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities  for example  prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits  is beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels

therefore  these techniques may not accurately reflect the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income or net portfolio value 
because of the limitations in the gap analysis discussed above  members of the company s asset liability committee believe that the interest sensitivity modeling more accurately reflects the effects and exposure to changes in interest rates 
net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core

as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the balance sheet to those changes 
market value of portfolio equity represents the fair value of the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
the starting point or base case for the following table is an estimate of the company s net portfolio value at december  using current discount rates  and an estimate of net interest income for assuming that both interest rates and the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities remain at december  levels 
the information provided for the net portfolio value assumes fluctuations or rate shocks of plus basis points and minus basis points 
rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately 
the information provided for net interest income for assumes that changes in interest rates of plus basis points and minus basis points change gradually in equal increments over the twelve month period

effects of inflation the impact of inflation  as it affects banks  differs substantially from the impact on non financial institutions 
banks have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to move with inflation 
this is especially true for banks with a high percentage of rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a bank can further reduce the impact of inflation with proper management of its rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
lakeland attempts to structure its assets and liabilities and manages its gap to protect against substantial changes in interest rate scenarios  in order to minimize the potential effects of inflation
