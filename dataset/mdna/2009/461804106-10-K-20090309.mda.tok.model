item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k annual report for additional information related to the revenues  income and assets attributable to the company s primary operating segments 
title insurance through its two wholly owned title underwriting subsidiaries  itic and ne itic  the company underwrites land title insurance for owners and mortgagees as a primary insurer 
itic and ne itic offer primary title insurance coverage to both owners and mortgagees of real estate and also offers the reinsurance of title insurance risks to other title insurance companies 
title insurance protects against loss or damage resulting from title defects that affect real property 
the commitment and policies issued are predominantly the standard american land title association alta approved forms 
upon a real estate closing  the seller executes a deed to the new owner 
when real property is conveyed from one party to another  occasionally there is an undisclosed defect in the title or a mistake or omission in a prior deed  will or mortgage that may give a third party a legal claim against such property 
if a claim is made against real property  title insurance provides indemnification against insured defects 
a title defect is one of any number of things that could jeopardize the property owner s or mortgagee s interest in the property defined in the title policy 
such risks include title being vested in someone or some entity other than the insured  unmarketable title  lack of a right of access to the property  invalidity or unenforceability of the insured mortgage  or other defects  liens  or encumbrances against the property 
examples of common types of covered risks include defects arising from prior unsatisfied mortgages  tax liens or confirmed assessments  judgments against the property or encumbrances against the property arising through easements  restrictions or other existing covenants 
title insurance also generally protects against deeds or mortgages that contain inaccurate legal descriptions  that were forged or improperly acknowledged or delivered  that were executed by spouses without the other spouse s signature or release of marital interest or that were conveyed by minors or incompetents 
title insurance policies 
there are two basic types of title insurance policies one for the mortgage lender and one for the real estate owner 
a lender often requires property owners to purchase title insurance to protect its position as a holder of a mortgage loan  but the lender s title insurance policy does not protect the property owner 
the property owner has to purchase a separate owner s title insurance policy to protect their investment 
the company issues title insurance policies on the basis of a title report 
the title report documents the current status of title to the property 
insured risk on policies in force 
generally  the amount of the insured risk or face amount of insurance on a title insurance policy is equal to the lesser of the purchase price of the insured property or the fair market value of the property 
in the event that a claim is made against the property  the insurer is responsible for paying the legal costs associated with eliminating covered title defects or defending the insured party against covered title defects affecting the property 
the insurer may choose to pay the policy limits to the insured or  if the loss is less than policy limits  the amount of the insured s actual loss due to the title defect  at which time the insurer s duty to defend the claim and all other obligations of the insurer with respect to the claim are satisfied 
at any given time  the insurer s actual risk of monetary loss under outstanding policies is only a portion of the aggregate insured risk  or total face amount  of all policies in force 
the lower risk results primarily from the reissuance of title insurance policies by other underwriters over time when the property is conveyed or refinanced 
the coverage on a lender s title insurance policy is reduced and eventually terminated as the mortgage loan it secures is paid 
an owner s policy is effective as long as the insured has an ownership interest in the property or has liability under warranties of title 
due to the variability of these factors  the aggregate contingent liability of a title underwriter on outstanding policies of the company and its subsidiaries cannot be determined with any precision 
losses and reserves 
while most other forms of insurance provide for the assumption of risk of loss arising out of unforeseen events  title insurance is based upon a process of loss avoidance 
title insurance generally serves to protect the policyholder from the risk of loss from events that predate the issuance of the policy 
losses on policies typically occur when a title defect is not discovered during the examination and settlement process or the occurrence of certain hidden risks which cannot be determined from an accurate search of public land records 
the maximum amount of liability under a title insurance policy is generally the face amount of the policy plus the cost of defending the insured s title against an adverse claim 
reserves for claim losses are established based upon known claims  as well as estimated losses incurred but not yet reported to the company  based upon historical experience and other factors 
title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts  are affected by economic and market conditions and may involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure  and therefore  reserve estimates are subject to variability

geographic operations 
itic was incorporated in the state of north carolina on january   and became licensed to write title insurance in the state of north carolina on february  at present  itic primarily writes land title insurance in states  mostly in the eastern half of the united states 
itic is licensed to write title insurance in states and the district of columbia 
ne itic was incorporated in the state of south carolina on february   and became licensed to write title insurance in that state on november  it currently writes title insurance as a primary insurer and as a reinsurer in the state of new york 
ne itic is also licensed to write title insurance in additional states and the district of columbia 
premiums from title insurance written in the state of north carolina represent the largest source of revenue for the title insurance segment 
in the state of north carolina  itic primarily issues title insurance commitments and policies through branch offices 
title policies are primarily issued through issuing agents in other states 
for a description of the level of net premiums written geographically by state  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k 
each state license authorizing itic or ne itic to write title insurance must be renewed annually 
these licenses are necessary for the companies to operate as a title insurer in each state in which they write premiums 
ratings 
the company s title insurance subsidiaries are regularly assigned ratings by independent agencies designed to indicate their financial condition and or their claims paying ability 
the rating agencies determine ratings primarily by analyzing financial data 
itic has been rated by two independent fannie mae approved financial analysis firms  demotech  inc and lace financial corporation lace  with financial stability ratings of a a double prime and b  respectively 
ne itic s financial stability also has been recognized by demotech  inc and lace with ratings of a a double prime and a  respectively 
according to demotech  title underwriters earning a financial stability rating of a a double prime possess unsurpassed financial stability related to maintaining positive surplus as regards policyholders  regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the title insurance cycle 
a lace rating of a or b indicates that a title insurance company has a strong overall financial condition that will allow it to meet its future claims  and that  generally  the company has good operating earnings  is well capitalized and has adequate reserves 
reinsurance 
the company assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurance companies in the normal course of business 
reinsurance is a contractual arrangement whereby one insurer assumes some or all of the risk exposure written by another insurer 
ceded reinsurance is comprised of excess of loss treaties  which protects against losses over certain amounts 
in the ordinary course of business  itic and ne itic reinsure certain risks with other title insurers for the purpose of limiting their risk exposure and to comply with state insurance regulations 
they also assume reinsurance for certain risks of other title insurers for which they receive additional income 
for the last three years  revenues from reinsurance activities accounted for less than of total premium volume 
exchange services in  the company established investors title exchange corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary itec  to provide services in connection with tax deferred exchanges of like kind property pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
itec acts as an intermediary in tax deferred exchanges of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investments  and its income is derived from fees for handling exchange transactions and interest earned on client deposits held by the company 
investors title accommodation corporation itac provides services for accomplishing reverse exchanges when taxpayers decide to acquire replacement property before selling the relinquished property 
the services provided by the company s exchange segment are pursuant to provisions in the internal revenue code 
from time to time  these laws are subject to review and changes  which may negatively affect the demand for tax deferred exchanges in general  and consequently the revenues and profitability of the company s exchange segment 
in july  the internal revenue service irs finalized its proposed regulations regarding treatment of funds held by qualified intermediaries 
as originally proposed  the rules would have negatively affected the ability of qualified intermediaries to retain a portion of the interest earned on exchange funds held during exchange transactions  which could have had a material adverse effect upon the profitability of the company s exchange segment 
as adopted however  the new regulations apply only to individual exchange account balances over million 
in addition  the final regulations clarify that qualified intermediaries may earn marketing fees from financial institutions 
the company currently believes that any marketing fees earned on deposits in the future would at least partially offset the loss of interest spread retained on exchange deposits under prior business practices 
consequently  the company currently believes that the final regulations should not have a material impact on the earnings of the exchange services segment 
the regulations however have only recently been adopted  and therefore the company has had only limited experience under this new regime  it is possible that these new regulations may have unanticipated consequences that will negatively affect tax deferred exchanges  which could have an adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of the company s exchange services segment 
in addition  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k annual report for additional information regarding irs regulations 
investment management and trust services other services provided include those offered by investors trust company investors trust  investors capital management company icmc  and investors title management services  inc itms  all wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
investors trust and icmc work together to provide investment management and trust services to individuals  companies  banks and trusts 
itms offers various consulting services to provide clients with the technical expertise to start and successfully operate a title insurance agency 
these subsidiaries are not currently a reportable segment for which financial information is presented in the company s financial statements and are included and reported in the category all other 
operations of subsidiaries title insurance itic and ne itic issue title insurance coverage through direct operations or through partially owned or independent title insurance agents who issue title policies on behalf of itic or ne itic 
title insurance premiums written reflect a one time premium payment  with no recurring premiums 
generally  premiums are recorded and recognized as revenue at the time of closing of the related transaction as the earnings process is considered complete 
where the policy is issued directly through a branch office  the premiums collected are retained by the company 
where the policy is issued through a title insurance agent  the agent retains a majority of the premium as a commission 
title insurance commissions earned by the company s agents are recognized as expense concurrently with premium recognition 
the percentage of the premium retained by agents varies by region to region and is sometimes regulated by the states 
for a description of the level of net premiums written by direct and agency operations  refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
exchange services itec and itac provide customer services in connection with tax deferred exchanges pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
acting as a qualified intermediary  itec holds the proceeds from sales of relinquished properties until the acquisition of identified replacement properties occurs 
itac facilitates reverse tax deferred exchanges pursuant to irs revenue procedure cyclicality and seasonality title insurance real estate activity is cyclical in nature 
title insurance premiums are closely related to the level of real estate activity and the volume of mortgage origination 
a number of general and economic factors influence demand for title insurance  including changes in mortgage interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing  consumer confidence  economic conditions  supply and demand and family income levels 
the title insurance business tends to be seasonal as well as cyclical 
historically  the winter months have the least real estate activity because fewer real estate transactions occur  while the remaining quarters are more active 
refinance activity is generally less seasonal  but it is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the company anticipates that current market conditions  including weakening home sales and falling home prices  rising foreclosures and the sub prime lending crisis  will be the primary influences on the company s operations until some stabilization occurs 
exchange services seasonal and other factors affecting the level of real estate activity and the volume of title premiums written will also generally affect the demand for exchange services 
marketing title insurance the company markets its title insurance services to a broad range of customers in the residential and commercial market sectors of the real estate industry 
issuing agents are typically real estate attorneys or subsidiaries of community and regional mortgage lending institutions  depending on local customs and regulations and the company s marketing strategy in a particular territory 
itic and ne itic strive to provide superior service to their customers and consider this an important factor in attracting and retaining customers 
branch and corporate personnel strive to develop new business and agency relationships to increase market share and itic s commercial services division provides services to commercial clients 
exchange services marketing of tax deferred exchange services offered by itec and itac has been incorporated into the marketing of the core title products offered by itic and ne itic 
the commercial services division of itic also markets the services offered by itec and itac to its commercial clients 
regulation title insurance the company is an insurance holding company and therefore it is subject to regulation in the states in which its insurance subsidiaries do business 
these regulations  among other things  require insurance holding companies to register and file certain reports and require prior regulatory approval of the payment of dividends and other intercompany distributions or transfers 
title insurance companies are extensively regulated under applicable state laws 
all states have requirements for admission to do business as an insurance company  including minimum levels of capital and surplus and establishing reserves 
state regulatory authorities monitor the stability and service of insurance companies and possess broad powers with respect to the licensing of title insurers and agents  approving rate schedules and policy forms  financial reporting and accounting practices  reserve requirements  investments and dividend restrictions  as well as examinations and audits of title insurers 
both itic and ne itic meet the statutory premium reserve requirements and the minimum capital and surplus requirements of the states in which they are licensed 
a substantial portion of the assets of the company s title insurance subsidiaries consists of their portfolios of investment securities 
both of these subsidiaries are required by various states laws to maintain assets of a defined quality and amount 
the company s two insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination at any time by the insurance regulators in the states where they are licensed 
these and other governmental authorities have the power to enforce state and federal laws to which the title insurance subsidiaries are subject  including but not limited to  the real estate settlement procedures act respa 
the united states department of housing and urban development hud published final rules regarding respa on november  the new rules became effective on january  among other reforms  these new rules require lenders and mortgage brokers to provide consumers with a standard good faith estimate that more clearly discloses loan terms and closing costs  including title insurance premiums and charges  and facilitates comparison shopping by home buyers 
hud has also indicated that it intends to seek legislative changes to respa that will complement the rules and provide hud with enforcement mechanisms for some of the most important consumer disclosures and protections 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing insurance holding companies and the title insurance industry are often introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various insurance regulatory agencies 
the company regularly monitors such proposals and legislation  although the likelihood and timing of them and the impact they may have on the company and its subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time 
any material change in the company s regulatory environment may have an adverse effect on its business 
exchange services intermediary services are not federally regulated by any regulatory commissions  and neither itec nor itac operate in any states that regulate this industry 
itec and itac both provide services to taxpayers pursuant to irs regulations that provide taxpayers a safe harbor by using a qualified intermediary to structure tax deferred exchanges of property and using an exchange accommodation titleholder to hold property in reverse exchange transactions 
investment management and trust services investors trust is regulated by the north carolina commissioner of banks 
competition title insurance the title insurance industry is highly competitive 
itic s and ne itic s major competitors together comprise a majority of the title insurance market on a national level 
the number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which the company conducts business 
key factors that affect competition in the title insurance industry are timeliness and quality of service  price  expertise and the financial strength and size of the insurer 
title insurance underwriters also compete for agents based upon service and commission levels 
some title insurers currently have greater financial resources  larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and related information than the company 
in addition  there are numerous industry related regulations and statutes that set out conditions and requirements to conduct business 
changes to or the removal of such regulations and statutes could result in additional competition from alternative title insurance products or new entrants into the industry that could materially affect the company s business operations and financial condition 
exchange services competition for itec and itac comes from other title insurance companies and agents  banks  attorneys  and other independently owned qualified intermediaries that offer exchange services 
key elements that affect competition are price  expertise  timeliness and quality of service and the financial strength and size of the company 
exchange services are not a regulated industry  there is no market data available regarding the company s market position in this industry 
customers the company is not dependent upon any single customer or a few customers  and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
investment policies the company and its subsidiaries derive a substantial portion of their income from investments in bonds municipal and corporate and equity securities 
the company s investment policy is designed to maintain a high quality portfolio and maximize income 
the company invests primarily in short term investments  federal and municipal governmental securities and investment grade debt securities and equity securities 
some state laws impose restrictions upon the types and amounts of investments that can be made by the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the company manages its investment portfolio and does not utilize third party investment managers 
the securities in the company s portfolio are subject to economic conditions and normal market risks 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for the major categories of investments  scheduled maturities  amortized cost  market values of investment securities and earnings by category 
environmental matters the title insurance policies itic and ne itic currently issue exclude any liability for environmental risks and contamination 
although policies issued prior to may not specifically exclude such environmental risks  they generally do not provide affirmative coverage for such risks 
as a result  the company has not experienced and does not anticipate that it or its subsidiaries will incur any significant expenses related to environmental claims 
in connection with effecting tax deferred exchanges of like kind property  itec and itac may temporarily hold title to property pursuant to an accommodation titleholder agreement 
in such situations  the person or entity for which title is being held must execute an indemnification agreement pursuant to which it agrees to indemnify itec or itac  as appropriate  for any environmental or other claims which may arise as a result of the arrangement 
employees the company has no paid employees 
officers of the company are full time paid employees of itic

item a 
risk factors the risk factors listed in this section and other factors noted herein could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
the company s results of operations and financial condition are subject to cyclical demand for title insurance  which depends upon the volume of residential and commercial real estate transactions and mortgage refinancing transactions and economic factors 
the demand for the company s title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services varies over time and from year to year and is dependent upon  among other things  the volume of commercial and residential real estate transactions and mortgage refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as the state of the overall economy  the availability of mortgage financing and mortgage interest rates 
during an economic downturn or recession  such as current conditions in the united states  or when the availability of mortgage financing is limited or mortgage interest rates are increasing  real estate activity typically declines 
the cyclical nature of the company s business has caused fluctuations in revenue and profitability in the past and is expected to do so in the future 
the real estate and credit markets have been experiencing significant volatility and disruption for more than months 
the value of residential real estate property and the volume of new and existing home sales have significantly declined since the market peak in if the current levels of real estate and credit market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience adverse effects  which may be material  to its results of operations 
the overall demand for title insurance also depends in part upon the requirement by mortgage lenders and participants in the secondary mortgage market that title insurance policies be obtained on residential and commercial real property 
the company may experience material losses resulting from fraud  defalcation or misconduct 
fraud  defalcation  regulatory noncompliance and other misconduct by the company s agents  approved attorneys and employees are risks inherent in the company s business 
agents and approved attorneys typically handle large sums of money in trust pursuant to the closing of real estate transactions and misappropriation of funds by any of these parties could result in large title claims 
the company has recently experienced an increase in its level of fraud related losses 
if current economic conditions remain poor or deteriorate further  the company may continue to experience increases in the incidence of fraud  defalcation and misconduct  which may have a material adverse effect on it 
differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions may adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s net income is affected by the extent to which its actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used in establishing reserves for claims 
reserves for claims are established based on actuarial estimates of how much the company will need to pay for reported as well as incurred  but not yet reported claims 
in addition  management considers factors such as the company s historical claims experience  case reserve estimates on reported claims  large claims and other relevant factors in determining loss provision rates and the aggregate recorded expected liability for claims 
due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of reserves for claims  the company cannot determine precisely the amounts which it will ultimately pay to settle its claims 
such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
to the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions used in establishing such liabilities  the company could be required to increase reserves 
title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and may involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure  and therefore  reserve estimates are subject to variability 
in addition  the company may experience unexpected large losses periodically which require it to increase its title loss reserves 
poor economic conditions can lead to increased incidences of title insurance claims  and consequently losses  due to increases in defaults and foreclosures upon insured properties 
the company has experienced an increase in the incidence of title claims and losses during the recent economic downturn 
if the current environment continues or deteriorates further  the company may continue to experience increased levels of claims and losses  which may have a material negative effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
exposure to mechanic lien claims increases during periods of declining home sales 
the ongoing and significant decline in new home sales has led to an increase in mechanic liens being filed for unpaid construction work 
frequently  these liens do not appear in the public record until significant time has lapsed from when the work was performed 
in many jurisdictions  these liens have priority as of the date work commenced  therefore  making it difficult for title insurance companies to underwrite 
this hidden risk can cause significant increases in claims during periods of declining new home sales 
in the recent economic downturn  the company has experienced increased claims and losses related to this particular risk 
although it has implemented procedures to mitigate against this risk in the future  claims and losses related to this risk under existing policies may continue to increase if current economic conditions continue or deteriorate further 
a decline in the performance of the company s investments could materially adversely affect net income and cash flows 
changes in general economic conditions  interest rates  activities in securities markets and other external factors could adversely affect the value of the company s investment portfolio and  in turn  the company s operating results and financial condition 
recent declines in the capital markets have adversely affected the company s investment portfolio  resulting in declines in the sale value and liquidity of securities 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to complex government regulations 
the company s title insurance businesses are subject to extensive state laws and regulations by state insurance authorities in each state in which they operate 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended for the protection of policyholders and consumers 
the nature and extent of these laws and regulations typically involve  among other matters  licensing and renewal requirements and trade and marketing practices  including  but not limited to licensing of insurers and agents  capital and surplus requirements  approval of premium rates for insurance  limitations on types and amounts of investments  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company  deposits of securities for the benefit of policy holders  filing of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition  approval of policy forms  and regulations regarding the use of personal information 
these laws and regulations are subject to change and may restrict the company s ability to implement rate increases or other actions that it may want to take to enhance its operating results or have a negative impact on its ability to generate revenue and earnings 
some of the company s other businesses operate within state and federal guidelines 
any changes in the applicable regulatory environment or changes in existing regulations could restrict its existing or future operations 
revenues from the company s exchange services segment are closely related to the tax rate on capital gains and other provisions in the internal revenue code 
the company s revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond its control 
in addition  the investment management and trust services division is regulated by the north carolina commissioner of banks 
competition in the company s business affects its revenues 
the title insurance industry is highly competitive 
key factors that affect competition in the title insurance business are quality of service  price within regulatory parameters  expertise  timeliness and the financial strength and size of the insurer 
title companies compete for premiums by choosing various distribution channels which may include company owned operations and issuing agency relationships with attorneys  lenders  realtors  builders and other settlement service providers 
title insurance underwriters compete for agents on the basis of service and commission levels 
some title insurers currently have greater financial resources  larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and information than the company 
the number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which the company operates 
competition among the major providers of title insurance or the acceptance of new alternatives to traditional title products by the marketplace could adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
the company s success relies on its ability to attract and retain key personnel and agents 
competition for skilled and experienced personnel and agents in the company s industry is high 
the company may have difficulty hiring the necessary marketing and management personnel to support any future growth 
the loss of any key employee or the failure of any key employee to perform in their current position could prevent the company from realizing future growth 
also  the company cannot provide assurance that it will succeed in attracting or retaining new agents 
its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in one of the company s financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business 
the competitive positions of insurance companies rely in part on the independent ratings of their financial strength and claims paying ability 
the company s financial strength is subject to continued periodic review by rating agencies 
a significant downgrade in the ratings of either of the company s policy issuing subsidiaries could negatively impact its ability to compete for new business and retain existing business and maintain licenses necessary to operate as title insurance companies in various states 
insurance regulations limit the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to it 
the company is an insurance holding company and has no substantial operations of its own 
the company s ability to pay dividends and meet its obligations is dependent  among other things  on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds to it 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance and other regulations that limit the amount of dividends  loans or advances to it based on the amount of adjusted unassigned surplus and net income and require these subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts of capital  surplus and reserves 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require prior state insurance regulatory approval 
these dividend restrictions could limit the company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders or grow its business 
for further discussion of the regulation of dividend payments and other transactions between affiliates  see liquidity and capital resources under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this report 
the company may encounter difficulties managing growth or technology changes  which could adversely affect its results 
the company has historically achieved revenue growth in part through a combination of developing related new products or services and increasing its market share for existing products 
a portion of the company s growth may be in services or geographic areas with which management is less familiar than with its core business and geographic areas 
the expansion of the company s business  particularly in new services or geographic areas  or significant changes in technology may subject it to associated risks  such as the diversion of management s attention  lack of substantial experience in operating such businesses and a change in competitive position resulting from technology changes 
the company relies upon north carolina for about of its title insurance premiums 
north carolina is the largest source of revenue for the title insurance segment and  in  north carolina based premiums accounted for approximately of premiums earned by the company 
a decrease in north carolina business would negatively impact financial results 
key accounting and information systems are concentrated in a few locations 
the company s corporate headquarters  accounting and technology operations are concentrated in north carolina 
these critical business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters  fire  power shortages and other events beyond the company s control 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of the company s critical business operations or systems could severely affect its ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  there could be a material and adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
failures at financial institutions at which the company deposits funds could adversely affect the company 
the company deposits substantial funds in financial institutions 
these funds include amounts owned by third parties  such as escrow deposits 
should one or more of the financial institutions at which the company maintains deposits fail  there is no guarantee that the company would recover the funds it has deposited  whether through federal deposit insurance corporation coverage or otherwise 
certain provisions of the company s shareholder rights plan may make a takeover of the company difficult 
the company has a shareholders rights plan which could discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to the company s shareholders for their common shares 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties the company owns two adjacent office buildings and property located on the corner of north columbia and west rosemary streets in chapel hill  north carolina  which serve as the company s corporate headquarters

item legal proceedings the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to their business 
in the company s opinion  based on the present status of these proceedings  any potential liability of the company or its subsidiaries with respect to these legal proceedings will not  in the aggregate  be material to the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations

overview title insurance investors title company the company is a holding company that engages primarily in two segments of business title insurance and exchange services 
its primary business activity is the issuance of title insurance through two subsidiaries  investors title insurance company itic and northeast investors title insurance company ne itic  which accounted for of the company s operating revenues in through itic and ne itic  the company underwrites land title insurance for owners and mortgagees as a primary insurer 
title insurance protects against loss or damage resulting from title defects that affect real property 
there are two basic types of title insurance policies one for the mortgage lender and one for the real estate owner 
a lender often requires property owners to purchase title insurance to protect its position as a holder of a mortgage loan  but the lender s title insurance policy does not protect the property owner 
the property owner has to purchase a separate owner s title insurance policy to protect their investment 
when real property is conveyed from one party to another  occasionally there is an undisclosed defect in the title or a mistake or omission in a prior deed  will or mortgage that may give a third party a legal claim against such property 
if a claim is made against real property  title insurance provides indemnification against insured defects 
itic issues title insurance policies through issuing agencies and also directly through home and branch offices 
issuing agents are typically real estate attorneys or subsidiaries of community and regional mortgage lending institutions  depending on local customs and regulations and the company s marketing strategy in a particular territory 
the ability to attract and retain issuing agents is a key determinant of the company s growth in premiums written 
revenues for this segment result from purchases of new and existing residential and commercial real estate  refinance activity and certain other types of mortgage lending such as home equity lines of credit 
volume is a factor in the company s profitability due to the existence of fixed operating costs 
these expenses will be incurred by the company regardless of the level of premiums written 
the resulting operating leverage has historically tended to amplify the impact of changes in volume on the company s profitability 
the company s profitability also depends  in part  upon its ability to manage its investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes or defaults or impairments of assets 
the company s volume of title insurance premiums is affected by the overall level of residential and commercial real estate activity 
in turn  real estate activity is generally affected by a number of factors  including the availability of mortgage credit  the cost of real estate  consumer confidence  employment and family income levels and general united states economic conditions 
another important factor in the level of residential and commercial real estate activity is the effect of changes in interest rates 
according to data published by freddie mac  the annual average year fixed mortgage interest rates in the united states were reported to be  and for the years  and  respectively 
the cyclical nature of the residential and commercial real estate markets and consequently  the land title insurance industry has historically caused fluctuations in revenues and profitability  and it is expected to continue to do so in the future 
additionally  there are seasonal influences in real estate activity and accordingly in revenue levels for title insurers 
exchange services the company s second business segment provides customer services in connection with tax deferred real property exchanges through its subsidiaries  investors title exchange corporation itec and investors title accommodation corporation itac 
itec serves as a qualified intermediary in like kind exchanges of real or personal property under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in its role as qualified intermediary  itec coordinates the exchange aspects of the real estate transaction  and its duties include drafting standard exchange documents  holding the exchange funds between the sale of the old property and the purchase of the new property  and accepting the formal identification of the replacement property within the required identification period 
itac serves as exchange accommodation titleholder in reverse exchanges 
as exchange accommodation titleholder  itac offers a vehicle for accommodating a reverse exchange when the taxpayer must acquire replacement property before selling the relinquished property 
factors that influence the title insurance industry will also generally affect the exchange services industry 
in addition  the services provided by the company s exchange services segment are pursuant to provisions in the internal revenue code 
from time to time  these exchange provisions are subject to review and changes  which may negatively affect the demand for tax deferred exchanges in general  and consequently the revenues and profitability of the company s exchange segment 
other services other operating business segments not required to be reported separately are reported in a category called all other 
other services include those offered by the parent holding company and by its wholly owned subsidiaries  investors trust company investors trust  investors capital management company icmc and investors title management services  inc itms 
in conjunction with investors trust  icmc provides investment management and trust services to individuals  companies  banks and trusts 
itms offers consulting services to clients 
business trends and recent conditions the continued downturn in us economic activity and the ongoing decline in real estate transactions were primary drivers behind the lower premiums written in the title industry in during the real estate boom  many lenders loosened their underwriting guidelines  particularly in the sub prime loan market 
these lower underwriting standards  when combined with new methods of financing loans created a supply of inexpensive credit which led to a build up in mortgage loans to high risk borrowers 
as a result  there has been a substantial increase in loan defaults and mortgage foreclosures 
lenders are now returning to stricter loan underwriting standards  which results in lower overall loan volume 
this lower loan volume has  in turn  resulted in a lower level of title premiums generated in the marketplace 
in addition  the downturn in housing and related mortgage finance industries has contributed to higher claims costs 
an increase in property foreclosures tends to reveal title defects 
a slowing pace of real estate activity also triggers the likelihood of certain types of title claims  such as mechanics liens on newly constructed property 
these factors have historically caused title claims to increase in past real estate market cyclical downturns and the company has experienced such increases during the current downturn 
historically  activity in real estate markets has varied over the course of market cycles in response to evolving economic factors 
the company anticipates that current market conditions  including the sub prime lending crisis  rising foreclosures  weakening home sales and falling home prices  will be primary influences on the company s operations until some stabilization occurs 
operating results can vary from year to year based on cyclical market conditions and do not necessarily indicate the company s future operating results and cash flows 
in addition  the credit market disruptions in resulted in an increase in the company s realized capital losses  which are reflected in net income  and unrealized capital losses  which are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the carrying amount  which approximates fair value  of investments at december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
credit ratings itic has been rated by two independent fannie mae approved financial analysis firms  demotech  inc and lace financial corporation lace  with financial stability ratings of a a double prime and b  respectively 
ne itic s financial stability also has been recognized by demotech  inc and lace with ratings of a a double prime and a  respectively 
according to demotech  title underwriters earning a financial stability rating of a a double prime possess unsurpassed financial stability related to maintaining positive surplus as regards policyholders  regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the title insurance cycle 
a lace rating of a or b indicates that a title insurance company has a strong overall financial condition that will allow it to meet its future claims  and that  generally  the company has good operating earnings  is well capitalized and has adequate reserves 
critical accounting estimates and policies this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s management makes various estimates and judgments when applying policies affecting the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies of the company are discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
following are those accounting estimates and policies considered critical to the company 
reserves for claim losses the total reserve for all reported and unreported losses the company incurred through december  is represented by the reserve for claims of  on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
of that total   was reserved for specific claims  and  was reserved for claims for which the company had no notice 
the company s reserves for claims are established using estimated amounts required to settle claims for which notice has been received reported and the amount estimated to be required to satisfy incurred claims of policyholders which may be reported in the future incurred but not reported  ibnr 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 a provision for estimated future claims payments is recorded at the time policy revenue is recorded 
the company records the claims provision as a percentage of premium income 
by their nature  title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts  vary in number due to economic and market conditions such as an increase in mortgage foreclosures and involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure 
in addition  some claims may require a number of years to settle and determine the final liability for indemnity and loss adjustment expense 
the payment experience may extend for more than twenty years after the issuance of a policy 
events such as fraud  defalcation and multiple property defects can substantially and unexpectedly cause increases in estimates of losses 
due to the length of time over which claim payments are made and regularly occurring changes in underlying economic and market conditions  these estimates are subject to variability 
management considers factors such as the company s historical claims experience  case reserve estimates on reported claims  large claims  actuarial projections and other relevant factors in determining loss provision rates and the aggregate recorded expected liability for claims 
in establishing reserves  actuarial projections are compared with recorded reserves to evaluate the adequacy of such recorded claims reserves and any necessary adjustments are then recorded in current operations 
as the most recent claims experience develops and new information becomes available  the loss reserve estimate related to prior periods will change to more accurately reflect updated and improved emerging data 
the company reflects any adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the period in which new information principally claims experience becomes available 
the company initially reserves for each known claim based upon an assessment of specific facts and updates the reserve amount as necessary over the course of administering each claim 
loss ratios for earlier years tend to be more reliable than recent policy years as they are more fully developed 
in making loss estimates  management determines a loss provision rate  which it then applies to net premiums written 
there are key assumptions that materially affect the reserve estimates 
the company assumes the aggregate reported liability for known claims and ibnr  in the aggregate  will be comparable to its historical claims experience unless factors  such as loss experience  change significantly 
the factors the company considered for the recently completed fiscal year did not cause any of its key assumptions to change from assumptions used in the immediately preceding period 
also affecting the company s assumptions are large losses related to fraud and defalcation  as these can cause significant variances in loss emergence patterns 
management defines a large loss as one where incurred losses exceed  due to the small volume of large claims  the long tail nature of title insurance claims and the inherent uncertainty in loss emergence patterns  large claim activity can vary significantly between policy years 
the estimated development of large claims by policy year is therefore subject to significant changes as experience develops 
the company has generally followed the same methodology for estimating loss reserves 
the loss provision rate is set to provide for losses on current year policies and to provide for estimated positive or negative development on prior year loss estimates 
management also considers actuarial analyses in evaluating claims reserves 
the actuarial methods used to evaluate reserves are loss development methods  expected loss methods and cape cod methods  all of which are accepted actuarial methods for estimating ultimate losses and  therefore  loss reserves 
in the loss development method  each policy year s paid or incurred losses are projected to an ultimate level using loss development factors 
in the cape cod method  expected losses for one policy year are estimated based on the loss results for the other policy years  trended to the level of the policy year being estimated 
expected loss methods produce more stable ultimate loss estimates than do loss development methods  which are more responsive to the current loss data 
the cape cod method  a special case of the bornhuetter ferguson method  blends the results of the loss development and expected loss methods 
for more recent policy years  more weight is given to the results of the expected loss methods  for older policy years  more weight is given to the loss development method results 
the key actuarial assumptions are principally loss development factors and expected loss ratios 
the selected loss development factors are based on a combination of the company s historical loss experience and title industry loss experience 
expected loss ratios are estimated for each policy year based on the company s own experience and title industry loss ratios 
when updated data is incorporated into the actuarial models  the resulting loss development factors and expected loss ratios will likely change from the prior values 
changes in these values from through have been the result of actual company and industry experience during the calendar year and not changes in assumptions 
if one or more of the variables or assumptions used changed such that the company s recorded loss ratio  or loss provision as a percentage of net title premiums  increased or decreased two loss ratio percentage points  the impact on after tax income for the year ended december   would be as follows 
company management believes that using a sensitivity of two loss percentage points for the loss ratio provides a reasonable benchmark for analysis of the calendar year loss provision of the company based on historical loss ratios by year 
increase in loss ratio of two percentage points  decrease in loss ratio of two percentage points  despite the variability of such estimates  management believes based on historical claims experience and actuarial analysis that the reserves are adequate to cover claim losses resulting from pending and future claims for policies issued through december  the ultimate settlement of policy and contract claims will likely vary from the reserve estimates included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company continually reviews and adjusts its reserve estimates to reflect its loss experience and any new information that becomes available 
there are no known claims that are expected to have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
premiums written and commissions to agents generally  title insurance premiums are recorded and recognized as revenue at the time of closing of the related transaction as the earnings process is then considered complete 
policies or commitments are issued upon receipt of final certificates or preliminary reports with respect to titles 
title insurance commissions earned by the company s agents are recognized as expense concurrently with premium recognition 
valuation and impairment of investments in securities securities for which the company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are reported at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts and other than temporary declines in fair value 
securities held principally for resale in the near term are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair values 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in other income 
securities not classified as either trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  adjusted for other than temporary declines in fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income 
securities are regularly reviewed for differences between the cost and estimated fair value of each security for factors that may indicate that a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other than temporary include the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the company s ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value 
these factors are reviewed quarterly and any material degradation in the prospect for recovery will be considered in the other than temporary impairment analysis 
such reviews are inherently uncertain and the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline in future periods resulting in a realized loss 
the fair values of the majority of the company s investments are based on quoted market prices from independent pricing services 
over the past several months  the company has seen credit market disruption as the result of illiquid markets and widening spreads 
auction rate securities  where quoted market prices are not available and the company relies on discounted cash flow models for valuation purposes  have been particularly affected due to their thinly traded markets 
all of the company s auction rate securities are rated investment grade and are substantially guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises 
management believes these values reasonably reflect the fair value of these securities  but the key assumptions do involve qualitative inputs 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method 
deferred tax asset the company recorded net deferred tax assets at december  and related primarily to reserves for claims  allowance for doubtful accounts and employee benefits 
based upon the company s historical results of operations  the existing financial condition of the company and management s assessment of all other available information  management believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit of these assets will be realized 
results of operations operating revenues operating revenues include net premiums written plus other fee income and exchange services segment income 
investment income and realized investment gains and losses are not included in operating revenues and are discussed separately following operating revenues 
following is a summary of the company s operating revenues 
intersegment eliminations have been netted with each segment  therefore  the individual segment amounts will not agree to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
title insurance   exchange services    all other    title insurance net premiums net premiums written decreased in from and decreased in from during  the decrease was primarily due to the weak housing market and ongoing general declines in real estate activity and volatility and disruption of financial markets 
policies and commitments the volume of business decreased in  as  policies and commitments were issued in  which is a decrease of compared with  policies and commitments issued in in  policies and commitments issued declined compared with  policies and commitments issued in following is a breakdown between branch and agency premiums for the years ended december twelve months ended december  branch    agency    total   title insurance premiums decreased to  in compared with the decrease in was made up of a  decrease in branch premiums and a  decrease in premiums from agency operations 
branch office net premiums branch office net premiums written as a percentage of total net premiums written were   and in  and  respectively 
the decreases since are due to an expansion of the company s agency relationships 
net premiums written from branch operations decreased in compared with and in compared with the decrease in reflects the economic downturn 
of the company s branch locations that underwrite title insurance policies  are located in north carolina  and as a result  branch premiums written primarily represent north carolina business 
agency net premiums agency net premiums written as a percentage of total net premiums written were  and in  and  respectively 
net premiums written from agency operations slightly decreased in compared with and increased in compared with the increase in is primarily due to additional business written by the company s agencies 
the decrease in agency net premiums written in can be attributed to the general slowdown in real estate activity  offset by increasing agency relationships 
following is a schedule of net premiums written in all states where the company s two insurance subsidiaries itic and ne itic currently underwrite title insurance state illinois    kentucky    michigan    new york    north carolina    pennsylvania    south carolina    tennessee    virginia    west virginia    other    direct premiums    reinsurance assumed    reinsurance ceded    net premiums written   exchange services operating revenues from the company s two subsidiaries that provide tax deferred exchange services itec and itac decreased from to and from to demand for tax deferred exchange services has declined significantly due to weak appreciation or actual declines in value for many types of investment property 
the decline in and revenues compared with resulted primarily from decreases in transaction volume and related lower levels of interest spread income earned on exchange fund deposits held by the company due to declines in the average balances of deposits held during in july  the irs finalized its proposed regulations regarding treatment of funds held by qualified intermediaries 
as originally proposed  these rules would have negatively affected the ability of qualified intermediaries to retain a portion of the interest income earned on exchange fund deposits held by the company during exchange transactions  which could have had a material adverse effect upon the profitability of the company s exchange segment 
as adopted however  the new regulations apply only to individual exchange account balances over million 
the regulations have only recently been adopted  and therefore the company has had only limited experience under this new regime  it is possible that these new regulations may have unanticipated consequences on the revenues and profitability of the company s exchange services segment 
other revenues other revenues primarily include investment management fee income  income related to the company s equity method investments and agency service fees  as well as search fee and other ancillary fees 
other revenues increased in and compared with primarily due to increases from investment management fee income generated by the company s trust division and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
other revenues also increased in compared with due to increases in search fee income 
cyclicality and seasonality title insurance title insurance premiums are closely related to the level of real estate activity and the average price of real estate sales 
the availability of funds to finance purchases directly affects real estate sales 
home sales and mortgage lending are highly cyclical businesses 
other factors include mortgage interest rates  consumer confidence  economic conditions  supply and demand  and family income levels 
historically  residential real estate activity has been generally slower in the winter because fewer real estate transactions occur  while the spring and summer are more active 
refinance activity is generally less seasonal  but it is subject to interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in mortgage interest rates  as well as other economic factors  can cause shifts in real estate activity outside of the normal seasonal pattern 
exchange services seasonal factors affecting the level of real estate activity and the volume of title premiums written will also affect the demand for exchange services 
slowing real estate sales led to a decline in average balances of deposits held during the year 
nonoperating revenues investment income and realized gains and losses from investments are included in nonoperating revenues 
investment income the company derives a substantial portion of its income from investments in bonds municipal and corporate and equity securities 
the company s title insurance subsidiaries are required by statute to maintain minimum levels of investments in order to protect the interests of policyholders 
bonds totaling approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  are deposited with the insurance departments of the states in which business is conducted 
in formulating its investment strategy  the company has emphasized after tax income 
investments in marketable securities have increased from company profits 
the investments are primarily in fixed maturity securities and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
the effective maturity of the majority of the fixed income investments is within years 
as new funds become available  they are invested in accordance with the company s investment policy and corporate goals 
securities purchased may include a combination of taxable fixed income securities  tax exempt securities and equities 
the company strives to maintain a high quality investment portfolio 
interest and investment income levels are primarily a function of general market performance  interest rates and the amount of cash available for investment 
investment income was  in compared with  in and  in investment income decreased from to and increased from to the decline in investment income in was due to a decline in the average investment portfolio and lower levels of interest earned on short term funds  as the capital markets experienced significant distress in the second half of the increase in was primarily attributable to increases in the average investment portfolio balance and higher rates of interest earned on short term investments 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the major categories of investments  scheduled maturities  amortized cost  fair values of investment securities and earnings by security category 
net realized gain loss on investments the company s investment policies have been designed to balance multiple investment goals  including  to assure a stable source of income from interest and dividends  protect capital  provide sufficient liquidity to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future and capital appreciation 
dispositions of equity securities at a realized gain or loss reflect such factors as industry sector allocation decisions  ongoing assessments of issuers business prospects and tax planning considerations 
additionally  the amount of net realized investment gains and losses are affected by assessments of securities valuation for other than temporary impairment 
as a result of the interaction of these factors and considerations  net realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly from period to period 
the company generally intends to hold securities in unrealized loss positions until they mature or recover 
however  the company does sell securities under certain circumstances  such as when it has evidence of a significant deterioration in the issuer s creditworthiness 
net realized loss on investments totaled  in net realized gain on the sales of investment securities totaled  and  in and  respectively 
the net loss included impairment charges totaling  on certain equity and fixed income securities in the company s portfolio that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired and net realized losses on sales of investments of  management has determined that the unrealized losses from remaining fixed income and equity securities at december  are temporary in nature 
the net realized gains in and resulted primarily from the sale of equity securities and other investments in the company s investment portfolio 
the securities in the company s portfolio are subject to economic conditions and market risks 
the company considers relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest rate related impairment of a security is other than temporary 
relevant facts and circumstances include the extent and length of time the fair value of an investment has been below cost 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost  the financial condition and prospects of the issuer including credit ratings and analyst reports and macro economic changes 
reviews of the values of securities are inherently uncertain and the value of the investment may not fully recover  or may decline in future periods resulting in a realized loss 
there are a number of risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated  the risk that the company s assessment of an issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the characteristics of that issuer  the risk that information obtained by the company or changes in other facts and circumstances leads management to change its intent to hold the security to maturity or until it recovers in value and the risk that management is making decisions based on misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers 
expenses the company s operating expenses consist primarily of commissions to agents  salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes  provisions for claims and office occupancy and operations 
operating expenses in increased compared with and increased compared with primarily due to increases in the provision for claims 
partially offsetting these increases in were decreases in professional and contract labor fees  commissions to agents and salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes 
following is a summary of the company s operating expenses 
intersegment eliminations have been netted with each segment  therefore  the individual segment amounts will not agree to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
title insurance   exchange services   all other    on a combined basis  loss margin was in and profit margins were and in and  respectively 
title insurance loss profit margin the company s title insurance profit margin varies according to a number of factors  including the volume and type of real estate activity 
loss profit margins for the title insurance segment were  and in  and  respectively 
the net margins for and were primarily affected by the increase in the provision for claims 
commissions agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts 
commissions to agents decreased from to primarily due to decreased premiums from agency operations in and increased from to primarily due to an increasing percentage of premiums originating from agency operations in commission expense as a percentage of net premiums written by agents was  and in  and  respectively 
commission rates vary geographically 
provisions for claims the provision for claims as a percentage of net premiums written was in  in and in the change in the loss provision estimate for calendar year compared with resulted from unfavorable experience for policy year primarily due to two large claims related to fraud and one large mechanic s lien claim totaling in the aggregate approximately million 
in addition  the company incurred unfavorable experience during for claims related to policy year totaling approximately million 
partially offsetting the change in the loss provision estimate for calendar year was favorable experience for policy year because of a reduction in large claim activity 
the change in estimate for calendar year compared with resulted primarily from policy year  which incurred two large claims resulting from mortgage fraud and theft 
the additional loss provision as a result of these two claims  in addition to the company s expected loss provision  was approximately million 
the increase in the loss provision in from the level resulted in approximately million more in reserves than would have been recorded at the lower level 
if material occurrences of mortgage related fraud  mechanic lien claims and other similar types of claims continue  the company s ultimate loss estimates for recent policy years could increase 
lower than expected loss payment experience was the primary reason for the company s loss provision rate in in  there was favorable experience primarily because of a reduction in large claim activity for policy year calendar year also included an increase for policy year due to claims activity late in the calendar year 
management considers the loss provision ratios for  and to be appropriate given the small volume of large claims  the long tail nature of title insurance claims and the inherent uncertainty in title insurance loss emergence patterns 
the provision for claims reflects actual payments of claims  net of recovery amounts  plus adjustments to the specific and incurred but not reported claims reserves  the latter of which are actuarially determined based on historical claims experience 
payments of claims  net of recoveries  were   and  in  and  respectively 
reserves for claims at december   the total reserves for claims were  of that total   was reserved for specific claims  and  was reserved for claims for which the company had no notice 
because of the uncertainty of future claims  changes in economic conditions  and the fact that many claims do not materialize for several years  reserve estimates are subject to variability 
changes in the expected liability for claims for prior periods reflect the uncertainty of the claim environment  as well as the limited predicting power of historical data 
the company continually updates and refines its reserve estimates as current experience develops and credible data emerges 
adjustments may be required as new information develops which often varies from past experience 
movements in the reserves related to prior periods were primarily the result of changes to estimates to better reflect the latest reported loss data  rather than as a result of material changes to underlying key actuarial assumptions or methodologies 
such changes include payments on claims closing during the year  new details that emerge on still open cases that cause claims adjusters to increase or decrease the case reserve and the impact that these types of changes have on the company s total loss provision 
salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes were   and  for  and  respectively 
salaries and related costs decreased million  or in compared with the decrease in was primarily due to a decline in bonuses and amounts accrued under employment agreements 
the increase in these costs in was primarily attributable to salary increases and additional personnel costs related to staff hired by investors trust company 
on a consolidated basis  salaries and employee benefits as a percentage of total revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits as a percentage of total revenues in was primarily due to declining revenues outpacing cost reductions 
the title insurance segment s total salaries and employee benefits accounted for  and of total salaries for   and  respectively 
office occupancy and operations overall office occupancy and operations as a percentage of total revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the title insurance segment s total office occupancy and operations expense accounted for  and in  and  respectively  of total office occupancy and operations expense 
premium and retaliatory taxes title insurance companies are generally not subject to state income or franchise taxes 
however  in most states they are subject to premium and retaliatory taxes  as defined by statute 
tax rates and bases vary from state to state 
premium and retaliatory taxes as a percentage of net premiums written were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
professional and contract labor fees professional and contract labor fees for decreased million compared with primarily due to decreases in contract labor fees incurred  associated with investments in infrastructure and technology in other expenses other operating expenses primarily include miscellaneous operating expenses of the trust division and other miscellaneous expenses of the title segment 
these amounts typically fluctuate in relation with transaction volume of the title segment and the trust division 
exchange services the exchange services segment s total operating expenses as a percentage of the company s total expenses were  and for  and  respectively 
the principal operating expenses of this segment are salaries  employee benefits and payroll taxes 
income taxes the benefit for income taxes was  for the year ended december  the income tax benefit in was a result of reflecting a lower effective tax rate  primarily due to an increase in the proportion of tax exempt investment income to pre tax loss 
income tax benefit expense as a percentage of loss earnings before income taxes was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  management discovered certain understatements in the provision for income taxes in its financial statements in and the first three quarters of as a result of certain taxable municipal bonds that had been previously misclassified as tax exempt by the company s custodian bank 
the additional amount of the increase in income taxes in the fourth quarter related to the misclassification was approximately  related to the tax year and approximately  related to the first three quarters of the company monitors the realizability of recognized  impairment and unrecognized losses recorded through december  the company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with those losses will be realized 
however  this determination is a judgment and could be impacted by further market fluctuations 
information regarding the components of the income tax expense and items included in the reconciliation of the effective rate with the federal statutory rate can be found in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net loss income the company reported net loss for of  or per share on a diluted basis 
the company reported net income for of  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to  or per share on a diluted basis  for liquidity and capital resources liquidity although cash flow generated from operating activities declined from to  primarily due to the decrease in net income between periods  cash and cash equivalents at year end increased to approximately million  due mainly to significant cash provided by investing activities for the net increase in cash provided by investing activities for was  in turn  due primarily to significantly reduced purchases of investment securities 
the company s ability to offset reductions in cash provided by operations by reducing securities investments  however  is limited by the need to maintain adequate financial condition  capital and claims paying ability 
due to the company s historical consistent ability to generate positive cash flows from its consolidated operations and investment income  management believes that funds generated from operations will enable the company to adequately meet its current operating needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that future experience will be similar to historic experience  since they are influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment  the company s claims paying ability and its financial strength ratings

the company believes that its significant working capital position and management of operating expenses  along with its product diversification efforts will aid its ability to manage cash resources through declines in the real estate market

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the context of item a  market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial instrument market rates and prices  such as fluctuations in interest rates and prices 
the company s primary exposure to market risk relates to the impact of adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates and equity market prices of its investment portfolio 
increases in interest rates diminish the value of fixed income securities and preferred stock  and decreases in stock market values diminish the value of common stocks held 
the fair value of the majority of marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices for those securities 
corporate oversight the company generates substantial investable funds from its two insurance subsidiaries 
in formulating and implementing policies for investing new and existing funds  the company has emphasized maximizing total after tax return on capital and earnings while ensuring the safety of funds under management and adequate liquidity 
the company s board of directors oversees investment risk management processes 
the company seeks to invest premiums and other income to create future cash flows that will fund future claims  employee benefits and expenses  and earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios 
the board of directors has established specific investment policies that define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including the accountabilities and controls over these activities 
the company may rebalance its existing asset portfolios or change the character of future investments from time to time to manage its exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges 
the company also discusses risk management in various places throughout this annual report on form k  including in item interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
this risk arises from the company s investments in interest sensitive debt securities 
these securities are primarily fixed rate municipal bonds and corporate bonds 
the company does not purchase such securities for trading purposes 
at december   the company had approximately million in fixed rate bonds 
the company manages the interest rate risk inherent in its assets by monitoring its liquidity needs and by targeting a specific range for the portfolio s duration or weighted average maturity 
to determine the potential effect of interest rate risk on interest sensitive assets  the company calculates the effect of a change in prevailing interest rates rate shock on the fair market value of these securities considering stated interest rates and time to maturity 
based upon the information and assumptions the company uses in its calculation  management estimates that a immediate  parallel increase in prevailing interest rates would decrease the net fair market value of its fixed rate debt securities by approximately million 
the selection of a immediate parallel increase in prevailing interest rates should not be construed as a prediction by the company s management of future market events  but rather  to illustrate the potential impact of such an event 
to the extent that actual results differ from the assumptions utilized  the company s rate shock measures could be significantly impacted 
additionally  the company s calculation assumes that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the impact of nonparallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates 
equity price risk the company also holds investments in marketable equity securities  which exposes it to market volatility  as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the sensitivity analysis presented does not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor does it consider additional actions the company may take to mitigate its exposure 
equity price risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in a particular common stock or stock index 
at december   the company had approximately million in common stocks 
equity price risk is addressed in part by varying the specific allocation of equity investments over time pursuant to management s assessment of market and business conditions and ongoing liquidity needs analysis 
the company s largest equity exposure is a decline in the s p  its portfolio of equity instruments is similar to those that comprise this index 
based upon the information and assumptions the company used in its calculation  management estimates that an immediate decrease in the s p of would decrease the net fair value of the company s assets identified above by approximately  the selection of a immediate decrease in the s p should not be construed as a prediction by the company s management of future market events  but rather  to illustrate the potential impact of such an event 
the company s exposure will change as a result of changes in its mix of common stocks 
since this calculation is based on historical performance  projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships will remain stable 
therefore  the results noted above may not reflect the company s actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from such historical relationships
