item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report 
our ability to sell assets and replace revenues generated from any sale of our existing properties depends upon market conditions and numerous uncertainties 
we continue to explore opportunities to generate capital for the ongoing development of our core htl tm business  which may involve the sale of some or all of our exploration  development and production assets in china and the us there can be no assurance that we will sell any such assets nor that any such sale  if and when made  will generate sufficient capital for the ongoing development of our core htl tm business 
our operating revenues and cash flows would likely decrease significantly following the sale of any material portion of our existing producing assets and would likely remain at lower levels until we were able to replace the lost production with production from new properties 
our heavy oil project in canada may be exposed to title risks and aboriginal claims 
we have not obtained title opinions in respect of the athabasca heavy oil leases we acquired from talisman energy and there is a risk that our ownership of those leases may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or interests or undetected claims or interests that could impair our title 
any such impairment could jeopardize our entitlement to the economic benefits  if any  associated with the leases  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and ability to execute our business plans in a timely manner or at all 
aboriginal peoples have claimed aboriginal title and rights to large areas of land in western canada where crude oil and natural gas operations are conducted  including a claim filed against the government of canada  the province of alberta  certain governmental entities and the regional municipality of wood buffalo which includes the city of fort mcmurray  alberta claiming  among other things  aboriginal title to large areas of lands surrounding fort mcmurray where most of the oil sands operations in alberta are located 
such claims  if successful  could affect the title to our heavy oil leases and have a significant adverse effect on our business 
our investment in ecuador may be at risk if the agreement through which we hold our interest in the block project is challenged or cannot be enforced 
we hold our interest in the block heavy oil project in ecuador through a services agreement with petroecuador and its subsidiary petroproduccion 
the agreement is governed by the laws of ecuador 
although the agreement has been translated into english  the official and governing language of the agreement is spanish and if any discrepancy exists between the official spanish version of the agreement and the english translation  the official spanish version prevails 
there may be ambiguities  inconsistencies and anomalies between the official spanish version of the agreement and the english translation that could materially affect how our rights and obligations under the agreement are conclusively interpreted and such interpretations may be materially adverse to our interests 

table of contents the dispute resolution provisions of the block agreement stipulate that disputes involving industrial property including intellectual property and technical or economic issues are subject to international arbitration 
other disputes are subject to resolution through mediation or arbitration in ecuador 
there is a risk that we and the other parties to the block agreement will be unable to agree upon the proper forum for the resolution of a dispute based on the subject matter of the dispute 
there can also be no assurance that the other parties to the block agreement comply with the dispute resolution provisions of the block agreement or otherwise voluntarily submit to arbitration 
government policy in ecuador may change to discourage foreign investment or requirements not currently foreseen may be implemented 
there can be no assurance that our investments and assets in ecuador will not be subject to nationalization  requisition or confiscation  whether legitimate or not  by any authority or body 
while the block agreement contains provisions for compensation and reimbursement of losses we may suffer under such circumstances  there is no assurance that such provisions would effectively restore the value of our original investment 
there can be no assurance that ecuadorian laws protecting foreign investments will not be amended or abolished or that the existing laws will be enforced or interpreted to provide adequate protection against any or all of the risks described above 
there can also be no assurance that the block agreement will prove to be enforceable or provide adequate protection against any or all of the risks described above 
estimates of proved reserves and future net revenue may change if the assumptions on which such estimates are based prove to be inaccurate 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment and the assumptions used regarding prices for oil and natural gas  production volumes  required levels of operating and capital expenditures  and quantities of recoverable oil reserves 
oil prices have fluctuated widely in recent years 
volatility is expected to continue and price fluctuations directly affect estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues 
actual prices  production  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil reserves will vary from those assumed in our estimates  and these variances may be significant 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding future oil prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from the estimates we report 
in addition  actual results of drilling  testing and production and changes in natural gas and oil prices after the date of the estimate may result in revisions to our reserve estimates 
revisions to prior estimates may be material 
no reserves have yet been established in respect of our htl tm projects in canada and ecuador 
no reserves have yet been established in respect of our athabasca heavy oil project in canada or our block project in ecuador 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves  including many factors beyond our control and no assurance can be given that any level of reserves or recovery thereof will be realized 
in general  estimates of reserves are based upon a number of assumptions made as of the date on which the estimates were determined  many of which are subject to change and are beyond our control 
information in this document regarding our future plans reflects our current intent and is subject to change 
we describe our current exploration and development plans in this annual report 
whether we ultimately implement our plans will depend on availability and cost of capital  receipt of htl tm technology process test results  additional seismic data or reprocessed existing data  current and projected oil or gas prices  costs and availability of drilling rigs and other equipment  supplies and personnel  success or failure of activities in similar areas  changes in estimates of project completion costs  our ability to attract other industry partners to acquire a portion of the working interest to reduce costs and exposure to risks and decisions of our joint working interest owners 
we will continue to gather data about our projects and it is possible that additional information will cause us to alter our schedule or determine that a project should not be pursued at all 
you should understand that our plans regarding our projects might change 
our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain our interests in licenses  leases and production sharing contracts 
some of our properties are held under licenses and leases  working interests in licenses and leases or production sharing contracts 
if we fail to meet the specific requirements of the instrument through which we hold our interest  it may terminate or expire 
we may not be able to meet any or all of the obligations required to maintain our interest in each such license  lease or production sharing contract 
some of our property interests will terminate unless we fulfill such obligations 
if we are unable to satisfy these obligations on a timely basis  we may lose our rights in these properties 
the termination of our interests in these properties may harm our business 

table of contents we may incur significant costs on exploration or development efforts which may prove unsuccessful or unprofitable 
there can be no assurance that the costs we incur on exploration or development will result in an economic return 
we may misinterpret geologic or engineering data  which may result in significant losses on unsuccessful exploration or development drilling efforts 
we bear the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to unexpected geologic conditions  equipment failures  equipment delivery delays  accidents  adverse weather  government and joint venture partner approval delays  construction or start up delays and other associated risks 
such risks may delay expected production and or increase costs of production or otherwise adversely affect our ability to realize an acceptable level of economic return on a particular project in a timely manner or at all 
our business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may not protect us against all these risks 
there are hazards and risks inherent in drilling for  producing and transporting oil and gas 
these hazards and risks may result in loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims  and other damage to our properties and third parties and include fires  natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  explosions  encountering formations with abnormal pressures  encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations  blowouts  cratering  unexpected operational events  equipment malfunctions  pipeline ruptures  spills  compliance with environmental and government regulations and title problems 
we are insured against some  but not all  of the hazards associated with our business  so we may sustain losses that could be substantial due to events that are not insured or are underinsured 
the occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not carry business interruption insurance and  therefore  the loss and delay of revenues resulting from curtailed production are not insured 
changes to laws  regulations and government policies in canada or ecuador could adversely affect our ability to develop our htl tm projects 
our htl tm projects in canada and ecuador are subject to substantial regulation relating to the exploration for  and the development  production  upgrading  marketing  pricing  taxation  and transportation of bitumen and heavy oil and related products and other matters  including environmental protection 
legislation and regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions 
the exercise of discretion by governmental authorities under existing legislation and regulations  the implementation of new legislation or regulations or the amending of existing legislation and regulations affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry generally could materially increase the costs of developing these projects and could have a material adverse impact on our business 
there can be no assurance that laws  regulations and government policies relevant to these projects will not be changed in a manner which may adversely affect our ability to develop and operate them 
failure to obtain all necessary permits  leases  licenses and approvals  or failure to obtain them on a timely basis  could result in delays or restructuring of the projects and increased costs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
construction  operation and decommissioning of these projects will be conditional upon the receipt of necessary permits  leases  licenses and other approvals from applicable governmental and regulatory authorities 
the approval process can involve stakeholder consultation  environmental impact assessments  public hearings and appeals to tribunals and courts  among other things 
an inability to secure local and regional community support could result in the necessary approvals being delayed or stopped 
there is no assurance such approvals will be issued  or if granted  will not be appealed or cancelled or will be renewed upon expiry or will not contain terms and conditions that adversely affect the final design or economics of the projects 
complying with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact our production 
our operations are governed by numerous laws and regulations at various levels of government in the countries in which we operate 
oil sands and heavy oil extraction  upgrading and transportation operations are subject to extensive regulation and various approvals are required before such activities may be undertaken 
we are subject to laws and regulations that govern the operation and maintenance of our facilities  the discharge of materials into the environment and other environmental protection issues 
these laws and regulations may  among other potential consequences  require that we acquire permits before commencing drilling  restrict the substances that can be released into the environment with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas  require that reclamation measures be taken to prevent pollution from former operations  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells and remediating contaminated soil and groundwater and require remedial measures be taken with respect to property designated as a contaminated site 

table of contents under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injury  clean up costs and other environmental and property damages  as well as administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we maintain limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages as well as environmental damage that occurs over time 
however  we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability of environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost 
accordingly  we could be liable  or could be required to cease production on properties  if environmental damage occurs 
the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the future may harm our business 
furthermore  future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur that result in stricter standards and enforcement  larger fines and liability  and increased capital expenditures and operating costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
no assurance can be given with respect to the impact of future environmental laws or the approvals  processes or other requirements thereunder on our ability to develop or operate our projects in a manner consistent with our current expectations 
canada is a signatory to the united nations framework convention on climate change and has ratified the kyoto protocol  which requires signatory nations to reduce their nation wide emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 
any significant extraction or upgrading operations we may undertake in respect of our htl tm project in canada are likely to produce certain greenhouse gases 
the details of the implementation of a federal greenhouse gas reduction program in canada have not been finalized and it is premature to predict what impact changes to canadian federal or provincial regulations will have on the canadian oil and natural gas industry  but if  and when we develop and operate our htl tm project in canada  we expect that we will face increased capital and operating costs in order to comply with greenhouse gas emissions targets and or reductions  which may be material 
there is no assurance that any mandatory emission intensity reductions to which we may become subject will be technically and economically feasible to implement 
failure to meet any such requirements or successfully engage alternative compliance mechanisms such as emissions credits could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and operate the project 
we compete for oil and gas properties with many other exploration and development companies throughout the world who have access to greater resources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment in which we compete with other exploration and development companies to acquire a limited number of prospective oil and gas properties 
many of our competitors are much larger than we are and  as a result  may enjoy a competitive advantage in accessing financial  technical and human resources 
they may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial  technical and human resources permit 
our principal shareholder may significantly influence our business 
as at the date of this annual report  our largest shareholder  robert m 
friedland  owned approximately of our common shares 
as a result  he has the voting power to significantly influence our policies  business and affairs and the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all  or substantially all  of our assets 
in addition  the concentration of our ownership may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control that otherwise could result in a premium in the price of our common shares 
if we lose our key management and technical personnel  our business may suffer 
we rely upon a relatively small group of key management personnel 
given the technological nature of our business  we also rely heavily upon our scientific and technical personnel 
our ability to implement our business strategy may be constrained and the timing of implementation may be impacted if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel 
we do not maintain any key man insurance 
we do not have employment agreements with certain of our key management and technical personnel and we cannot assure you that these individuals will remain with us in the future 
an unexpected partial or total loss of their services would harm our business 

table of contents development of our heavy oil projects in canada and ecuador will require the recruitment and retention of experienced employees 
we compete with other companies to recruit and retain the limited number of individuals who possess the requisite skills and experience in the particular areas of expertise that are relevant to our business 
this competition exposes us to the risk that we will have to pay increased compensation to such employees or increase the company s reliance and associated costs from partnering or outsourcing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that all of the employees with the necessary abilities and expertise we require will be available 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we have no unresolved staff comments from the sec staff regarding our periodic or current reports filed under the act 
item legal proceedings the company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed november  in the us district court for the district of colorado by jack j 
grynberg and three affiliated companies that alleges bribery and other misconduct and challenges the propriety of a contract awarded to the company s wholly owned subsidiary ivanhoe energy ecuador inc to develop ecuador s pungarayacu heavy oil field 
the plaintiff s claim is for unspecified damages or ownership of the company s interest in the pungarayacu field 
the action is at an early stage and the parties are preparing their defense 
all defendants have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction 
while the company intends to rigorously defend the interest of the company and its shareholders  the likelihood of any ultimate loss or gain  if any  is not determinable at this time

exemptions from certain nasdaq marketplace rules nasdaq s marketplace rules permit foreign private issuers to follow home country practices in lieu of the requirements of certain marketplace rules  including the requirement that an issuer s independent directors hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present 
applicable canadian rules pertaining to corporate governance require us to disclose in our management proxy circular  on an annual basis  our corporate governance practices  including whether or not our independent directors hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present  but there is no legal requirement in canada for independent directors to hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present 
although our non management directors hold meetings from time to time as and when considered necessary or desirable by the independent lead director  such meetings are not regularly scheduled 
enforceability of civil liabilities we are a company incorporated under the laws of the yukon territory of canada and our executive offices are located in british columbia  canada 
some of our directors  controlling shareholders  officers and representatives of the experts named in this annual report on form k reside outside the us and a substantial portion of their assets and our assets are located outside the us as a result  it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the us upon the directors  controlling shareholders  officers and representatives of experts who are not residents of the us or to enforce against them judgments obtained in the courts of the us based upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws or other laws of the us there is doubt as to the enforceability in canada against us or against any of our directors  controlling shareholders  officers or experts who are not residents of the us  in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts  of liabilities based solely upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
therefore  it may not be possible to enforce those actions against us  our directors  officers  controlling shareholders or experts named in this annual report on form k 
holders of common shares as at december   a total of  of our common shares were issued and outstanding and held by holders of record with an estimated  additional shareholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts 

table of contents dividends we have not paid any dividends on our outstanding common shares since we were incorporated and we do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future 
the declaration of dividends on our common shares is  subject to certain statutory restrictions described below  within the discretion of our board of directors based on their assessment of  among other factors  our earnings or lack thereof  our capital and operating expenditure requirements and our overall financial condition 
under the yukon business corporations act  our board of directors has no discretion to declare or pay a dividend on our common shares if they have reasonable grounds for believing that we are  or after payment of the dividend would be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of our assets would  as a result of the dividend  be less than the aggregate sum of our liabilities and the stated capital of our common shares 
exchange controls and taxation there is no law or governmental decree or regulation in canada that restricts the export or import of capital  or affects the remittance of dividends  interest or other payments to a non resident holder of our common shares  other than withholding tax requirements 
there is no limitation imposed by the laws of canada  the laws of the yukon territory  or our constating documents on the right of a non resident to hold or vote our common shares  other than as provided in the investment canada act canada the investment act  which generally prohibits a reviewable investment by an entity that is not a canadian  as defined  unless after review  the minister responsible for the investment act is satisfied that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to canada 
an investment in our common shares by a non canadian who is not a wto investor which includes governments of  or individuals who are nationals of  member states of the world trade organization and corporations and other entities which are controlled by them  at a time when we were not already controlled by a wto investor  would be reviewable under the investment act under two circumstances 
first  if it was an investment to acquire control within the meaning of the investment act and the value of our assets  as determined under investment act regulations  was cdn 
million or more 
second  the investment would also be reviewable if an order for review was made by the federal cabinet of the canadian government on the grounds that the investment related to canada s cultural heritage or national identity as prescribed under the investment act  regardless of asset value 
currently  an investment in our common shares by a wto investor  or by a non canadian at a time when we were already controlled by a wto investor  would be reviewable under the investment act if it was an investment to acquire control and the value of our assets  as determined under investment act regulations  was not less than a specified amount  which for is expected to be cdn 
million 
the investment act provides detailed rules to determine if there has been an acquisition of control 
for example  a non canadian would acquire control of us for the purposes of the investment act if the non canadian acquired a majority of our outstanding common shares 
the acquisition of less than a majority  but one third or more  of our common shares would be presumed to be an acquisition of control of us unless it could be established that  on the acquisition  we were not controlled in fact by the acquirer 
an acquisition of control for the purposes of the investment act could also occur as a result of the acquisition by a non canadian of all or substantially all of our assets 
the canadian federal government has recently brought forth certain proposed amendments the amendments to the investment act 
if adopted as law  the amendments would generally raise the thresholds that trigger governmental review 
specifically  with respect to investors based in wto member nations  the amendments would see the thresholds for the review of direct acquisitions of control increase from the current cdn 
million based on book value to cdn 
million to be based on the enterprise value of the canadian business for the two years after the amendments becomes law  to cdn 
million in the following two years and then to cdn 
billion for the next two years 
thereafter  the threshold is to be adjusted to account for inflation 
the exact specifications of the amendments still require additional definition and details of how they will be implemented 
the amendments  however  represent a significant change to canada s regulation of foreign investment 
amounts that we may  in the future  pay or credit  or be deemed to have paid or credited  to you as dividends in respect of the common shares you hold at a time when you are not a resident of canada within the meaning of the income tax act canada will generally be subject to canadian non resident withholding tax of of the amount paid or credited  which may be reduced under the canada us income tax convention  as amended  the convention 
currently  under the convention  the rate of canadian non resident withholding tax on the gross amount of dividends paid or credited to a us resident is generally 
however  if the beneficial owner of such dividends is a us resident corporation  which owns or more of our voting stock  the withholding rate is reduced to 
in the case of certain tax exempt entities  which are residents of the us for the purpose of the convention  the withholding tax on dividends may be reduced to

table of contents ivanhoe energy s business ivanhoe energy is an independent international heavy oil development and production company focused on pursuing long term growth in its reserve base and production 
ivanhoe energy plans to utilize technologically innovative methods designed to significantly improve recovery of heavy oil resources  including the application of htl tm technology and eor techniques 
in addition  the company seeks to expand its reserve base and production through conventional exploration and production of oil and gas 
our core operations are currently carried out in china  the united states  canada and ecuador  with business development opportunities worldwide 
in mid  the company acquired two leases located in the heart of the athabasca oil sands region in alberta  canada and recently signed a contract in ecuador for the appraisal and development of a heavy oil lease in ecuador 
it is anticipated that these sites will provide for the first commercial applications of the company s htl technology in major  integrated heavy oil projects 
ivanhoe energy s proprietary  patented heavy oil upgrading technology upgrades the quality of heavy oil and bitumen by producing lighter  more valuable crude oil  along with by product energy which can be used to generate steam or electricity 
the htl tm technology has the potential to substantially improve the economics and transportation of heavy oil 
there are significant quantities of heavy oil throughout the world that have not been developed  much of it stranded due to the lack of on site energy  transportation issues  or poor heavy light price differentials 
in remote parts of the world  the considerable reduction in viscosity of the heavy oil through the htl tm process will allow the oil to be transported economically by pipelines 
in addition to a dramatic improvement in oil quality  an htl tm facility can yield large amounts of surplus energy for production of the steam and electricity used in heavy oil production 
the thermal energy from the htl tm process would provide heavy oil producers with an alternative to increasingly volatile prices for natural gas that now is widely used to generate steam 
yields of the low viscosity  upgraded product can be greater than by volume  and high conversion of the heavy residual fraction is achieved 
in addition to the liquid upgraded oil product  a small amount of valuable by product gas is produced  and usable excess heat is generated from the by product coke 
htl tm can virtually eliminate cost exposure to natural gas and diluent  solve the transport challenge  and capture a substantial portion of the heavy to light oil price differential for oil producers 
htl tm accomplishes this at a much smaller scale and at lower per barrel capital costs compared with established competing technologies  using readily available plant and process components 
as htl tm facilities are designed for installation near the wellhead  they eliminate the need for diluent and make large  dedicated upgrading facilities unnecessary 
executive overview of results during the year  the value attributed to our reserves of oil and gas based on a standardized measure of discounted future cash flows decreased by to million of which million is in china and million in the us these values decreased principally as a result of significant year over year decreases in oil prices as at the end of the year of 
total revenues increased as a result of price increases during a portion of the year and a million increase in gains on derivative instruments that were required by the company s bank loan agreements 
general and administrative costs increased as the company continued to invest significant resources in the development and commercial deployment of its patented htl heavy oil upgrading technology 
in addition  in the company made a million provision for impairment of its gtl intangible assets and development costs 
in the second and third quarters of  the company completed three key transactions the acquisition of what we believe to be high quality oil sand assets in the athabasca region of canada our tamarack project  an agreement with the government of ecuador on the development of a major heavy oil block in ecuador pungarayacu  and a cdn 
million equity financing 
with these transactions  the company has taken significant steps towards its transition to a heavy oil exploration  production and upgrading company 
the remainder of was dedicated primarily to formulating the development plans for the tamarack project in alberta and for pungarayacu in ecuador  including advancing the permitting processes 
in addition  the company commissioned and began operating the htl feedstock test facility in san antonio  and continues with htl engineering of commercial scale htl facilities consistent with the development plans for tamarack and pungarayacu 
the company s four reportable business segments are oil and gas integrated  oil and gas conventional  business and technology development and corporate 
these segments are different than those reported in the company s previous financial statements included in its form ks and as such the presentation has been changed to conform to the new segments 
due to newly established geographically focused entities and the initiation of two new integrated projects  new segments are being reported to reflect how management now analyzes and manages the company 

table of contents oil and gas integrated projects in this segment will have two primary components 
the first component consists of conventional exploration and production activities together with enhanced oil recovery techniques such as steam assisted gravity drainage 
the second component consists of the deployment of the htl tm technology which will be used to upgrade heavy oil at facilities located in the field to produce lighter  more valuable crude 
the company has two such projects currently reported in this segment a heavy oil project in alberta and a heavy oil property in ecuador 
the integrated segments were established in and therefore there is no comparative information for and conventional the company explores for  develops and produces crude oil and natural gas in china and in the us in china  the company s development and production activities are conducted at the dagang oil field located in hebei province and its exploration activities are conducted on the zitong block located in sichuan province 
in the us  the company s exploration  development and production activities are primarily conducted in california and texas 
business and technology development the company incurs various costs in the pursuit of htl tm and gtl projects throughout the world 
such costs incurred prior to signing a mou or similar agreement  are considered to be business and technology development and are expensed as incurred 
upon executing a mou to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of a project  including studies for the marketability for the projects products  the company assesses whether the feasibility and related costs incurred have potential future value  are probable of leading to a definitive agreement for the exploitation of proved reserves and should be capitalized 
additionally  the company incurs costs to develop  enhance and identify improvements in the application of the htl tm and gtl technologies it owns or licenses 
the cost of equipment and facilities acquired  or construction costs for such purposes  are capitalized as development costs and amortized over the expected economic life of the equipment or facilities  commencing with the start up of commercial operations for which the equipment or facilities are intended

the decrease in our net loss from to of million was due to an increase of million in combined oil and gas revenues and realized gain on derivative instruments 
these were offset by increases in operating costs of million  a million increase in general and administrative and business and technology development expenses excluding stock based compensation and a million increase in depletion and depreciation 
in addition  there was a million increase in income as a result of unrealized gain on derivative instruments offset by a combined million expense increase arising from the impairment of assets 
our net loss for was million per share compared to our net loss in of million per share 
the increase in our net loss from to of million was due to decrease of million in combined oil and gas revenues and realized loss on derivative instruments  an increase in operating costs of million  a million increase in general and administrative and business and technology development expenses excluding stock based compensation and an million increase in unrealized loss on derivative instruments 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease for depletion and depreciation 
significant variances in our net losses are explained in the sections that follow

oil and gas prices increased per boe in contributing to a million increase in revenue as compared to we realized an average of per boe from operations in china during  which was an increase of per boe from prices and accounted for million of our increase in revenues 
from the us operations  we realized an average of per boe during  which was an increase of per boe and accounted for million of our increased revenues 
we expect crude oil prices and natural gas prices to remain volatile in oil and gas prices increased per boe in generating million in additional revenue as compared to we realized an average of per boe from operations in china during  which was an increase of per boe from prices and accounted for million of our increase in revenues 
from the us operations  we realized an average of per boe during  which was an increase of per boe and accounted for million of our increased revenues 
the increased revenues from higher oil and gas price in and were offset by the realized loss on derivatives resulting from settlements from our costless collar derivative instruments 
as benchmark prices rise above the ceiling price established in the contract the company is required to settle monthly see further details on these contracts below under unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments 
the company realized a net loss on these settlements in of million  million of which was from the us segment  the balance from the china segment 
this compares to a realized net loss in of million and a million realized gain in changes in these realized settlement gains losses by segment are detailed below year ended favorable year ended favorable year ended december  unfavorable december  unfavorable december  variances variances china us operating costs  including windfall levy the windfall levy and production taxes and engineering and support costs  for increased  or  per boe for when compared to these costs increased  or  per boe for when compared to of the total million increase in these costs for compared to  million were a result of the change in windfall levy which is explained in more detail below under the china operating costs section 

table of contents china production volumes vs 
net production volumes during increased by  boe when compared to the normal field decline was offset by the production from five new development wells that were completed and put on production in the second half of  as well as productivity increases from adding new perforations  fracture stimulations and water flood response 
the expected production rates for will be similar to those averaged in  but may be lower than the exit rate at december  at the end of  there were producing wells at the dagang field and producing wells at the end of production volumes vs 
the december  exit production rate at dagang was  gross bopd  compared to  gross bopd at the end of normal field decline was offset by the production of gross bopd from five new development wells completed and put on production in the second half of overall  net production volumes decreased at the dagang field for as in addition to normal declines within the field  we incurred abnormal downtimes due to problems encountered with sub surface equipment 
these equipment issues were resolved with a change in equipment suppliers 
operating costs vs 
operating costs in china  including engineering and support costs and windfall levy  increased or per boe for when compared to field operating costs increased per boe mainly as a result of a higher percentage of field office costs allocated to operations versus capital as capital activity has decreased 
in addition there were more service rig days worked and higher power costs resulting from greater water injection in when compared to these increases were offset by decreases resulting from road access costs  insurance coverage and lower project management salaries 
in march  the ministry of finance of the peoples republic of china prc issued the administrative measures on collection of windfall gain levy on oil exploitation business the windfall levy measures 
according to the windfall levy measures  effective as of march   enterprises exploiting and selling crude oil in the prc are subject to a windfall gain levy if the monthly weighted average price of crude oil is above per barrel 
the windfall levy is imposed at progressive rates from to on the portion of the weighted average sales price exceeding per barrel 
the cost associated with windfall levy has been included in operating costs in our financial statements 
consequently  as oil prices have increased  the amount of the windfall levy also increased significantly  resulting in per boe increase in when compared to we expect operating costs in to decrease on a per barrel basis as compared to the most significant component of the expected decrease in operating expenses will be related to the windfall levy  as oil prices are not expected to reach the same levels in as in addition  there will be a decrease in operating costs due to the ability to charge cnpc for its share of operating costs  as commercial production status  currently then after cost recovery  will commence on january  these increases will be somewhat offset by an increase in office costs allocated to operations as we continue to reduce the number of capital projects 
operating costs vs 
operating costs in china  including engineering and support costs and windfall levy  increased or per boe for when compared to field operating costs increased per boe 
in addition to the excessive down hole maintenance problems mentioned above  which resulted in increased workover and maintenance costs  increased power costs  additional operator salaries and higher supervision charges in relation to reduced volumes contributed to the increase 
the windfall levy resulted in a per boe increase for partially as a result of the being the first full year of the levy and partially due to higher oil prices 
engineering and support costs for increased by per boe or as we reduced the number of capital projects 
us production volumes vs 
there was a increase in us production volume for as compared to the overall changes to the us production volumes were mainly due to the first quarter drilling program at south midway 
in addition  an increase in production in was due to increased steaming in the first two months of and abnormal downtimes in the steaming operations in due the absence of our two steam generators for extended period of time 
the first quarter drilling program at south midway is expected to offset natural declines within this field and to provide additional future drilling locations 
increases at south midway were offset by smaller decreases in our spraberry field in west texas where there was a significant downtime related to down hole leak problems 
as at december   we were producing gross boe d net boe d at south midway compared to gross boe d net boe d as at december  in  we expect production volumes at south midway will decline as there are no plans to drill new wells in this property 
we also expect that production volumes at west texas will continue decline modestly 

table of contents production volumes vs 
as at december   we were producing gross boe d net boe d at south midway compared to gross boe d net boe d as at december  us production volumes decreased in when compared to mainly due to a decline in production at south midway resulting from steam generator downtime during the second and third quarters  along with certain wells taken offline to be soaked and steamed once that steaming operation came back on line 
the purchase of a second steam generator and the retrofit of an existing generator allowed for a full steaming program in in addition to the natural declines in production within our spraberry field in west texas  production was also hampered by a key producer being down for repairs in the third quarter 
operating costs vs 
operating costs in the us  including engineering and support costs and production taxes  increased per boe for when compared to field operating costs increased per boe mainly due to an increase in steaming operations at south midway 
both steam generators were down in the latter part of the first quarter and through the second quarter of in addition  the price of natural gas has been significantly higher in when compared to additional maintenance costs and workovers at the spraberry field in west texas in added to the overall increase in costs 
in addition  oil field expenses in general increased due to the demand both in california and nationwide during typically as oil prices rise so does drilling activity 
the company anticipates the costs associated with the oil service industry to decrease in as demand has decreased 
the expectation for overall operating expense in is otherwise unknown as natural gas prices are expected to remain volatile and the company can not predict the number or extent of workover projects 
operating costs vs 
operating costs in the us  including engineering and support costs and production taxes  increased or per boe for when compared to field operating costs increased per boe due to increases to maintenance costs and workovers at spraberry and steaming projects in the diatomite formation at north salt creek 
these increases were somewhat offset due to a reduction in our south midway steaming operations as we were in the process of replacing a steam generator  including purchasing and subsequent retro fit  which was completed and put on line in the third quarter 
we also had our other steam generator down for repairs during the second quarter 
in addition to this overall increase  engineering and support costs for increased by per boe mainly due to a higher allocation of support to production as capital activity decreased

business and technology development changes in business and technology development costs  before and after considering increases in non cash stock based compensation  for the year ended december  when compared to and for the year ended december  when compared to were as follows business and technology development vs 
business and technology development expenses decreased million including changes in stock based compensation in when compared to  mainly as a result of a decrease in cdf operating costs due to several heavy oil upgrading runs in the first and second quarters of these decreases were offset by increases in compensation costs as the company assembled a core htl tm technology team 

table of contents business and technology development vs 
business and technology development expenses increased million in compared to as we focused on business and technology development activities related to htl tm opportunities 
the overall increase in htl tm related to salaries and benefits was million 
in addition to a reallocation of resources see g a explanations above to htl tm  and discretionary bonuses  key personnel were added to this segment throughout as the company developed its commercialization program for its technology 
this increase was partially offset by an increased million allocation to capital investments 
this segment also increased as a result of million higher operating costs at the cdf 
operating expenses of the cdf to develop and identify improvements in the application of the htl tm technology are a part of our business and technology development activities 
this increase was in part the result of several heavy oil upgrading runs in the first and second quarters of  including a key athabasca bitumen test run 
the company used the information derived from the athabasca bitumen test run for the design and development of full scale commercial projects 
in addition  the htl tm segment increased million as a result of higher outside engineering fees and legal fees related to patents and million due to a shift in resources from gtl 
the remainder of the increase is related to consulting fees and travel costs to develop opportunities for our htl tm technology 
net interest net interest vs 
interest expense increased million for when compared to partially due to an additional draw on our us loan  borrowings under a new loan for our china operations in the fourth quarter of and a short term loan that was outstanding from may to august interest income also increased slightly in when compared to due to cash deposits from the july private placement 
net interest vs 
interest expense was higher in when compared to partially due to an additional draw down on our us loan and the funding of a new loan for china 
these higher amounts were offset by a decrease related to the early pay off of the term note see vs 
analysis below 
in addition  interest income decreased by million as average cash balances were lower throughout when compared to unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments as required by the company s lenders  the company entered into costless collar derivatives to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its south midway property in california and spraberry property in west texas over a two year period starting november and a six month period starting november the derivatives have a ceiling price of  and  per barrel and a floor price of  and  per barrel  respectively  using wti as the index traded on the nymex 
also as a result of a requirement of the company s lenders  the company entered into a costless collar derivative to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its dagang field in china over a three year period starting september this derivative has a ceiling price of per barrel and a floor price of per barrel using the wti as the index traded on the nymex 
the company is required to account for these contracts using mark to market accounting 
as forecasted benchmark prices exceed the ceiling prices set in the contract  the contracts have negative value or a liability 
these benchmark prices reached record highs at the beginning of the third quarter of before steadily declining at the end of the fourth quarter to a level that is the lowest dating back several years 
for the year ended december   the company had million unrealized gains in these derivative transactions 
this compares to an unrealized net loss in of million and million in changes in these unrealized settlement losses and gains by segment are detailed below year ended favorable year ended favorable year ended december  unfavorable december  unfavorable december  variances variances china us depletion and depreciation the primary expense in this classification is depletion of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties in our us and china cost centers over the life of their proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent reserve evaluators 
for more information on how we calculate depletion and determine our proved reserves see critical accounting principles and estimates oil and gas reserves and depletion in this item 
table of contents depletion and depreciation vs 
depletion and depreciation increased million for as compared to this is partially due to a million increase in depreciation of the cdf  increases in depletion rates for china and in the us china china s depletion rate increased per boe for when compared to  resulting in a million increase in depletion expense for the increase in the rates from year to year was mainly due to an impairment of the drilling and completion costs associated with the second zitong exploration well in the fourth quarter of the remaining increase of million was related to increased production 
us the us depletion rate for was per boe compared to per boe for  an increase of per boe resulting in a million increase in depletion expense 
business and technology development depreciation of the cdf is calculated using the straight line method over its current useful life which is based on the existing term of the agreement with aera energy llc to use their property to test the cdf 
a formal study was conducted in whereby the estimated salvage value of the property was decreased and the asset retirement obligation was increased resulting in an increased depreciable base 
depletion and depreciation vs 
depletion and depreciation decreased million in  partially due to reduced depletion of million 
the overall reduction in depletion was mainly the result of lower production rates which resulted in a decrease in depletion of million for this decrease was somewhat offset by a higher depletion rate of per boe which resulted in additional depletion expense of million 
reduced depreciation of the cdf as a result of a longer depreciation period also contributed to the overall decrease in depletion and depreciation in the amount of million for china decreases in production volumes in china resulted in a decrease in depletion expense of million for when compared to china s depletion rate decreased per boe to for when compared to  resulting in a million decrease in depletion expense 
the decrease in the rates from year to year was mainly due to a million ceiling test write down in the fourth quarter of this decrease was somewhat offset by an increase to the depletable pool in the fourth quarter of for the impairment of the drilling costs associated with the second exploration well in the zitong block 
us the us depletion rate for was per boe compared to per boe for  an increase of per boe resulting in a million increase in depletion expense 
this increase was mainly due to the fourth quarter impairment of certain properties  including north yowlumne  lak ranch and catfish creek  resulting in million of those costs being included with our proved properties and therefore subject to depletion 
in addition  the capital spending we incurred in was related to facilities  versus drilling  and therefore did not correspondingly increase our reserve base 
additionally  decreases in production volumes in the us accounted for million of the decrease in depletion expense for business and technology development depreciation of the cdf is calculated using the straight line method over its current useful life which is based on the existing term of the agreement with aera energy llc to use their property to test the cdf 
the end term of this agreement was extended in august from december  to december  and the useful life was extended to coincide with the new term of the agreement 
in addition to the change in life  depreciation expense also decreased as a result of a reduction in the depreciable base during the second quarter of due to a portion of the payment from inpex being applied against those costs 

table of contents provision for impairment of gtl intangible assets and development costs the company has been pursuing a gtl project for an extended period of time and has not been able to obtain a definitive agreement or appropriate financing 
as a result the company has impaired the entire carrying value of the costs associated with gtl as at december  the carrying value for gtl development costs of million and intangible gtl license costs of million have been reduced to nil with a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 
this impairment does not affect the company s intention to continue to pursue the current gtl project in egypt 
in and  we had no write downs of our gtl assets 
write off of deferred financing costs the company incurred professional fees and expenses associated with the pursuit of corporate financing initiatives by the company s chinese subsidiary  sunwing energy 
in the fourth quarter of this financing initiative was postponed indefinitely and therefore the associated costs were written down to nil with a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 
provision for impairment of oil and gas properties as discussed below in this item in critical accounting principles and estimates impairment of proved oil and gas properties  we evaluate each of our cost center s proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
if as a result of this evaluation  a cost center s carrying value exceeds its expected future net cash flows from its proved and probable reserves then a provision for impairment must be recognized in the results of operations 
impairment of oil and gas properties vs 
we did not impair our oil and gas properties in  compared to million impairment of our china oil and gas properties in impairment of oil and gas properties vs 
we impaired our china oil and gas properties by million in  compared to million in the impairment was mainly the result of impairing our costs incurred in the zitong block due to an unsuccessful second exploration well resulting in those costs of million being included with the carrying value of proved properties for the ceiling test calculation 
the impairment was a result increased operating costs of the dagang field  including cost of the windfall levy established in march financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash net cash and cash equivalents increased by million for the year ended december  compared to a decrease of million for and a decrease of million for operating activities our operating activities provided million in cash for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the same periods in and the increase in cash from operating activities for the year ended december  was mainly due to a increase in oil and gas production prices offset by an increase in expenses  as well as an increase in changes in non cash working capital when compared to the decrease in cash from operating activities for the year ended december  was mainly due to a decrease in net production volumes of offset by an increase in oil and gas prices of  net of realized loss on derivative instruments associated with oil and gas operations 
in addition  increases to operating costs  general and administrative and business and technology development expenses also reduced operating cash flows 
investing activities our investing activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in and million for for  the main reason for the differences is the million paid as part of the cost of the acquisition of the working interests in two leases located in the athabasca oil sands region in the province of alberta  canada see note in the accompanying financial statements for more details 
in addition the company received million in proceeds from the sale of assets and a recovery of development costs in  compared to nil in and million in proceeds from asset sales in there was also a decrease in capital asset expenditures of million for as compared to and increase of million for when compared to

in  the overall focus has been on delineation activities  engineering and pre filing regulatory requirements 
ecuador the increase in of million of investment activities is due to a new project s activities related to the signing of a contract to explore and develop ecuador s pungarayacu heavy oil field using our htl tm upgrading technology 
china the decrease in investment in china in compared to was the result of a million decrease in capital spending at zitong and a million decrease in capital spending at dagang 
spending at zitong during was limited to expenditures relating to the commencement of the second phase of the exploration program which were relatively minor compared to the drilling and completion costs incurred during for completing the first phase of the program which was concluded in december at dagang  we spud five new development wells in compared to where we only completed a series of fracture stimulation projects 
the increase from to was the result of a million increase at our zitong project and million increase for the five new wells in at our dagang project 
us the million increase in us capital spending in compared to was mainly due to the eight well drilling program at south midway in compared to the cost of a new steam generator in this amount was offset by a decrease in cash inflows from asset sales of million in the us in  compared to million for the same period in when we had a ten well drilling program at south midway 
business and technology development the decrease in capital spending during when compared to was due to the timing of costs relating to the construction and delivery of the feedstock test facility ftf 
the increase of million  when comparing to  resulted from expenditures for the ftf increasing by million which were offset by decreased expenditures of million for the cdf and million for gtl and million for other capitalized development costs 
financing activities financing activities for the year ended december  consisted mainly of an equity private placement in the third quarter of in july  the company completed a cdn 
million private placement consisting of  special warrants special warrants at cdn 
per special warrant the offering 
each special warrant entitled the holder to one common share of the company upon exercise of the special warrant 
in august  all of the special warrants were exercised for  common shares 
the net proceeds from the offering of the special warrants was approximately cdn 
million 

table of contents in addition  in april  the company obtained a loan from a third party finance company in the amount of cdn 
million bearing interest at per annum 
at the lender s option the principal and accrued and unpaid interest was converted in august into the company s common shares at a conversion price of cdn 
per share 
these cash inflows were offset by million in professional fees and expenses associated with the pursuit of corporate financing initiatives by the company s chinese subsidiary  sunwing energy and the payment at maturity on december  of a promissory note to talisman in the principal amount of cdn 
million plus accrued interest 
financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of three draws totaling million million net of financing costs on two separate loan facilities 
this increase in borrowings was offset by scheduled debt payments of million 
in  we repaid notes in the amount of million prior to maturity  made scheduled repayments of long term debt of million offset by an initial draw on a bank loan facility of million million net of financing costs 
financing activities in also consisted of million received from the exercise of warrants compared to when there were no warrants exercised but there was a million private placement of common shares 
in april  the company closed a private placement of million special warrants at per special warrant for a total of million 
each special warrant entitled the holder to receive  at no additional cost  one common share and one common share purchase warrant 
all of the special warrants were subsequently exercised for common shares and common share purchase warrants 
each common share purchase warrant originally entitled the holder to purchase one common share at a price of per share until the fifth anniversary date of the closing 
in september  these warrants were listed on the tsx and the exercise price was changed to cdn 
outlook for our capital program budget ranges from approximately million to million and will encompass the following a continuing development of our existing producing oil and gas properties to maximize near term cash flow  b the preparation of tamarack and pungarayacu for development  and c engineering and development costs related to the preparation of our proprietary htl tm oil upgrading technology for full scale deployment in canada and ecuador 
management s plans for financing its requirements and beyond include the potential for alliances or other arrangements with strategic partners as well as traditional project financing  debt and mezzanine financing or the sale of equity securities 
discussions with potential strategic partners are focused primarily on national oil companies and other sovereign or government entities from asian and middle eastern countries that have approached the company and expressed interest in participating in the company s heavy oil activities in ecuador  canada and around the world 
the company intends to utilize revenue from existing operations to fund the continuing transition of the company to a heavy oil exploration  production and upgrading company and non heavy oil related investments in our portfolio will be leveraged or monetized to capture value and provide maximum return for the company 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into one or more alternative business alliances with other parties or raise additional capital 
if we are unable to enter into such business alliances or obtain adequate additional financing  we will be required to curtail our operations  which may include the sale of assets 
in addition to tamarack and pungarayacu  the company will continue to pursue ongoing discussions related to other htl heavy oil opportunities in canada  latin america  the middle east and north africa

critical accounting principles and estimates our accounting principles are described in note to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap in canada  which conform in all material respects to us gaap except for those items disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for us readers  we have detailed the differences and have also provided a reconciliation of the differences between canadian and us gaap in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  revenue recognition  fair market value of derivatives  allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
full cost accounting we follow accounting guideline oil and gas accounting full cost acg in accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all exploration and development costs associated with lease and royalty interest acquisition  geological and geophysical activities  carrying charges for unproved properties  drilling both successful and unsuccessful wells  gathering and production facilities and equipment  financing  administrative costs directly related to capital projects and asset retirement costs are capitalized on a country by country cost center basis 
as at december   the carrying values of our canada  ecuador  china and the us cost centers were million  million  million and million  respectively 
the other generally accepted method of accounting for costs incurred for oil and gas properties is the successful efforts method 
under this method  costs associated with land acquisition and geological and geophysical activities are expensed in the year incurred and the costs of drilling unsuccessful wells are expensed upon abandonment 
as a consequence of following the full cost method of accounting  we may be more exposed to potential impairments if the carrying value of a cost center s oil and gas properties exceeds its estimated future net cash flows than if we followed the successful efforts method of accounting 
impairment may occur if a cost center s recoverable reserve estimates decrease  oil and natural gas prices decline or capital  operating and income taxes increase to levels that would significantly affect its estimated future net cash flows 
see impairment of proved oil and gas properties below 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of reserves is inherently uncertain and complex 
it requires significant judgments and decisions based on available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 
our reserve estimates are based on current production forecasts  prices and economic conditions 
reserve numbers and values are only estimates and you should not assume that the present value of our future net cash flows from these estimates is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 

table of contents reserve estimates are critical to many accounting estimates and financial decisions including determining whether or not an exploratory well has found economically recoverable reserves 
such determinations involve the commitment of additional capital to develop the field based on current estimates of production forecasts  prices and other economic conditions 
calculating our unit of production depletion rates 
proved reserves are used to determine rates that are applied to each unit of production in calculating our depletion expense 
in  oil and gas depletion of million was recorded in depletion and depreciation expense 
if our reserve estimates changed by  our depletion and depreciation expense for would have changed by approximately million assuming no other changes to our reserve profile 
see depletion below 
assessing our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
estimated future net cash flows used to assess impairment of our oil and gas properties are determined using proved and probable reserves 
see impairment of proved oil and gas properties below 
management is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and preparing related disclosures 
estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with sec requirements  generally accepted industry practices in the us as promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers  and the standards of the coge handbook modified to reflect sec requirements 
independent qualified reserves evaluators prepare reserve estimates for each property at least annually and issue a report thereon 
the reserve estimates are reviewed by our engineers who are familiar with the property and by our operational management 
our ceo and cfo meet with our operational personnel to review the current reserve estimates and related disclosures and upon their review and approval present the independent qualified reserves evaluators reserve reports to our board of directors with a recommendation for approval 
our board of directors has approved the reserve estimates and related disclosures 
the estimated discounted future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves included in the supplementary financial information are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows will also be affected by factors such as actual production levels and timing  and changes in governmental regulation or taxation  and may differ materially from estimated cash flows 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reservoirs are considered proved if economic recoverability is supported by either actual production or a conclusive formation test 
probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less likely to be recovered than proved reserves 
it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves 
depletion as indicated previously  our estimate of proved reserves are critical to calculating our unit of production depletion rates 
another critical factor affecting our depletion rate is our determination that an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties has occurred 
costs incurred on an unproved oil and gas property are excluded from the depletion rate calculation until it is determined whether proved reserves are attributable to an unproved oil and gas property or upon determination that an unproved oil and gas property has been impaired 
an unproved oil and gas property would likely be impaired if  for example  a dry hole has been drilled and there are no firm plans to continue drilling on the property 
also  the likelihood of partial or total impairment of a property increases as the expiration of the lease term approaches and there are no plans to drill on the property or to extend the term of the lease 
we assess each of our unproved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that an unproved oil and gas property has been totally or partially impaired we include all or a portion of the accumulated costs incurred for that unproved oil and gas property in the calculation of our unit of production depletion rate 
as at december   we had million  million  million and million of costs incurred on unproved oil and gas properties in canada  ecuador  china and the us  respectively 
our depletion rate is also affected by our estimates of future costs to develop the proved reserves 
we estimate future development costs using quoted prices  historical costs and trends 
it is difficult to predict prices for materials and services required to develop a field particularly over a period of years with rising oil and gas prices during which there is generally increased competition for a limited number of suppliers 
we update our estimates of future costs to develop our proved reserves on a quarterly basis 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties we evaluate each of our cost centers proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the basis for calculating the amount of impairment is different for canadian and us gaap purposes 

table of contents for canadian gaap  acg requires recognition and measurement processes to assess impairment of oil and gas properties ceiling test 
in the recognition of an impairment  the carrying value of a cost center is compared to the undiscounted future net cash flows of that cost center s proved reserves using estimates of future oil and gas prices and costs plus the cost of unproved properties that have been excluded from the depletion calculation 
if the carrying value is greater than the value of the undiscounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves plus the cost of unproved properties excluded from the depletion calculation  then the amount of the cost center s potential impairment must be measured 
a cost center s impairment loss is measured by the amount its carrying value exceeds the discounted future net cash flows of its proved and probable reserves using estimates of future oil and gas prices and costs plus the cost of unproved properties that have been excluded from the depletion calculation and which contain no probable reserves 
the net cash flows of a cost center s proved and probable reserves are discounted using a risk free interest rate adjusted for political and economic risk on a country by country basis 
the amount of the impairment loss is recognized as a charge to the results of operations and a reduction in the net carrying amount of a cost center s oil and gas properties 
we provided for nil  million and million in a ceiling test impairment for our china cost center for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for us gaap  we follow the requirements of the sec s regulation s x article c for determining the limitation of capitalized costs 
accordingly  the carrying value of a cost center s oil and gas properties cannot exceed the future net cash flows  discounted at  of its proved reserves using period end oil and gas prices and costs plus i the cost of properties that have been excluded from the depletion calculation and ii the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the depletion calculation less iii income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties 
the amount of the impairment loss is recognized as a charge to the results of operations and a reduction in the net carrying amount of a cost center s oil and gas properties 
we provided for million  nil and million in ceiling test impairments for our us cost center for the years ended december   and  respectively  and million  million and million for the years ended december   and for our china cost center 
for canadian gaap  the carrying value includes all capitalized costs for each cost center  including costs associated with asset retirement net of estimated salvage values  unproved properties and major development projects  less accumulated depletion and ceiling test impairments 
this is essentially the same definition according to us gaap  under regulation s x  except that the carrying value of assets should be net of deferred income taxes and costs of major development projects are to be considered separately for purposes of the ceiling test calculation 
asset retirement obligations for canadian gaap  we follow canadian institute of chartered accountants cica section  asset retirement obligations which requires asset retirement costs and liabilities associated with site restoration and abandonment of tangible long lived assets be initially measured at a fair value which approximates the cost a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire such assets 
the fair value is recognized in the financial statements at the present value of expected future cash outflows to satisfy the obligation 
subsequent to the initial measurement  the effect of the passage of time on the liability for the asset retirement obligation accretion expense and the amortization of the asset retirement cost are recognized in the results of operations 
we measure the expected costs required to retire our producing us oil and gas properties at a fair value  which approximates the cost a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to abandon the field and restore the site 
we do not make such a provision for our oil and gas operations in china as there is no obligation on our part to contribute to the future cost to abandon the field and restore the site 
asset retirement costs are depleted using the unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves and are included with depletion and depreciation expense 
the accretion of the liability for the asset retirement obligation is included with interest expense 
for us gaap  we follow sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which conforms in all material respects with canadian gaap 
research and development we incur various expenses in the pursuit of htl tm and gtl projects  including htl tm technology for heavy oil processing  throughout the world 
for canadian gaap  such expenses incurred prior to signing a mou  or similar agreements  are considered to be business and technology development expenses and are charged to the results of operations as incurred 
upon executing a mou to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of a project  including studies for the marketability of the projects products  we assess that the feasibility and related costs incurred have potential future value  are probable of leading to a definitive agreement for the exploitation of proved reserves and should be capitalized 
if no definitive agreement is reached  then the capitalized costs  which are deemed to have no future value  are written down to our results of operations with a corresponding reduction in our investments in htl tm or gtl assets 
for the years ended december   and  we wrote down million  nil and nil  respectively  of capitalized negotiation and feasibility costs associated with our gtl projects which did not result in definitive agreements with no write downs in those same periods related to our htl tm projects 
additionally  we incur costs to develop  enhance and identify improvements in the application of the htl tm and gtl technologies we license or own 
we follow cica section research and development costs in accounting for the development costs of equipment and facilities acquired or constructed for such purposes 
development costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected economic life of the equipment or facilities commencing with the start up of commercial operations for which the equipment or facilities are intended 
we review the recoverability of such capitalized development costs annually  or as changes in circumstances indicate the development costs might be impaired  through an evaluation of the expected future discounted cash flows from the associated projects 
if the carrying value of such capitalized development costs exceeds the expected future discounted cash flows  the excess is written down to the results of operations with a corresponding reduction in the investments in htl tm and gtl assets 

table of contents costs incurred in the operation of equipment and facilities used to develop or enhance htl tm and gtl technologies prior to commencing commercial operations are business and technology development expenses and are charged to the results of operations in the period incurred 
for us gaap  we follow sfas no 
 research and development 
as with canadian gaap  costs of equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities are capitalized as tangible assets and amortized over the expected economic life of the equipment or facilities commencing with the start up of commercial operations for which the equipment or facilities are intended 
however  for us gaap such facilities must have alternative future uses to be capitalized 
as with canadian gaap  expenses incurred in the operation of research and development equipment or facilities prior to commencing commercial operations are business and technology development expenses and are charged to the results of operations in the period incurred 
the major difference for us gaap purposes is that feasibility  marketing and related costs incurred prior to executing a definitive agreement are considered to be research and development costs and are expensed as incurred 
for the years ended december   and  we expensed million  million and million  respectively  of feasibility  marketing and related costs incurred prior to executing definitive agreements 
intangible assets our intangible assets consists of the underlying value of an exclusive  irrevocable license to deploy  worldwide  the rtp tm process for petroleum applications htl tm technology as well as the exclusive right to deploy the rtp tm process in all applications other than biomass and a master license from syntroleum permitting us to use the syntroleum process in an unlimited number of projects around the world 
for canadian gaap  we follow cica section goodwill and other intangible assets whereby intangible assets  acquired individually or with a group of other assets  are initially recognized and measured at cost 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives whereas intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized unless it is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life 
intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value or expected future discounted cash flows  the excess is written down to the results of operations with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
the htl tm technology and the syntroleum gtl master license have finite lives  which correlate with the useful lives of the facilities we expect to develop that will use the technologies 
the amount of the carrying value of the technologies we assign to each facility will be amortized to earnings on a basis related to the operations of the facility from the date on which the facility is placed into service 
we evaluate the carrying values of the htl tm technology and the syntroleum gtl master license annually  or as changes in circumstances indicate the intangible assets might be impaired  based on an assessment of its fair market value 
for us gaap  we follow sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which conforms in all material respects with canadian gaap 
accounting changes on january   the company adopted three new accounting standards that were issued by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica handbook section capital disclosures s  handbook section financial instruments disclosures s  and handbook section financial instruments presentation s 
s 
establishes standards for disclosing information about an entity s capital and how it is managed 
the objective of s 
is to require entities to provide disclosures in their financial statements that enable users to evaluate both the significance of financial instruments for the entity s financial position and performance  and the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed during the period and at the balance sheet date  and how the entity manages those risks 
the purpose of s 
is to enhance financial statement users understanding of the significance of financial instruments to an entity s financial position  performance and cash flows 
the latter two replaced handbook section 
financial instruments disclosure and presentation 
the company adopted the new standards on january  with additional disclosures included in these consolidated financial statements 
there was no transitional adjustment to the consolidated financial statements as a result of having adopted these standards 
impact of new and pending canadian gaap accounting standards in february  the cica issued handbook section  goodwill and intangible assets  s 
replacing handbook section  goodwill and other intangible assets s 
and handbook section  research and development costs 
s 
will be applicable to financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after october  accordingly  the company will adopt the new standards for its fiscal year beginning january  the new section establishes standards for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of goodwill subsequent to its initial recognition and of intangible assets by profit oriented enterprises 
standards concerning goodwill are unchanged from the standards included in the previous s 
management has concluded that the requirements of this new section as they relate to goodwill will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents also in february  the cica amended portions of handbook section  financial statement concepts  which the cica concluded permitted deferral of costs that did not meet the definition of an asset 
the amendments apply to annual and interim financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after october  upon adoption of s 
and the amendments to section on january   capitalized amounts that no longer meet the definition of an asset will be expensed retrospectively 
management has concluded that the requirements of this new section will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company implemented amendments to cica handbook section general standards of financial statement presentation that incorporates going concern guidance 
these changes require management to make an assessment of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern when preparing financial statements 
financial statements shall be prepared on a going concern basis unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading  or has no realistic alternative but to do so 
when management is aware  in making its assessment  of material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity s ability to continue as a going concern  those uncertainties shall be disclosed 
the new requirements are applicable to all entities and are effective for annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after january  there was no material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as the company already going concern disclosure in its consolidated financial statements 
convergence of canadian gaap with international financial reporting standards in april  the cica published the exposure draft adopting ifrss in canada 
the exposure draft proposes to incorporate international financial reporting standards ifrs into the cica accounting handbook effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after january  at this date  publicly accountable enterprises will be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs 
under ifrs  the primary audience is capital markets and  as a result  there is significantly more disclosure required  specifically for quarterly reporting 
further  while ifrs uses a conceptual framework similar to canadian gaap  there are significant differences in accounting policy which must be addressed 
the company has not completed development of its ifrs changeover plan  which will include project structure and governance  deployment of resources and training  analysis of key gaap differences and a phased plan to assess accounting policies under ifrs as well as potential ifrs exemptions 
the company hopes to complete its project scoping  which will include a timetable for assessing the impact on data systems  internal controls over financial reporting  and business activities  such as financing and compensation arrangements  once the exemptions as described below relating to full cost oil and gas companies have been determined 
the international accounting standards board iasb has stated that it plans to issue an exposure draft relating to certain amendments to ifrs in order to make it more useful to canadian entities adopting ifrs for the first time 
one such exemption relating to full cost oil and gas accounting is expected to result in a reduced administrative transition from the current canadian acg to ifrs 
it is anticipated that this exposure draft will not result in an amended ifrs standard until late in the amendment will potentially permit the company to apply ifrs prospectively to its full cost pool  rather than the retrospective assessment of capitalized exploration and development expenses  with the proviso that a ceiling test  under ifrs standards  be conducted at the transition date 
impact of new and pending us gaap accounting standards in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

the new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
it is effective beginning january  management has concluded that the requirements of this recent statement will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as the current policy on accounting for fair value measurements is consistent with this guidance 
the company has  however  provided additional prescribed disclosures not required under canadian gaap 

table of contents in december  the sec released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting to revise the existing regulation s k and regulation s x reporting requirements to align with current industry practices and technological advances 
the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require a company to a disclose its internal control over reserves estimation and report the independence and qualification of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserve audit and c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than period end prices 
the provisions of this final ruling will become effective for disclosures in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  management is currently evaluating the impact of these changes on its financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us  or our related parties  except as disclosed herein 
related party transactions the company has entered into agreements with a number of entities which are related through common directors or shareholders 
these entities provide access to an aircraft  the services of administrative and technical personnel and office space or facilities in vancouver  london and singapore 
the company is billed on a cost recovery basis 
for the year ended december  the costs incurred in the normal course of business with respect to the above arrangements amounted to million million for and million for  and are recorded in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations 
as at december  amounts included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the balance sheet under these arrangements were million million at december  
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to normal market risks inherent in the oil and gas business  including equity market risk  commodity price risk  foreign currency rate risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
we recognize these risks and manage our operations to minimize our exposures to the extent practicable 
non trading equity market risks we currently have limited production in the us and china  which have not generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our exploration and development activities 
historically  we have relied on the equity markets as the primary source of capital to fund our expansion and growth opportunities 
based on our current plans  we estimate that we will need approximately to million to fund our capital investment programs for we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing as and when needed 
factors beyond our control  such as the recent credit crisis  may make it difficult or impossible for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
failure to obtain any required financing on a timely basis may cause us to postpone our development plans  forfeit rights in some or all of our projects or reduce or terminate some or all of our operations 
commodity price risk commodity price risk related to crude oil prices is one of our most significant market risk exposures 
crude oil prices and quality differentials are influenced by worldwide factors such as the recent credit crisis  opec actions  political events and supply and demand fundamentals 
to a lesser extent we are also exposed to natural gas price movements 
natural gas prices are generally influenced by oil prices  north american supply and demand and local market conditions 
using the company s actual worldwide crude oil production levels as an estimate for production  a bbl change in the realized price of oil  would increase or decrease net income and cash from operations for by million 
using the company s actual natural gas production levels as an estimate for production  a mcf change in the realized price of natural gas would increase or decrease net income and cash from operations for by less than million 

table of contents we periodically engage in the use of derivatives to minimize variability in our cash flow from operations and currently have costless collar contracts put in place as part of our bank loan facilities 
the company entered into costless collar derivatives to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its south midway property in california and spraberry property in west texas over a two year period starting november and a six month period starting november the derivatives had a ceiling price of  and  per barrel and a floor price of  and  per barrel  respectively  using wti as the index traded on the nymex 
the company also entered into a costless collar derivative to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its dagang field in china over a three year period starting september this derivative had a ceiling price of per barrel and a floor price of per barrel using wti as the index traded on the nymex 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company s open positions on the derivatives mentioned above had a fair value of million 
a increase in oil prices would reduce the fair value by approximately million  while a decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately million 
the fair value change assumes volatility based on prevailing market parameters at december  decreases in oil and natural gas prices would negatively impact our results of operations as a direct result of a reduction in revenues but may also do so in the ceiling test calculation for the impairment of our oil and gas properties 
on a quarterly basis  we compare the value of our proved and probable reserves  using estimated future oil and gas prices  to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
the ceiling test calculation is sensitive to oil and gas prices and in a period of declining prices could result in a charge to our results of operations as we experienced in when we recorded a million provision for impairment for canadian gaap and an additional million for us gaap mainly due to a decline in oil and gas prices 
decreases in oil and gas prices from those used in our ceiling test calculation as at december  as discussed above in critical accounting principles and estimates impairment of proved oil and gas properties may result in additional impairment provisions of our oil and gas properties 
the recoverable value of probable reserves is included only for the measurement of the impairment of the carrying value of oil and gas properties as required under canadian gaap but not for us gaap 
additionally  us gaap requires the use of period end oil and gas prices to measure the amount of the impairment rather than estimated future oil and gas prices as required by canadian gaap 
see critical accounting principles and estimates for the difference between canadian and us gaap in calculating the impairment provision for oil and gas properties 
foreign currency rate risk foreign currency risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment  recognized asset or liability will fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency rates 
the main underlying economic currency of the company s cash flows is the us dollar 
this is because the company s major product  crude oil  is priced internationally in us dollars 
accordingly  the company does not expect to face foreign exchange risks associated with its production revenues 
however  some of the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
the majority of the operating costs incurred in the chinese operations are paid in chinese renminbi 
the majority of costs incurred in the administrative offices in vancouver and calgary  as well as some business development costs  are paid in canadian dollars 
in addition  with the recent property acquisition in alberta see note the company s canadian dollar expenditures have increased during the last half of along with an increase in cash and debt balances denominated in canadian dollars 
disbursement transactions denominated in chinese renminbi and canadian dollars are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date 
foreign currency gains and losses also come about when monetary assets and liabilities  mainly short term payables and receivables  denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month 
the estimated impact of a strengthening or weakening of the chinese renminbi  and canadian dollar  as of december  on net loss and accumulated deficit for the year ended december  is a million increase  and a million decrease  respectively 
to help reduce the company s exposure to foreign currency risk it seeks to maximize the expenditures and contracts denominated in us dollars and minimize those denominated in other currencies  except for its canadian activities where it attempts to hold cash denominated in canadian dollars in order to manage its currency risk related to outstanding debt and current liabilities denominated in canadian dollars 
interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due to the changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from interest bearing borrowings which have a variable interest rate 
the company currently has two separate bank loan facilities  a promissory note and a convertible note with fluctuating interest rates 
the company estimates that its net loss and accumulated deficit for the year ended december  would have changed million for every change in interest rates as of december  the company is not currently actively attempting to mitigate this interest rate risk given the limited amount and term of its borrowings and the current global interest rate environment 

table of contents credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk with respect to its cash held with financial institutions  accounts receivable and advance balances 
the company believes its exposure to credit risk related to cash held with financial institutions is minimal due to the quality of the institutions where the cash is held and the nature of the deposit instruments 
most of the company s accounts receivable balances relate to oil and natural gas sales and are exposed to typical industry credit risks 
in addition  accounts receivable balances consist of costs billed to joint venture partners where the company is the operator and advances to partners for joint operations where the company is not the operator 
the advance balance relates to an arrangement whereby scheduled advances were made to a third party contractor associated with negotiating an htl tm and or gtl project for the company 
the company manages its credit risk by entering into sales contracts only with established entities and reviewing its exposure to individual entities on a regular basis 
of the million trade receivables balance as at december   million is due from a single customer and million is due from another single customer 
there are no other customers who represent more than of the total balance of trade receivables 
included in the company s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of million as of the year ended december  which are past due at the reporting date for which the company has not provided an allowance  as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable 
during the quarter ended september  the company recorded an allowance associated with the advance balance for the entire outstanding amount of million 
the provision was recorded in general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
there were no other changes to the allowance for credit losses account during the three month period ended december  and no other losses associated with credit risk were recorded during this same period 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the company s business activities may not be available  which means it may be forced to sell financial assets or non financial assets  refinance existing debt  raise new debt or issue equity 
the company s present plans to generate sufficient resources to assure continuation of its operations and achieve its capital investment objectives include alliances or other arrangements with entities with the resources to support the company s projects as well as project financing  debt financing or the sale of equity securities 
the availability of financing is dependent in part on the return of the credit and equity markets to normalized conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of the global economic crisis  the terms and availability of equity and debt capital have been materially restricted and financing may not be available when it required or on commercially acceptable terms 
trading we do not enter into contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had entered into such contracts
