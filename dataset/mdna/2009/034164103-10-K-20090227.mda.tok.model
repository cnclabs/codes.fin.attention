the agricultural commodity based business is one in which changes in selling prices generally move in relationship to changes in purchase prices 
therefore  increases or decreases in prices of the agricultural commodities that the company deals in will have a relatively equal impact on sales and cost of sales and a minimal impact on gross profit 
as a result  the significant increase in sales for the period is not 
table of contents necessarily indicative of the group s overall performance and more focus should be placed on changes to merchandising revenues and service income 
in  the company completed the purchase of a grain storage facility for million and finalized leasing agreements for two others 
these three facilities provide the company with million bushels of additional storage capacity  bringing the company s total capacity to approximately million bushels throughout the eastern corn belt 
grain inventories on hand at december  were million bushels  of which million bushels were stored for others 
this compares to million bushels on hand at december   of which million bushels were stored for others 
unprecedented market conditions earlier in the year caused grain prices to rise significantly 
when grain prices rise and customers have forward contracts with the company to sell grain at prices lower than the current market price  there is a greater risk for counterparty nonperformance 
the company closely monitors the nonperformance risk of its counterparties and will adjust the fair value of its open contracts if appropriate 
recent price declines have significantly mitigated the company s risk of nonperformance by its counterparties 
see note for further discussion regarding the fair value of our commodity contracts and associated counterparty risk 
the ethanol industry continues to be impacted by volatility in the commodity markets for both its production inputs and outputs as well as by government policy 
for the year ended december   the pricing relationship between corn and ethanol has had a significant negative impact on the results of the company s equity investments in its ethanol llcs 
the andersons marathon ethanol llc tame was the hardest hit as it was also impacted by significantly higher corn prices due to higher basis levels as weather affected corn production in the region 
with oil and gasoline prices falling  lowering the demand for ethanol as well as the price  and corn prices remaining high  the company expects ethanol margins to remain narrow  or even negative  throughout with the excess capacity in the industry  some ethanol companies around the country have shut down or idled their plants during the last half of the company believes this will help to bring industry capacity in line with current demand 
the company expects the pricing relationship between corn and ethanol to stabilize within the next couple of years and return to positive profit margins 
the company will continue to monitor the volatility in corn and ethanol prices and its impact on the ethanol llcs very closely  including any impact on the recoverability of the company s investments 
as of december   the company s investment balance in its three ethanol entities totaled approximately million

table of contents plant nutrient group the company s plant nutrient group purchases  stores  formulates  manufactures and sells dry and liquid fertilizer to dealers and farmers as well as sells reagents for air pollution control technologies used in coal fired power plants 
in addition  they provide warehousing and services to manufacturers and customers  formulate liquid anti icers and deicers for use on roads and runways  and distribute seeds and various farm supplies 
the major fertilizer ingredients sold by the company are nitrogen  phosphate and potash 
nutrient prices  which increased to historic highs earlier in the year  have dropped significantly in nitrogen and phosphate and are now close to the five year average 
a combination of a late harvest and uncertain economic conditions has resulted in a delay in fertilizer purchases by farmers 
motivated by cash needs or the desire to move inventory  nitrogen and phosphate producers with growing inventories have begun to lower prices 
this has resulted in farmers further delaying their purchasing in anticipation of more price declines 
these price declines in nitrogen and phosphate have resulted in year to date lower of cost or market and contract write downs of million 
the group will continue to monitor fertilizer price volatility into the spring planting season 
on may   the company acquired of the shares of douglass fertilizer chemical  inc this acquisition diversifies the group s product line offering and expands its geographic market outside of the traditional midwest row crops and into florida s rich specialty crops

corncob based products are sold throughout the year 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  a new manufacturing facility  built to manufacture a patented fertilizer product primarily for use on golf course greens  became fully operational 
with this increased capacity  the group has launched several new products for the season with favorable results 
with the recent decline in fertilizer prices  the group has been monitoring inventory values very closely 
because this group purchases nitrogen primarily as it is needed  the risk of inventory devaluation is significantly mitigated and currently no lower of cost or market issues exist 
retail group the retail group includes six stores operated as the andersons  which are located in the columbus  lima and toledo  ohio markets 
in the second quarter  the group opened a new specialty food store operated as the andersons market  located in the toledo  ohio market

the retail business is highly competitive 
the company competes with a variety of retail merchandisers  including home centers  department and hardware stores  as well as local and national grocers 
the retail industry has been significantly impacted by the weak economy and this will likely continue into the foreseeable future and will have a negative impact on future operating results 
the group has put forth an expense reduction effort to offset some of the negative effects of the weak economy

equity in earnings of affiliates decreased million  or  from the decrease from the company s ethanol llcs was million and the decrease from lansing trade group llc ltg was million due to counterparty losses recorded during the fourth quarter 
with the ethanol llcs  the decrease in earnings is a result of the pricing relationship between corn and ethanol which has made it extremely difficult to produce ethanol at a profit 
as part of its risk management policy with these entities  the company attempts to lock in a reasonable margin using forward contracting  however  as the price of corn began to rise and the price of ethanol began to drop  there were limited opportunities to lock in reasonable margins 
each of the ethanol facilities are installing control equipment which is expected to increase throughput capacity  energy efficiencies and decrease emissions 
it is expected that this new technology will produce significant cost savings for these entities 
the projects are expected to be competed within the next year 
the decrease in earnings from ltg were primarily the result of counterparty credit issues that surfaced during the fourth quarter in ltg s corn originations business that resulted in significant reserves being recorded

the final purchase price was million 
both of these acquisitions are within the plant nutrient group 
in september  the company completed the purchase of a grain storage facility for million and finalized leasing arrangements for two others 
these three facilities provide the company with million bushels of additional storage capacity  bringing the company s total capacity to million bushels throughout the eastern corn belt 
the company expects to spend approximately million in on conventional property  plant and equipment and an additional million for the purchase and capitalized modifications of railcars with related sales or financings of million 
financing arrangements the company has significant committed short term lines of credit available to finance working capital  primarily inventories  margin calls on commodity contracts and accounts receivable 
the company is party to a borrowing arrangement with a syndicate of banks  which was amended in april  to provide the company with million in short term lines of credit 
the arrangement also includes a temporary flex line  which was amended in october  allowing the company an additional million of borrowing capacity 
the temporary flex line matures in april and the line of credit matures in september the company had not drawn on its short term line of credit at december  this is a million decrease from the short term borrowings as of december  and is due primarily to the significant decrease in margin call requirements 
peak borrowing on the line of credit during was million in march when commodity prices were at all time highs 
typically  the company s highest borrowing occurs in the spring due to seasonal inventory requirements in the fertilizer and retail businesses  credit sales of fertilizer and a customary reduction in grain payables due 
table of contents to the cash needs and market strategies of grain customers 
in addition to amending its short term lines during  the company entered into a million long term note purchase agreement during the first quarter and a million bond note during the third quarter 
certain of the company s long term borrowings include covenants that  among other things  impose minimum levels of working capital and equity  and limitations on additional debt 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  in addition  certain of the company s long term borrowings are collateralized by first mortgages on various facilities or are collateralized by railcar assets 
the company s non recourse long term debt is collateralized by railcar and locomotive assets 
a cash dividend of per common share was paid in the first three quarters of a cash dividend of was paid in the fourth quarter of and the first and second quarters of a cash dividend of was paid in the third and fourth quarter of and the first quarter of during  the company issued approximately  shares to employees and directors under its share compensation plans 
in addition  the company repurchased approximately  shares during the fourth quarter of for million 
because the company is a significant consumer of short term debt in peak seasons and the majority of this is variable rate debt  increases in interest rates could have a significant impact on the profitability of the company 
in addition  periods of high grain prices and or unfavorable market conditions could require the company to make additional margin deposits on its exchange traded futures contracts 
conversely  in periods of declining prices  the company receives a return of cash 
the recent volatility in the capital and credit markets has had a significant impact on the economy 
while this volatile and challenging economic environment is a reality  the company has continued to have good access to the credit markets 
for example  at its high  the company had over million of committed borrowing capacity on its short term line of credit 
this is significantly higher than our peak borrowing of million 
the company s short term credit facility has a three year commitment and expires in september the company is already in the process of renewing this line and expects to close at the beginning of the second quarter 
there are currently banks in the bank group and the company has been informed that not all of the banks will participate in the renewal 
while certain banks have indicated that they will not participate  others have shown interest in joining the bank group 
with this  the company expects a less than reduction in the total commitment 
based on preliminary discussions with the bank  the company does not expect any changes to covenants 
over the past months  the company has been able to successfully work with its lenders to expand and contract its borrowing capacity under the short term line as needed to ensure that it has an adequate liquidity cushion 
this is due  in part  to the fact that the company reduced its reliance on short term credit facilities by raising million in long term debt during in the unlikely event that the company were faced with a situation where it was not able to access the capital markets including through the renewal of its line of credit  the company believes it could successfully implement contingency plans to maintain adequate liquidity such as expanding or contracting the amount of its forward grain contracting  which will reduce the impact of grain price volatility on its daily margin calls 
additionally  the company could begin to liquidate its stored grain inventory as well as execute sales contracts with its customers that align the timing of the receipt of grain from its producers to the shipment of grain to its customers thereby freeing up working capital that is typically utilized to store the grain for extended periods of time 
the company believes that its operating cash flow  the marketability of its grain inventories  other liquidity contingency plans and its access to sufficient sources of liquidity  will enable it to meet its ongoing funding requirements 
at december   the company had million available under its short term line of credit

railcars owned by the company  or leased by the company from a financial intermediary  are generally leased to a customer under an operating lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to a financial intermediary  and assigns the related operating lease to the financial intermediary on a non recourse basis 
in such arrangements  the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediary  and receives a fee for such services 
on most of the railcars and locomotives  the company holds an option to purchase these assets at the end of the lease

the company has future lease payment commitments aggregating million for the railcars leased by the company from financial intermediaries under various operating leases 
remaining lease terms vary with none exceeding twelve years 
the majority of these railcars have been leased to customers at december  over similar terms 
the company prefers non recourse lease transactions  whenever possible  in order to minimize its credit risk 
refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s leasing activities 
in addition to the railcar counts above  the grain ethanol group owns railcars which it leases to third parties under operating leases 
these cars are included in railcar assets leased to others in the consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting estimates are considered critical  as they are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and or require significant or complex judgment by management 
there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  however  they are not deemed critical as defined above 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item describes our significant accounting policies which should be read in conjunction with our critical accounting estimates 
grain inventories and commodity derivative contracts the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain and ethanol  over the counter ethanol contracts  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the overall market for grain inventories is very liquid and active  market value is determined by reference to prices for identical commodities on the chicago board of trade adjusted for primarily transportation costs  and the company s grain inventories may be sold without significant additional processing 
commodity derivative contracts represent forward purchase and sale contracts and both exchange traded and over the counter contracts 
management estimates fair value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets  as well as counter party non performance risk in the case of forward and over the counter contracts 
unprecedented market conditions in the grain industry have led to increases in the risk of non performance by the counterparties 
the amount of risk  and therefore the impact to the fair value of the contracts  varies by type of contract and type of counter party 
with the exception of specific customers thought to be at higher risk  the company looks at the contracts in total  segregated by contract type  in its assessment of nonperformance risk 
for those customers that are thought to be at higher risk  the company makes assumptions as to performance based on past history and facts about the current situation 
changes in fair value are recorded as a component of sales and 
table of contents merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
the recent decrease in commodity prices from their historic highs during the first half of  along with the completion of the fall harvest  have significantly mitigated the company s counterparty nonperformance risk 
the total value of negative contract equity ie the aggregate amounts for which the current market prices of the quantities of the underlying commodities exceed the amounts for which the company s producers have contracted to sell to the company for at december  was million  compared to million at december  if management used different methods or factors to estimate fair value or if there were changes in economic circumstances or deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to the contracts  the amounts reported as inventories  commodity derivative assets and liabilities and sales and merchandising revenues could differ 
at december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  of fair value allowances relating to non performance risk 
impairment of long lived assets and equity method investments the company s various business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or rolling stock 
in addition  the company has a limited amount of intangible assets and goodwill described more fully in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item that it acquired in various business combinations 
whenever changing conditions warrant  the company assesses whether the realizability of its impacted tangible and intangible assets may be impaired 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
these reviews for impairment take into account estimates of future undiscounted  and as appropriate discounted  cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease terms  operating costs  life of the assets  potential disposition proceeds  budgets and long range plans 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these cash flows  the company could recognize different amounts of expense in future periods 
the company also holds investments in seven limited liability companies that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the company reviews its investments to determine whether there has been a decline in the estimated fair value of the investment that is below the company s carrying value which is other than temporary 
at december   the company s total investment in ethanol entities accounted for using the equity method of accounting was million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the continued losses incurred from its investment in tame warranted additional assessment 
in accordance with apb the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  the company assessed whether it was likely that tame would  based on the company s reasonable assumptions  sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the company s investment in tame of million 
as part of this assessment  the company used external market data as well as its own internal industry expertise to create assumptions about future corn  ddg and ethanol prices  tame s future production rate and changes to the renewable fuels standard 
using these assumptions  the company prepared a forecast of discounted cash flows from operations through  using tame s average borrowing rates as the discount rate 
the company then compared its proportional share of those cash flows to its investment balance at december  the analysis performed indicated that the company would have the ability to recover all of its investment  supporting the fact that tame is likely to sustain earnings to justify the carrying value of the company s investment  and therefore  no impairment exists 
for ethanol producers like tame whereby corn is the primary raw material for the production of ethanol  the profitability of such entity will largely be attributable to the relationship between the price of corn and the price of ethanol  and accordingly  the company s estimates of future corn and ethanol prices is the most significant estimate utilized in its assessment of the tame cash flows 
correspondingly  the recoverability of the company s investment in tame under apb will be significantly impacted by the accuracy of those assumptions 
many factors  including recent volatility in the corn markets as well as oversupply in the ethanol industry  have reduced current margins to levels which are presently putting significant pressure on ethanol entities to achieve profitability 
for a number or reasons  including the likelihood of more stabilized corn prices and anticipated reductions to the oversupply situation in the ethanol markets due to the increasing requirements under the renewable fuel standards  the company is anticipating margins to become much more favorable to ethanol producers 
the company has formed this judgment on margins based on its own internal forecasting as well as through the use of outside advisors that specialize in forecasting corn and ethanol prices and believe such assumptions to be reasonable  although clearly not certain 
as the commodities used in the production of ethanol are subject to significant price volatility  the company has the risk that the assumptions used will not be reflective of actual price trends 
as the company has the ability and intent to hold this and its other ethanol investments for the long term  the company will continue to monitor these assumptions going forward 
lower of cost or market inventory adjustments the company records its non grain inventory at the lower of cost or market 
whenever changing conditions warrant  the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventory compared to the current market 
market price is determined using both external data  such as current selling prices by third parties and quoted trading prices for the same or similar products  and internal data  such as the company s current ask price and expectations on normal margins 
if the evaluation indicates that the company s 
table of contents inventory is being carried at values higher than the current market can support  the company will write down its inventory to its best estimate of net realizable value 
significant price volatility in the fertilizer markets  primarily in nitrogen and phosphate  and a late harvest led to delayed purchasing on the part of the farmer producer and as a result fertilizer prices began to drop significantly 
this resulted in the company carrying high amounts of inventory at values above what it estimated it could recover 
the company prepared a lower of cost or market analysis to determine what the carrying value of the fertilizer inventory should be 
due to the low transaction volume in the market  the company was required to make assumptions about future selling prices 
the company used various inputs including actual sales made and offers from customers and suppliers as well as equivalent offers based on known basis levels to that point 
this assessment resulted in lower of cost or market inventory and contract adjustment of million 
an assumed additional decrease in net realizable value would have resulted in an additional write down of approximately million 
employee benefit plans the company provides all full time  non retail employees with pension benefits and full time employees hired before january  with postretirement health care benefits 
in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future healthcare cost trends 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
in  the company amended its defined benefit pension plans effective january  the provisions of this amendment include freezing benefits for the retail line of business employees as of december   modifying the calculation of benefits for the non retail line of business employees as of december  with future benefits to be calculated using a new career average formula and in the case of all employees  compensation for the years through will be includable in the final average pay formula calculating the final benefit earned for years prior to december  taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity prices the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in global demand created by population growth and higher standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in purchase and sale commitments for grain and grain held in inventory  the company enters into exchange traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges 
the market value of exchange traded futures and options used for economic hedging has a high  but not perfect correlation  to the underlying market value of grain inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the less correlated portion of 
table of contents inventory and purchase and sale contract market value known as basis is much less volatile than the overall market value of exchange traded futures and tends to follow historical patterns 
the company manages this less volatile risk using its daily grain position report to constantly monitor its position relative to the price changes in the market 
in addition  inventory values are affected by the month to month spread relationships in the regulated futures markets  as the company carries inventories over time 
these spread relationships are also less volatile than the overall market value and tend to follow historical patterns but also represent a risk that cannot be directly offset 
the company s accounting policy for its futures and options  as well as the underlying inventory positions and purchase and sale contracts  is to mark them to the market price daily and include gains and losses in the statement of income in sales and merchandising revenues 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its commodity position exclusive of basis risk 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows december  in thousands net long short position market risk interest rates the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates and credit ratings for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
in addition  the company has derivative interest rate contracts recorded in its balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of these contracts is estimated based on quoted market termination values 
market risk  which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent decrease in interest rates  is summarized below december  in thousands fair value of long term debt and interest rate contracts fair value in excess of less than carrying value market risk
