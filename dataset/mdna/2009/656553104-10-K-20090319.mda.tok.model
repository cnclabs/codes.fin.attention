gross profits as a percentage of net sales were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net income in was  or per diluted common share compared to  or per diluted common share in the global economy is currently experiencing a broad recession 
although we have not been significantly impacted through december   we are now experiencing increased customer order cancellations and delays 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  known trends in the industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical estimates that require significant judgment are as follows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of manufactured products to customers  when title has passed  all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we also provide engineering services separate from the manufacture of a product 
revenue for engineering services is recognized upon completion of the engineering process  providing standalone fair value to our customers 
our engineering services are short term in nature 
in addition  we have another separate source of revenue that comes from short term repair services  which are recognized upon completion of the repairs  and the repaired products are shipped back to the customer 
shipping and handling costs charged to our customers are included in net sales  while the corresponding shipping expenses are included in cost of goods sold 
allowance for uncollectible accounts when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze accounts receivable  historical write offs of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of 
table of contents collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we have historically not experienced significant bad debts expense and believe the reserve is adequate for any exposure to loss in the december  accounts receivable 
inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or quantities in excess of future production needs 
we have an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate our inventory based on current usage and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we believe the total reserve at december  is adequate 
long lived and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge might be required to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
to date  we have determined that no impairment of long lived assets exists 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment which requires us to measure and recognize in our consolidated financial statements the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recognized for each option award 
there are several assumptions that must be made when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each award  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the award  the expected dividends to be paid and the risk free interest rate expected during the award term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the award and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
an increase in the volatility of our stock price or an increase in the average period before exercise will increase the amount of compensation expense related to awards granted after december  based on a critical assessment of our accounting estimates and the underlying judgments and uncertainties of those estimates  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
no matters have come to our attention since december  that would cause the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements to change materially

gross profit for the years ended december  and  we had gross profit of million and million  respectively

selling selling expenses were million or of net sales for the year ended december  and million or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in selling expense of million from can be attributed to increased commission expenses of million as a result of higher commissionable sales  as well as a million increase in marketing and sales related spending  consisting primarily of personnel  travel and expense to support the sales efforts

financial condition and liquidity we believe that our existing financing arrangements and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investments  and debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants in our financing arrangements

we currently do not have alternative financing arrangements  and if we were required to obtain 
table of contents financing in a short period of time to avoid default  financing might not be available  or the terms of that financing might be disadvantageous 
credit lines on august   we entered into an th amendment to our credit agreement with wfb which expires  if not renewed  on june   and under which both the line of credit and real estate term note are subject to variations in the libor rate

the line is secured by substantially all of our assets

the cash flow from operations is primarily due to net income of million and noncash depreciation  amortization  and other noncash expenses  and the change in deferred taxes  which totaled million in net positive adjustments 
cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was million 
this was driven by a million reduction in accounts receivable  offset by an increase in inventory of million and other changes in current operating items of million
