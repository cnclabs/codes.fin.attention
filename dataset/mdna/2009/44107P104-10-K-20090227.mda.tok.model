item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview as of february   we own luxury and upper upscale hotel properties and we are the largest lodging reit in the national association of real estate investment trust s composite index 
a reit is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and  through payments of dividends to stockholders  is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level 
host operates as a self managed and self administered reit and owns approximately of the partnership interests of host hotels resorts  lp  or host lp 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry 
the majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors 
in  approximately of our revenues were generated by our urban and resort conference hotels 
the classification of a property as luxury or upper upscale is based on lodging industry standards  which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities  level of service and quality of accommodations 
while our hotels are still subject to competitive pressures  we believe this strategy will allow us to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors 
we seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in optimizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements 
our customers the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business  and contract business  which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our room sales 
similar to the majority of the lodging industry  we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers 
business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels  with leisure travelers making up the remainder 
therefore  we will be more significantly affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand 
the four key subcategories of the transient business group are premium sometimes referred to as rack rate  typically consists of rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available 
room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality  weekday vs 
weekend stays 
corporate this is the benchmark rate which a hotel publishes and offers to the general public 
it is typically the second highest category  and is for travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates 
special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally 
these rates are typically negotiated annually  at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate 
discount this encompasses all discount programs  such as aaa and aarp discounts  government per diem  rooms booked through wholesale channels  frequent guest program redemptions  and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel 
group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together  usually with a minimum of rooms 
examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion 
the three key sub categories of the group business category are association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions 
corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg  product launches  training programs  contract negotiations  and presentations 
other group business predominately related to social  military  education  religious  fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams  otherwise known as smerf business 
the final category is contract demand  which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates 
contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand 
airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels 
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements under which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages  utilities  property taxes and other hotel level expenses 
we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period  depending on the manager  which reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation 
hotel revenue is approximately of our total revenue 
the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue of revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie  group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business  which may or may not utilize the hotel s restaurants 
other revenue 
occupancy  the nature of the property ie  resort  etc 
and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf course  spa  telephone  entertainment and other guest services 
hotel operating expenses are approximately of our total operating costs and expenses 
the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses of operating costs and expenses rooms expense 
these costs include housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense 
these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages  as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided 
food and beverage expense 
these expenses primarily include food  beverage and labor costs 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie  catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental and support expenses 
these expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other ancillary revenues such as parking  golf courses  spas  telephones  entertainment and other guest services  as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments  sales and marketing  repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs 
management fees 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue 
incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels 
other property level expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent and property insurance 
many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this is a non cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures 
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations 
it is also worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items  however  taken separately these costs represent approximately of our hotel operating expenses 
key performance indicators revenue per available room  or revpar  is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include food and beverage or parking  telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
revpar changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels  as well as incremental operating profit than do changes that are driven predominately by average room rate 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in additional room related costs 
as a result  changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels 
in discussing our operating results  we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis 
comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared 
comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage  large scale capital improvements or significant events during these periods 
we also evaluate the performance of our business through non gaap financial measures  including funds from operations ffo per diluted share and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit 
we use ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
another key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit  which is a non gaap measure used to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property level profitability 
the comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels 
each of the non gaap measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit and earnings per share 
we provide a more detailed discussion of these non gaap financial measures  how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance as well as certain limitations of such measures 
see non gaap financial measures in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
summary of operating results during  we were significantly affected by the economic recession in the us and the collapse of the credit markets  which contributed to a significant decrease in business and consumer spending 
these factors combined to depress overall lodging demand for both the company and the lodging industry throughout  which resulted in a year long decline in occupancy levels and  starting in the fourth quarter  a decline in average room rates 
the company began to experience a decline in comparable revpar in the third quarter before decreasing sharply in the fourth quarter 
overall comparable revpar decreased in as a result of a decrease in occupancy of percentage points  which was partially offset by a 
in increase in average room rate 
additionally  food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels decreased during total revenue decreased million  or  to billion for the year  primarily due to the decline in revpar and food and beverage revenues 
as a result  we have experienced a steady weakening in operating results and a decrease in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit each quarter  though most significantly in the fourth quarter 
net income from continuing operations decreased million in to million 
net income decreased million to million in the decrease was primarily due to a decline in operations at our hotels and a decrease in gains on dispositions from million in compared to million in diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased 
to 
in  while diluted earnings per share decreased 
to 
in ffo per diluted share decreased  to  for ffo per diluted share was reduced by 
for due to costs associated with debt repayments or refinancings 
there were no such costs incurred in we worked to mitigate the decline in revenues and operating income by directing our operators to implement significant contingency plans early in the year to help contain margin deterioration 
these cost cutting measures included right sizing the work force to the amount of business being generated  not filling vacant positions  reducing discretionary spending  delaying the implementation of brand standards  closing restaurant outlets or modifying hours of operations  as well as closing specific floors or towers to reflect the decrease in occupancy 
while these efforts have been successful in reducing operating costs  other expenses such as wages and benefits  real estate taxes and utilities increased at above inflationary rates in in addition to our cost cutting measures  our managers accessed additional revenue channels  particularly e commerce channels  in an effort to offset the decline in revenues from more traditional sources 
investing activities acquisitions dispositions domestically  we did not complete any acquisitions during during the first half of  as lodging fundamentals weakened  the luxury and upper upscale hotels that were marketed did not meet our investment criteria 
during the second half of  the economic recession deepened and the ability to obtain financing for acquisitions became extremely limited and only at much lower leverage ratios and at significantly higher interest rates 
consequently  very few hotels were marketed or sold 
management believes that there may be an increase in the number of assets available for purchase late in and in as a result of the current recessionary environment and illiquid credit market 
our european joint venture in which we hold a interest  was able to successfully complete the purchase of the room crowne plaza amsterdam city centre for approximately million us million in april on february   we disposed of the hyatt regency boston for net proceeds of approximately million  including the return of reserves held by the manager 
we anticipate that we will recognize a gain on the disposition of approximately million  net of tax  in during  we disposed of the sheraton tampa suites airport hotel and the host airport hotel sacramento 
proceeds from these dispositions were approximately million and we recorded a gain of million  net of tax  in capital expenditures we recently completed a three year billion capital expenditure program  which we believe significantly enhances the competitiveness of our properties 
this program consisted of renewal and replacement  roi repositioning and value enhancement projects in a broad array of areas including lobbies and public spaces  food and beverage facilities  spas  retail outlets  meeting space and rooms as well as energy conservation and other non public areas of the properties 
we spent approximately million on capital expenditures in  including million on roi repositioning projects and value enhancement projects at properties 
these amounts include the application of a million deposit made in these projects included the completion of a  square foot exhibit hall at the orlando world center marriott in  the construction of new food and beverage facilities  renovation of all existing break out space and the construction of the new  square foot atrium ballroom at the atlanta marriott marquis in and  and the construction of an  square foot meeting space addition and the renovation of over  square feet of public space and food and beverage facilities at the san francisco marriott in additionally  our renewal and replacement capital expenditures totaled million during and included the renovation of over  rooms and over  square feet of meeting space 
as a result of these efforts and in an effort to improve future liquidity  we anticipate reducing total capital expenditures to approximately million to million in  which represents approximately one half of the level 
a significant portion of our spending in will be dedicated to projects that are already in process 
additionally  we may reduce the level of expenditures further if the economic recession is longer or deeper than currently anticipated 
financing activities the volatility and disruption in the credit markets in the latter half of was dramatic and has resulted in significantly higher interest rates for all types of financing  as well as greatly reduced availability for many of the traditional forms of financing such as collateralized mortgage backed securities and other secured debt financings 
as noted above  this not only affected the ability to acquire or dispose of assets  but also to refinance existing debt 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  yields on bb rated senior notes peaked at approximately  or approximately basis points over treasury rates 
this is compared to yields of approximately and spreads of approximately basis points in the fourth quarter of while spreads tightened by to basis points since mid december  they are still well above the historical average 
due to this uncertainty in the financial markets  we increased our available cash position by drawing million on the revolving portion of the credit facility in september as a result of prior year efforts to establish a capital structure with the appropriate mixture of debt and equity and balanced maturities  we ended with strong interest coverage and leverage ratios under our credit facility and senior notes covenants see financial condition 
currently  our debt maturities in are approximately million  including million of principal amortization  which we have the ability to either refinance or repay 
subsequent to the closing of the sale of the hyatt regency boston on february   we have over million of cash and cash equivalents and million of capacity under our credit facility revolver 
outlook we believe the recessionary economic environment expected for  specifically declining gdp  employment  business investment  corporate profits and consumer spending  will negatively impact the demand for lodging in both the business and leisure components of our business 
when looking at historical relationships  the current consensus estimates for the key economic drivers would suggest an overall decrease in industry lodging demand ranging from to 
we believe that lodging demand will decline in and  in particular  we expect lodging demand in the luxury segment will continue to underperform other segments as consumers trade down to less expensive alternatives 
we do not anticipate an improvement in lodging demand until the current economic trends reverse course  particularly the expected continued weakness in the overall economy and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
while new supply in is expected to be moderately above historical average  we expect that as a result of the current fiscal environment increases in lodging supply over the next few years will likely slow significantly 
this may be particularly relevant for the markets and lodging sectors in which we compete due to the long term planning and high level of investment associated with these properties 
we believe that the economic slowdown will significantly affect both the group and transient elements of our business 
we believe group demand will continue to decline as companies reduce travel expenditures  which will lead to increased cancellations  diminished booking activity and reduced attendance 
similarly  the reduction in corporate travel budgets will affect the transient business traveler 
the consumer led elements of this economic slowdown will also result in a disproportionate impact to leisure dependent destinations  such as hawaii and florida  as domestic and international households are likely to reduce discretionary spending 
in  we declared a total dividend of 
per share 
we intend to suspend our regular quarterly dividend in and instead we expect to declare a 
to 
per share common dividend in the fourth quarter  which may be paid either in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
the amount of any dividend will be determined by host s board of directors 
we intend to continue paying dividends on our preferred stock 
the general economic trends discussed above make it a difficult environment to predict operating results for our hotels for therefore  there can be no assurances that we will not experience further declines in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  greater than anticipated weakness in the economy and changes in travel patterns

see discontinued operations below 
comparable hotel revpar decreased 
the decrease in revpar was the result of a percentage point decrease in occupancy which was slightly offset by a 
increase in average room rates 
occupancy was negatively affected by the decrease in overall lodging demand 
food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels decreased  primarily due to decreased sales from our catering and banquet business and meeting room rentals and the decline in occupancy at our hotels 
other revenues for our comparable hotels  which primarily represent spa  golf  parking  internet connectivity and other fees  were down slightly 
while management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market  overall we evaluate the portfolio operating results using three different criteria property type ie urban  suburban  resort conference or airport  geographic region and mix of business ie transient  group or contract

for  revpar decreased across all of our hotel property types 
revpar at our resort conference properties have been particularly affected by the current economic recession due to reduced consumer spending and increased travel costs 
in particular  our hawaiian properties have seen a dramatic decline in revpar as a result of decreased airlift to the hawaiian islands and overall weak demand in this market 
revpar at our urban  airport and suburban hotels also declined due to the overall decline in lodging demand

for further discussion  see reporting periods 
in terms of revpar growth  our international region was the top performing region due to revpar growth at our chilean and canadian hotels and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
comparable hotel revpar growth in our florida region was driven by revpar growth at the harbor beach marriott where we benefited from prior year disruption caused by rooms renovations and the orlando world center marriott where significant discounting drove transient demand 
revpar results were partially offset by rooms renovations at three hotels in the region  as well as the impact of hurricane fay 
revpar growth in the south central region was the result of year over year growth in our houston market which had a strong fourth quarter due to hurricane ike induced demand as well as our san antonio properties  which experienced strong group business because of recent renovations in the fourth quarter of the revpar decline in our pacific region was driven by the revpar decline at our hawaiian properties and a decline at our san diego properties 
the region s best performer based on revpar growth was the san francisco market which had a increase in revpar  however  the revpar growth was concentrated in the first half of the year  as revpar in san francisco declined significantly in the fourth quarter 
revpar in our new england region also declined  reflecting decreased demand at our boston hotels due to fewer city wide events and softening leisure demand 
in addition  we experienced higher group attrition and cancellations than in prior periods 
the north central region underperformed other regions  as results in chicago were particularly weak due primarily to renovations at three of our chicago properties and lower transient demand 
the atlanta region also underperformed in comparison to the overall portfolio due to weak group bookings  lower transient demand and increased supply 
revpar in our mountain region also declined as the phoenix market continued to struggle due to lower group and transient demand and rooms renovations at two hotels 
hotel sales by business mix 
the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient  group and contract business 
the information below is derived from business mix data for of our hotels for which business mix data is available from our managers 
in  overall transient average daily rates decreased when compared to last year while our overall group average room rate increased almost over the prior year as most of the business was contracted prior to any significant downturn 
we expect that booking pace will continue to slow as the weaker economy slows demand growth and  as a result  we expect increased competition in terms of pricing will put added pressure on rates 
compared to hotel sales growth for was due to increases in revpar  as well as increases in food and beverage and other revenue items 
hotel sales for also reflect a full year of operations for the starwood portfolio and include  million and million in and  respectively  from these properties 
sales for properties sold in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations below 
comparable hotel revpar increased as of december   of our hotels were classified as comparable hotels 
the increase in revpar was the result of strong growth in average room rates and a slight increase in occupancy 
the growth in average room rate was driven by increasing demand due to strong economic growth in the first half of and low growth in the supply of new luxury and upper upscale hotels 
as a result of these trends  our operators were able to continue to increase room rates  while marginally improving the year over year occupancy levels 
however  occupancy was affected at a number of our hotels by our capital expenditure program  which is described below  as well as weakness in individual markets 
food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels increased  primarily due to increased sales from our catering and banquet business and meeting room rentals 
in addition  operating margins at our food and beverage outlets increased percentage points 
other revenues for our comparable hotels  which primarily represent spa  golf  parking  internet connectivity and other fees  increased

we also experienced revpar growth at our suburban hotels due to strong performances at our suburban boston  denver and los angeles hotels 
revpar growth at our airport hotels was led by our san francisco and houston airport hotels 
revpar growth for our resort convention hotels was moderate as several hotels were significantly affected by major renovations

the new england region also performed well due to increased city wide events in the boston market  particularly during the second half of the year  as this market was affected by lower levels of group and transient demand during the first half of the year 
increases in revpar for our pacific  dc metro and mountain regions were generally consistent with the levels for the overall portfolio 
increases in revpar in our pacific region were driven by the los angeles and san francisco markets 
the los angeles market grew due to increased average room rates for transient business along with a strong group base 
the san francisco market had a strong year driven by city wide events 
the growth in the dc metro region was driven by the performance of our downtown hotels  which was partially offset by weak performance by our suburban properties in the region 
revpar growth during the year in the florida region was moderate  as group activity was slow due to hurricane concerns and renovation displacement at several hotels including the harbor beach marriott resort and spa and the tampa marriott waterside hotel and marina 
the weak revpar growth in the atlanta region was due to lower levels of occupancy  as city wide demand decreased from the unusually strong performance in that reflected business relocation from new orleans due to hurricane katrina 
however  in the fourth quarter  the atlanta region experienced revpar increases due to strong group bookings in the mid town area 
the north central region under performed the portfolio primarily due to weakness in the chicago market 
hotel sales by business mix 
in  relatively strong demand levels allowed our operators to increase average daily room rates  particularly in the corporate transient segments 
overall transient average daily rates increased when compared to last year and our overall group average room rate for these hotels increased almost 
compared to and compared to property level operating expenses change to change to in millions in millions rooms food and beverage other departmental and support expenses management fees other property level expenses depreciation and amortization total property level operating expenses property level operating expenses increased each year from through due to several factors 
in  the increase was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to our extensive billion capital expenditure program from to this was offset by a decline in revenue driven costs  primarily management fees  reflecting our decline in operations during the second half of the year 
by contrast  in  all property level costs increased  reflecting inflation  increases in revenue driven costs and the effect of our capital expenditures on our depreciation expense 
our operating costs and expenses  which are both fixed and variable  are affected by changes in occupancy  inflationary increases and revenues  though the effect on specific costs will differ 
for example  utility costs include a fixed component but will increase based on occupancy and with inflation  while depreciation expense is fixed except for the effects of property transactions ie acquisitions  capital expenditures  dispositions  etc similarly  management fees are directly affected by total revenues  as well as the level of operating profit at each property 
additionally  and property level operating expenses include the property level expenses of the starwood portfolio for a full year of approximately million and million  respectively 
comparatively  property level operating expenses for include starwood portfolio expenses for the period from april  the purchase date through december  of million 
property level operating expenses exclude the costs associated with hotels we have sold  which are included in discontinued operations 
other income statement line items corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and benefits including stock based compensation expense  as well as other costs such as travel  corporate insurance  audit fees  building rent and system costs 
corporate expenses decreased approximately million in from and approximately million in from due to the decrease in compensation expense recorded for our liability classified stock based compensation awards as the market performance criteria for the issuance of our restricted stock were not met and fewer shares were earned 
additionally  included non recurring costs of approximately million associated with the starwood acquisition 
gain on insurance settlement 
we recorded a gain on insurance settlement of million in  million in and million in the gains primarily relate to the insurance proceeds received for both business interruption and property damage following hurricanes katrina and wilma which occurred during september and october the hurricanes caused substantial business interruption and property damage at our new orleans marriott and at five of our hotels located in southern florida 
during  the gain of million primarily represents the release of contingencies related to an insurance settlement reached for business interruption incurred at the new orleans marriott 
during  we recognized a gain of million related to business interruption insurance proceeds received as a result of lost profit primarily at our new orleans marriott 
additionally  all of the insurance gains of million in represent business interruption insurance proceeds 
the remaining gain of million in related to insurance proceeds for property damage sustained by these properties 
the gain represents the insurance proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable recorded on the balance sheet at the date of loss 
the insurance receivable reflected the book value of the property and equipment written off and repairs and maintenance costs incurred from the hurricanes 
we recognize the gains on insurance settlements once all contingencies are met  and  as a result  none of the property insurance proceeds were recognized in income during or interest income 
the million decline in interest income for when compared to is primarily due to lower interest rates during  as well as a slightly lower weighted average cash balance for the full year compared to the increase of million from to was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cash balance in interest expense 
the decrease of million in interest expense for is primarily due to an expense of million related to call premiums and the acceleration of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with debt prepayments during compared to an million gain in related to the repurchase of million principal amount of our debentures 
the decline in interest expense also reflects the decrease in our weighted average interest rate of percentage points to 
the decrease of million in interest expense in is primarily due to a net decrease in debt of approximately million and a decrease in our weighted average interest rate of percentage points to 
the decrease is partially offset by call premiums and the acceleration of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with debt prepayments totaling million for compared to similar costs of million for minority interest expense 
minority interest expense decreased million in and million in due to a decline in the net income of host lp during both years 
host lp net income reflects the operations at our hotels and is significantly affected by the gain on dispositions  which were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
in  our share of income of affiliates decreased by million compared to primarily due to a decrease in earnings from our joint venture in europe and the write off of costs associated with a terminated transaction 
however  in  our share of income of affiliates increased by million compared to primarily due to an increase in earnings from our european joint venture  which was formed in april of discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of two hotels disposed of in  nine hotels disposed of during and seven hotels disposed of in and represent the results of operations and the gains on the disposition of these hotels during the periods 
the following table summarizes the revenues  income before taxes  and the gain on dispositions  net of tax  of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented in millions revenues income before taxes gain on disposals  net of tax liquidity and capital resources overview we seek to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash  debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry 
during this period of economic uncertainty  we have taken several steps to preserve capital and increase liquidity  including the third quarter draw of million on our credit facility  the reduction of our dividend beginning in the fourth quarter and the implementation of cost savings initiatives at both the corporate and hotel level which will include a reduction in in capital expenditures to approximately one half of the level 
we believe  as a result of all of the above mentioned efforts and the overall strength of our balance sheet  we have sufficient liquidity and access to capital markets to withstand the anticipated decline in operating cash flow in and pay our debt maturities  fund our capital expenditure programs and maintain compliance with our debt financial covenants 
we continue to maintain higher than historical cash levels due to uncertainty in the credit markets and we intend to do so until the credit markets stabilize 
cash requirements 
we use cash for acquisitions  capital expenditures  debt payments  operating costs  corporate and other expenses and dividends to stockholders 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income excluding net capital gain to our stockholders 
our sources of cash are cash from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets  borrowings under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various capital markets 
set forth below is a schedule of our debt maturities through our near term debt maturities in and are relatively low 
while maturities in total million  they include borrowings under the revolver portion of the credit facility  as well as the million credit facility term loan and the orlando marriott world center mortgage  all of which are subject to extension at our option if certain requirements are met

we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 
as a result  the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure 
therefore  our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt  pay dividends and make investments is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants  which include  among others  the allowable amounts of leverage  coverage and fixed charges 
since  we have improved our financial covenant ratios through a number of transactions that have extended our weighted average maturity and reduced interest costs 
as a result of these efforts  our weighted average interest rate has declined significantly  from at december  to at december  and our weighted average maturities have remained consistent at approximately five years 
additionally  since december   we have reduced our secured mortgage indebtedness by approximately to billion  which represents approximately of our overall indebtedness and is secured by of our hotels 
as of december   approximately of our hotels as measured by revenues are unencumbered by mortgage debt 
given the flexibility provided by the structure of our balance sheet  we will look to access both the market for our senior notes and the secured mortgage debt markets  based on relative pricing and capacity  to fund our cash requirements 
we may  at any time  seek to access such markets in the event that we determine that the terms and conditions available to us are advantageous based upon prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other circumstances 
see financial condition for further discussion of our restrictive covenants 
debt transactions 
during  we entered into a million term loan and borrowed million of our available million capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility 
we also refinanced our million mortgage loan on the orlando world center marriott through the issuance of a million floating rate mortgage loan 
in addition  we repurchased million principal amount of our exchangeable senior debentures for approximately million  for a gain of approximately million in as of december   our debt has an average maturity of years and a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition to the above financing activities  we paid approximately million of principal amortization of mortgage debt in and repaid the million mortgage secured by our scottsdale marriott at mcdowell mountains  which matured in december we may continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time  taking advantage of favorable market conditions when available 
we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  a tender offer or  in some cases  through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms 
repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and funds from operations  or ffo per diluted share  as defined below  as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs 
specifically  interest expense includes million for for call premiums  the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discount and the termination of related interest rate swap agreements associated with debt prepayments 
counterparty credit risk 
we are subject to counterparty credit risk  which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price 
as a result of the recent bankruptcy and insolvency of several high profile  well respected financial institutions  we have performed additional assessments to determine the impact  if any  of these market developments on our financial condition 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions  access to our credit facility  the amounts due and services performed by our managers and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts 
currently  our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited 
our exposure with regard to our cash and the million available under our credit facility is mitigated as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions 
amounts due from the managers of our hotels generally reflect the operations of the hotel in the immediately preceding period and the working capital at the hotels 
these amounts totaled million as of december  and we consider the risk that our managers will fail to meet the payment obligations to be remote 
currently  our exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totals million and the counterparties are investment grade financial institutions

as a result of these purchases  we currently have approximately million left under the board s authorization for future repurchases

senior notes general 
the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture 
we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes at specified dates in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lp s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp 
the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and currently are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  as well as our credit facility  certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
because our leverage ratio is below this threshold  we have the right to release all pledges at any time 
in october  we exercised this right for pledges of capital stock that would have been otherwise required subsequent to this date 
restrictive covenants 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture  our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the achievement of an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of at least x by host lp 
furthermore  host lp is able to make distributions to enable host to pay dividends on its preferred stock under the senior notes indenture when our ebitda to interest coverage ratio is above to this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings  as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value  and  in  approximately million of interest expense to be recorded as a result of the adoption of fsp apb relating to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate values excluding intangible assets and secured indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets 
so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture  we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture  including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition 
in addition  even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and pay dividends  we are still permitted to incur certain types of debt  including i credit facility debt  ii refinancing debt  iii up to million of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount  and iv up to million of other debt 
our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters  such as our ability to pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our equity interests  make investments  permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries  sell assets  guarantee indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets as defined in the indenture as undepreciated property value of not less than of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages 
this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or pay dividends discussed above whose consequences  where we fall below the coverage level  are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or pay dividends  but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture 
as of december   we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our senior notes indentures

credit facility general 
on may   we entered into a second amended and restated bank credit facility with deutsche bank ag new york branch  as administrative agent  bank of america  na  as syndication agent  citicorp north america inc  soci t g n rale and calyon new york branch  as co documentation agents and certain other agents and lenders 
the credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of million 
during any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x  new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed million 
the credit facility also includes subcommitments for i the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million and ii loans in certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of million  a million of which may be loaned to certain of our canadian subsidiaries in canadian dollars and b million of which may be loaned to us in pounds sterling and euros 
the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of september we have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met as of september these conditions include the payment of a fee to the lenders  that no default or event of default exists and maintaining a leverage ratio below x 
subject to certain conditions  we also have the option to increase the amount of the facility by up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders  whether or not currently party to the credit facility  commits to be a lender for such amount 
in the second quarter of  we entered into a million term loan under the credit facility 
the term loan bears interest at libor plus basis points  with a libor floor of for an all in rate of at december  we also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight federal funds rate plus basis points and the prime lending rate  plus  in both cases  the applicable spread of basis points 
in september  we also borrowed million under the revolver portion of our credit facility at a rate of libor plus basis points based on our current leverage 
based on our current leverage  we have million of remaining available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility 
the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that certain conditions are satisfied  including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as a result of having satisfied such conditions  currently we are not required to pledge our equity interests in any newly acquired or formed subsidiary  and at our election  we may obtain a release of all existing pledges for so long as our leverage ratio continues to be below x 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility  as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
financial covenants 
the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage 
prior to the end of our third quarter of  we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than x 
thereafter  the maximum leverage ratio under the credit facility is reduced to x  with the minimum unsecured coverage ratio continuing to be set at x 
in all cases  if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x  new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed million 
however  to the extent our borrowings under the credit facility revolver exceed million on the date that our leverage ratio exceeds x  we are not required to repay the excess for one year 
the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility 
hence  so long as there are no amounts outstanding  we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants 
these calculations are performed in accordance with our credit facility based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of the credit facility  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value  and  in  approximately million of interest expense to be recorded as a result of the adoption of fsp apb relating to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of million is deducted from our total debt balance 
as of december   our leverage ratio was x versus the x maximum leverage ratio allowed under the credit facility  our fixed charge coverage ratio was x versus the x minimum fixed charge coverage ratio allowed under the credit facility and our unsecured interest coverage ratio was x versus the minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of x allowed under the credit facility 
accordingly  we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility as of december  the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility financial covenant levels year minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio a maximum leverage ratio b minimum fixed charge coverage ratio a if  at any time our leverage ratio is above x  our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will lower to x 
b the maximum leverage ratio declines to x in september interest and fees 
we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates plus a margin that is set with reference to our leverage ratio 
in the case of libor borrowings in us dollars  as well as euros and pounds sterling denominated borrowings  the rate of interest ranges from basis points to basis points over libor 
we also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight federal funds rate plus basis points and the prime lending rate  plus  in both cases  the applicable spread ranging from to basis points 
based on our current leverage ratio of x  we can borrow at a rate of libor plus basis points or prime plus basis points 
to the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of to basis points  depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period 
other covenants 
the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters 
certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below x 
in particular  at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures  and the limitations on acquisitions  investments and dividends contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture 
additionally  the credit facility s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends are generally consistent with our senior notes indenture 
these provisions  under certain circumstances  limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing  and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain our tax status as a reit 
mortgage and other debt general 
as of december   we had hotels that were secured by mortgage debt 
substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions 
as of december   secured debt represented approximately of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of and an average maturity of years 
the following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and maturities related to mortgage and other debt as of december  in millions balance as of december  thereafter mortgage debt orlando marriott world center   due san diego marriott hotel and marina   due atlanta marriott marquis   due westin kierland   due harbor beach marriott resort and spa   due the ritz carlton  naples and newport beach marriott hotel and spa   due desert springs  a jw marriott resort and spa   due the westin tabor center   due other mortgage debt total mortgage debt other debt philadelphia airport marriott industrial revenue bonds   due industrial revenue bonds and other total other debt total mortgage and other debt this floating rate mortgage is based on libor plus basis points

mortgage debt of consolidated and unconsolidated partner interests for the entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party minority partnership interests  the proportion of mortgage debt included in the above table that is attributable to the minority owners  based on their percentage of ownership of the partnerships  is approximately million 
additionally  we have minority interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method 
the proportion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships attributable to us  based on our percentage of ownership of the partnerships  was million at december  approximately of this debt balance is attributable to our ownership interest in the european joint venture 
the mortgage debt related to our european joint venture hotels contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or make principal repayments without penalty 
the debt of all our unconsolidated partnerships is non recourse to us 
credit ratings currently  we have approximately billion of senior notes outstanding and million of preferred stock that are rated by moody s investors service  standard poor s and fitch ratings 
moody s rating on our senior note debt is ba and our preferred stock is ba during  standard poor s downgraded our senior note debt one notch from bbb  the lowest investment grade rating  to bb 
standard poor s rating on our preferred stock was also downgraded one notch from b to b 
in addition  standard poor s has maintained its negative outlook 
during  fitch ratings downgraded our senior note debt from bb to bb 
the rating on our preferred stock was also downgraded from bb to b 
fitch ratings has also placed us on negative outlook 
if our operations or our credit ratios continue to decline  the ratings on our securities could be further reduced 
if we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings  our cost to issue senior notes  either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise  or additional preferred stock would likely increase 
dividend policy host is required to distribute at least of its annual taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to its stockholders to qualify as a reit  including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash 
funds used by host to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from host lp 
currently  for every share of common and preferred stock of host  host lp has issued to host a corresponding common op unit and preferred op unit 
as of february   host is the owner of substantially all of the preferred op units and approximately of the common op units 
the remaining of the common op units are held by various third party limited partners 
investors should take into account the minority position in host lp common op units when analyzing common and preferred dividend payments by host to its stockholders  as these holders share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding common and preferred op units 
when host pays a common or preferred dividend  host lp pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred op units 
for example  if host paid a per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on payment of a per common unit distribution by host lp to host  as well as to other common op unit holders 
host s current policy on common dividends is generally to distribute  over time  of its taxable income 
we intend to suspend our regular quarterly dividend in and instead we expect to declare a 
to 
per share common dividend in the fourth quarter  which may be paid either in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
the amount of any dividend will be determined by host s board of directors 
in reliance on the specific terms of recent guidance issued by the irs  we may pay up to of our required common dividends with host common stock  with the remaining paid with cash 
host currently intends to continue paying dividends on its preferred stock  regardless of the amount of taxable income  unless contractually restricted

for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a material tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
additionally  under the partnership agreement between host and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by host  as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host 
we do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangements to be material 
tax indemnification agreements 
for reasons relating to federal and state income tax considerations of the former and current owners of three hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
two of these agreements will expire in and the third will expire in guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent certain divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately million as of december  in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which owns and operates a senior living facility 
we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership  but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by barcel crestline corporation  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 
in connection with the sale of two hotels in january  we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately million through the full term of the leases  including renewal options 
we believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote  and in each case  we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel 
information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases  projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total the amounts shown include amortization of principal  debt maturities and estimated interest payments 
interest payments have been included in the long term debt obligations based on the weighted average interest rate 
future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the hpt subleases of approximately million and million  respectively  payable to us under non cancelable subleases 
our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years and some of the amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed 
see capital expenditures 
the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense based upon fin under terms of our management agreements  we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner s priority to us 
the timing of the payments  if any  is based on future operations  the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel  and  is therefore  not determinable 
the estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years based upon fin critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates purchase price allocations to hotels 
investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
any remaining unallocated acquisition costs would be treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
impairment testing 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been impaired  whereby  future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the asset 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge when a property s fair value is less than its net book value 
we test for impairment in several situations  including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  as well as whenever an asset is classified as held for sale or events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s net book value may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows holding period expected useful life future capital expenditures fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  assumptions  future changes in economic conditions  or property level results could require us to record additional impairment charges  which would be reflected in operations in the future 
classification of assets as held for sale 
our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable  will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the planned sale will be withdrawn 
this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed  the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
specifically  we will typically classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met our board of directors has approved the sale to the extent the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
to the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
see the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  of consolidated deferred tax assets as of december  the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of derivative contracts 
we will occasionally enter into derivative products including interest rate and foreign currency swaps  caps and collars 
derivative instruments are fair valued at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss unless the instrument qualifies as a hedge under sfas we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts and guarantees 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
stock compensation 
we recognize costs resulting from our share based payment transactions in our financial statements over their vesting periods 
we classify share based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity classified awards or liability classified awards 
the classification of our restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options 
equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant 
liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
the value of these restricted stock awards  less estimated forfeitures  is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the majority of our restricted stock awards to senior management vested as of december  these awards were classified as liability awards due to settlement features that allowed the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the statutory minimum requirements 
during  we will implement a new employee stock plan for our senior management that will include the following awards restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions 
these awards will be considered liability awards due to their cash settlement features 
therefore  they will be remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
we utilize a simulation  or monte carlo model to determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions 
the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock  risk free interest rates  the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited 
restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions 
these awards are earned based on an employee s achieving a specified performance target  which will be based on the employee s specific management business objectives 
compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable of achievement 
if a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable of achievement  recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome 
these awards are also considered liability awards due to the cash settlement provisions 
therefore  the value of the shares to be issued will be based on the share price on the reporting date 
stock option awards 
the stock option awards will be equity based awards  as they will not include cash settlement features 
therefore  the value of the award will be determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and will not be adjusted for future changes in the fair value 
the utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited 
we also grant restricted stock awards to our upper middle management with vesting based on service conditions 
these awards are considered equity awards as they do not have an option for tax withholding similar to that for senior management 
consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
currently  we have investments in entities that own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting 
these entities are considered to be voting interest entities 
the debt on these investments is non recourse to us and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material 
while we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures presented under the equity method  if we were required to do so  then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements 
application of new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations  fas r 
fas r provides principles on the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
the standard particularly requires the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests to be measured at the acquisition date fair value  including contingent consideration 
furthermore  fas r prohibits acquisition related costs  such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees  from being applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
we will adopt the provisions of this statement beginning in the first quarter of prospectively 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will materially affect the recognition and measurement related to our future business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 fas  which defines a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary as the portion of the equity net assets in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent and requires noncontrolling interest to be presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
fas also modifies the presentation of net income by requiring earnings and other comprehensive income to be attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests 
we will adopt this standard beginning in the first quarter of prospectively and any presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively 
upon the adoption of this standard  we will reclassify interests of our minority partners of other consolidated partnerships from the mezzanine level of the balance sheet to stockholders equity 
interest of minority partners of host lp will continue to be classified in the minority interest section of our balance sheet  as the op units do not meet the requirements for equity classification per eitf topic d upon adoption  the interest of minority partners of host lp will be carried at fair value 
as of december   the balance to be reclassified totaled million 
additionally  the income attributable to minority partners of host lp and other consolidated partnerships will no longer be deducted in our determination of net income and net income would have increased by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
however  the income attributable to minority partners will be deducted in our determination of net income available to common shareholders 
therefore  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our income available to common shareholders or our diluted earnings per share 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp 
fsp specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the instrument s issuance date when interest cost is recognized 
our debentures and our debentures are within the scope of fsp  therefore  we will be required to record the debt components of the debentures at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt 
the implementation of this standard will result in a decrease to net income and earnings per share for all periods presented  however  there is no effect on our cash interest payments 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years and shall be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
early adoption of fsp is not permitted 
as a result of the application of this standard  our diluted earnings per common share are estimated to decrease by approximately 
to 
per share 
additionally  the application of this standard will decrease our debt balance as of december  by approximately million  with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity 
comparable hotel operating statistics we present certain operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues  expenses and adjusted operating profit for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
we define our comparable hotels as properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results  whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption  or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared 
of the hotels that we owned on december   have been classified as comparable hotels 
the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december  are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods atlanta marriott marquis a two year major renovation project that was completed in june  and new orleans marriott property damage and business interruption from hurricane katrina in august 
additionally  the operating results of the eleven hotels we disposed of in and also are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein 
moreover  because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties  they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments 
we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type 
these divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry 
geographic regions consist of the following only states in which we own hotels are listed pacific california  hawaii  oregon and washington  mountain arizona and colorado  north central illinois  indiana  michigan  minnesota  missouri and ohio  south central louisiana  tennessee and texas  new england connecticut  massachusetts and new hampshire  mid atlantic pennsylvania  new jersey and new york  dc metro maryland  virginia and washington  dc  atlanta georgia and north carolina  florida florida  and international canada  mexico and chile 
property types consist of the following urban hotels located in primary business districts of major cities  suburban hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets  resort conference hotels located in resort conference destinations such as arizona  florida  hawaii and southern california  and airport hotels located at or near airports 
reporting periods for consolidated statement of operations 
the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott  the manager of a significant percentage of our properties  uses a year ending on the friday closest to december and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt and starwood  report results on a monthly basis 
host  as a reit  is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott but our fourth quarter ends on december and our full year results  as reported in our statement of operations  always includes the same number of days as the calendar year 
two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for  and note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations 
start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter january march january march january march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september december september december september december while the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott  another consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us 
hence  the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately of total revenues of our hotels 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january  february  second quarter march to may  third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december 
while this does not affect full year results  it does affect the reporting of quarterly results 
for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results 
in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations  our hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and our comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott for our marriott managed hotels 
however  for years such as  where marriott reports its operations based on a week year and a fourth quarter of weeks  for comparable purposes  we exclude the extra week of operations  and we still reflect weeks for the full year and weeks for the fourth quarter 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results will typically differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein 
results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations 
hotel result reporting periods for operating statistics and comparable hotel results for marriott managed properties start end dates no

of days first quarter january march december march december march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september january september december september december non gaap financial measures we use certain non gaap financial measures  which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  within the meaning of applicable sec rules 
they are as follows i ffo per diluted share  and ii comparable hotel operating results 
the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ffo per diluted share we present ffo per diluted share as a non gaap measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate ffo per diluted share for a given operating period as our ffo defined as set forth below for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period 
nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities  including the payment of preferred stock dividends  in accordance with nareit guidelines 
we believe that ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits  even though ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we calculate ffo per diluted share  in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation  capital expenditures and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
ffo per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  ffo per diluted share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to our stockholders benefit 
the following tables provide a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders per share to ffo per diluted share in millions  except per share amounts reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to funds from operations per diluted share year ended december  income shares per share amount income shares per share amount net income available to common stockholders adjustments gain on dispositions  net of taxes gain on insurance settlements a amortization of deferred gains  net of taxes depreciation and amortization partnership adjustments ffo of minority partners of host lp b adjustments for dilutive securities assuming distribution of common shares granted under the comprehensive stock plan less shares assumed purchased at average market price assuming conversion of exchangeable senior debentures c ffo per diluted share d e a represents the gain during the period from the settlement of property insurance claims  including the gains that are included in discontinued operations related to hotels that we have sold

accordingly  the adjustments to dilutive ffo related to the exchangeable senior debentures consist of an add back of million of interest expense netted with the million gain realized on the repurchases  for a net effect of million 
d ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities 
dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans  those preferred op units held by minority partners  convertible debt securities and other minority interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common op units

represents the portion of the significant transactions attributable to minority partners in host lp 
comparable hotel operating results we present certain operating results for our hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses  and adjusted operating profit  on a comparable hotel  or same store basis as supplemental information for investors 
we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization  because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management 
the following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotels for the periods presented herein comparable hotel results a in millions  except hotel statistics year ended december  number of hotels number of rooms percent change in comparable hotel revpar comparable hotel sales room food and beverage c other comparable hotel sales b comparable hotel expenses room food and beverage e other management fees  ground rent and other costs comparable hotel expenses d comparable hotel adjusted operating profit non comparable hotel results  net f office buildings and limited services properties  net g depreciation and amortization corporate and other expenses gain on insurance settlements operating profit per the consolidated statements of operations a the reporting period for for the marriott managed hotels is from december  to december  and for is from december  to december  b the reconciliation of total revenues per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel sales is as follows year ended december  revenues per the consolidated statements of operations non comparable hotel sales hotel sales for the property for which we record rental income rental income for office buildings and select service hotels adjustment for hotel sales for comparable hotels to reflect a week fiscal year for marriott managed hotels comparable hotel sales c the reconciliation of total food and beverage sales per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable food and beverage sales is as follows year ended december  food and beverage sales per the consolidated statements of operations non comparable food and beverage sales food and beverage sales for the property for which we record rental income adjustment for food and beverage sales for comparable hotels to reflect a week fiscal year for marriott managed hotels comparable food and beverage sales d the reconciliation of operating costs per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel expenses is as follows year ended december  operating costs and expenses per the consolidated statements of operations non comparable hotel expenses hotel expenses for the property for which we record rental income rent expense for office buildings and select service hotels adjustment for hotel expenses for comparable hotels to reflect a week fiscal year for marriott managed hotels depreciation and amortization corporate and other expenses gain on property insurance settlements comparable hotel expenses e the reconciliation of total food and beverage expenses per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable food and beverage expenses is as follows year ended december  food and beverage expenses per the consolidated statements of operations non comparable food and beverage expense food and beverage expenses for the property for which we record rental income adjustment for food and beverage expenses for comparable hotels to reflect a week fiscal year for marriott managed hotels comparable food and beverage expenses f non comparable hotel results  net  includes the following items i the results of operations of our non comparable hotels whose operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations as continuing operations and ii the difference between the number of days of operations reflected in the comparable hotel results and the number of days of operations reflected in the consolidated statements of operations

expected maturity date thereafter total fair value in millions liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate variable rate average interest rate total debt the debt maturing in includes million related to borrowings under the credit facility  which can be extended  at our option  for one year if our leverage ratio is below x 
see financial condition for further discussion 
similarly  the million mortgage loan on the orlando world center marriott  which also matures in  can be extended for two one year periods  subject to achieving a certain debt coverage ratio and other conditions 
our current debt structure  which primarily consists of fixed rate debt largely mitigates the impact of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments 
as of december   we had a million term loan and million outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility 
our credit facility borrowings are sensitive to changes in interest rates  and are based on a spread over libor  ranging from basis points to basis points depending on our leverage ratio 
additionally  in we entered into a million floating rate mortgage loan on our orlando world center marriott that bears interest at libor plus basis points 
valuations for secured debt and the credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk adjusted rates 
senior notes and the exchangeable senior debentures are valued based on quoted market prices 
during march  we prepaid our million mortgage on the jw marriott  washington  dc as a result  we terminated an interest rate cap that capped the floating interest rate of the loan at 
the cap represented a derivative that was marked to market each period and the gains and losses from changes in the market value of the cap were recorded in gain loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by basis points  the change in interest expense would change future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
exchange rate sensitivity as we have non us operations specifically  the ownership of hotels in canada  mexico and chile and investments in our european joint venture  currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business 
to manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non us hotels  where possible  we may enter into forward or option contracts 
the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes 
during  we have entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling million approximately million to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the european joint venture 
under these transactions  we will sell the euro amount  and receive the us dollar amount on the forward purchase date 
these derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  and  in accordance with sfas  are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders equity portion of our balance sheet 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps 
during  we recorded an increase in the fair value of the derivative instruments totaling approximately million  which is equal to the fair value as of december  included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the following table summarizes our three foreign currency purchase contracts in millions transaction date transaction amount in euros transaction amount in dollars forward purchase date february august february february may may
