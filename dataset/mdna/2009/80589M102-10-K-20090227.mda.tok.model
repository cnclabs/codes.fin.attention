key earnings drivers and outlook the southeast has suffered from the effects of a recession that has progressively worsened during at december  preliminary estimates of unemployment for the states in which the company provides service have ranged from in georgia to in south carolina 
while customer growth remained positive throughout in most regulated business segments  the rate of growth slowed considerably 
in addition  the regulated business segments began to experience declines in customer usage in our nonregulated natural gas marketer experienced a reduction in retail customers of approximately during the year due primarily to intensified competition 
the company expects the recession to continue well into  if not longer  and cannot determine when or if customer growth and usage trends may return to pre levels 
over the next five years  key earnings drivers for the company will be additions to rate base at south carolina electric gas company sce g  carolina gas transmission corporation cgtc and public service company of north carolina  incorporated psnc energy  consisting primarily of capital expenditures for environmental facilities  new generating capacity and system expansion 
other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment  customer growth and usage in each of the regulated utility businesses  earnings in the natural gas marketing business in georgia and the level of growth of operation and maintenance expenses 
electric operations the electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of sce g  south carolina generating company  inc genco and south carolina fuel company  inc fuel company  and is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in south carolina 
at december  sce g provided electricity to  customers in an area covering nearly  square miles 
genco owns a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to sce g 
fuel company acquires  owns and provides financing for sce g s nuclear fuel  fossil fuel and emission allowance requirements 
operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity  the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
sce g s allowed return on equity may not exceed 
demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather  customer growth and the economy 
sce g is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills  but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and  therefore  the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources 
in  sce g contracted with westinghouse electric company llc and stone webster  inc for the design and construction of two  megawatt nuclear electric generating units at the site of v 
c 
summer nuclear station summer station 
sce g and south carolina public service authority santee cooper will be joint owners and share operating costs and generation output of the two additional units  with sce g accounting for percent of the cost and output and santee cooper the remaining percent 
assuming timely receipt of federal and state approvals and construction proceeding as scheduled  the first unit is expected to be completed and in service in  the second in the successful completion of the project would result in an increase of the company s utility plant in service of approximately over its level 
financing and managing the construction of these plants  together with continuing environmental construction projects  represents a significant challenge to the company 

table of contents on february  the scpsc approved sce g s combined application pursuant to the base load review act the blra  seeking a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity and for a base load review order  relating to proposed construction by sce g and santee cooper to build and operate two new nuclear generating units at summer station 
under the blra  the scpsc conducted a full pre construction prudency review of the proposed units and the engineering  procurement and construction contract under which they will be built 
the scpsc prudency finding is binding on all future related rate proceedings so long as the construction proceeds in accordance with the schedules  estimates and projections  including contingencies set forth in the approved application 
in addition  beginning with the initial proceeding  sce g will be allowed to file revised rates with the scpsc each year to incorporate any nuclear construction work in progress incurred 
requested rate adjustments would be based on sce g s updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed return on common equity of 
on february  the scpsc approved the initial rate increase of million or related to recovery of the cost of capital on project expenditures through june  on march   sce g submitted a combined construction and operating license col application to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
this col application for the two new units was reviewed for completeness by the nrc and docketed on july  on september  the nrc issued a thirty month review schedule from the docketing date to the issuance of the safety evaluation report which would signify satisfactory completion of their review 
both the environmental and safety reviews by the nrc continue to be in progress and should support a col issuance by july this date would support both the project schedule and the substantial completion dates for the two new units in and  respectively 
the company expects that significant legislative or regulatory initiatives will be undertaken  particularly at the federal level 
these initiatives may require the company to build or otherwise acquire generating capacity from energy sources that exclude fossil fuels  nuclear or hydro facilities for example  under a renewable portfolio standard or rps 
new legislation or regulations may also impose stringent requirements on existing power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides and mercury 
it is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
the company cannot predict whether such legislation or regulations will be enacted  and if they are  the conditions they would impose on utilities 
gas distribution the gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of sce g and psnc energy and is primarily engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
at december  this segment provided natural gas to  customers in areas covering  square miles 
operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather  customer growth  the economy and  for commercial and industrial customers  the availability and price of alternate fuels 
natural gas competes with electricity  propane and heating oil to serve the heating and  to a lesser extent  other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers 
this competition is generally based on price and convenience 
large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel  such as propane or fuel oil 
natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price 
as a result  any significant disparity between supply and demand  either of natural gas or of alternate fuels  and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors  will affect price and impact the company s ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers 
significant supply disruptions occurred in september and october as a result of hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico  resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements 
while supply disruptions have not been experienced since  the price of natural gas remains volatile and has resulted in short term competitive pressure 
the long term impact of volatile gas prices and gas supply has not been determined 
gas transmission cgtc operates an open access  transportation only interstate pipeline company regulated by the united states federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
cgtc s operating results are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
demand for cgtc s services is closely linked to demand for natural gas and is affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
cgtc provides transportation services to sce g for its gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs and to scana energy marketing  inc semi for natural gas marketing 
cgtc also provides transportation services to other natural gas utilities  municipalities and county gas authorities and to industrial customers 

table of contents retail gas marketing scana energy  a division of semi  comprises the retail gas marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas to approximately  customers as of december   and including regulated division customers described below throughout georgia 
scana energy s total customer base represents approximately a share of the approximately million customers in georgia s deregulated natural gas market 
scana energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state 
scana energy s competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in georgia s energy market  as well as several electric membership cooperatives 
scana energy s ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors  its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors 
as georgia s regulated provider  scana energy serves low income customers and customers unable to obtain or maintain natural gas service from other marketers at rates approved by the georgia public service commission gpsc  and it receives funding from the universal service fund to help offset some of the bad debt associated with the low income group 
scana energy s contract to serve as georgia s regulated provider of natural gas ends on august  two marketers  including scana energy  have made a bid with the gpsc to be the regulated service provider after scana energy s current contract expires 
scana energy expects a decision in march scana energy files financial and other information periodically with the gpsc  and such information is available at www

at december   scana energy s regulated division served over  customers 
scana energy and scana s other natural gas distribution and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and other financial instruments  including commodity swaps and futures contracts  to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a part of this risk management process  at any given time  a portion of scana s projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract 
since scana energy operates in a competitive market  it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing  thereby reducing expected margins and profitability 
further  there can be no assurance that georgia s gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions evolve 
energy marketing the divisions of semi  excluding scana energy energy marketing  comprise the energy marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to customers 
the operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
in addition  certain pipeline capacity available for energy marketing to serve industrial and other customers is dependent upon the market share held by scana energy in the retail market 
results of operations the company reports earnings as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
management believes that  in addition to reported earnings under gaap  the company s gaap adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of its fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period over period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data 
in management s opinion  gaap adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the company s primary businesses 
this measure is also a basis for management s provision of earnings guidance and growth projections  and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions 
this non gaap performance measure is not intended to replace the gaap measure of net earnings  but is offered as a supplement to it 
a reconciliation of reported gaap earnings per share to gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share is provided in the table below reported gaap earnings per share deduct cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax reduction in charge related to propane litigation gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share cash dividends declared per share 
table of contents discussion of above adjustments the cumulative effect of an accounting change resulted from the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the reduction in charge related to propane litigation resulted from litigation arising from the prior sale of the company s propane business being settled for an amount that was less than had been accrued previously 
this reduction appears in the income statement as a reduction to other expenses 
management believes that these adjustments are appropriate in determining the non gaap financial performance measure 
management utilizes such measure in exercising budgetary control  managing business operations and determining eligibility for certain incentive compensation payments 
the non gaap measure  gaap adjusted net earnings per share from operations  provides a consistent basis upon which to measure performance by excluding the cumulative effect on per share earnings of the accounting change resulting from the company s adoption of sfas r and the effect on per share earnings of litigation related to the sale of a prior business 
pension income pension income was recorded on the company s financial statements as follows millions of dollars income statement impact reduction in employee benefit costs other income balance sheet impact reduction in capital expenditures component of amount due to summer station co owner total pension income the company expects to record significant amounts of pension expense in compared to the pension income recorded in this unfavorable change is expected due to the significant decline in plan asset values during the fourth quarter of stemming from turmoil in the financial markets 
however  the company does not expect that a contribution to the pension trust will be necessary in or for  nor does the company expect limitations on benefit payments to apply 
additionally  in february  the company was granted accounting orders by the scpsc which will allow it to mitigate a significant portion of this increased pension expense by deferring as a regulatory asset the amount of pension expense above that which is included in current rates for both of the company s south carolina regulated businesses 
these costs will be deferred until future rate filings  at which time the accumulated deferred costs will be addressed prospectively

recognition of synthetic fuel tax credits sce g held equity method investments in two partnerships that were involved in converting coal to synthetic fuel  the use of which fuel qualified for federal income tax credits 
under an accounting methodology approved by the scpsc  construction costs related to the lake murray back up dam project were recorded in utility plant in service in a special dam remediation account  outside of rate base  and accelerated depreciation was recognized against the balance in this account  subject to the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits 
the synthetic fuel tax credit program expired at the end of for and  the level of depreciation expense and related tax benefit recognized in the income statement was equal to the available synthetic fuel tax credits  less partnership losses and other expenses  net of taxes

scana  through a subsidiary  provided management and maintenance services for a non affiliated synthetic fuel production facility 
these services ceased on december   concurrent with the expiration of the synthetic fuel tax credit program 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements for scana s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs  funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to scana 
the ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations  will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  rate increases will be sought 
the future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief 

table of contents challenging conditions during tested the company s liquidity and its ability to access short term funding sources 
during this period  all of the banks in the company s revolving credit facilities fully funded draws requested of them 
as of december   the company had drawn approximately million from its billion facilities  had approximately million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding and approximately million in cash and temporary investments 
the company regularly monitors the commercial paper and short term credit markets to optimize the timing for repayment of the outstanding balance on its draws  while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity 
at december   the company had net available liquidity of approximately million  and the company s revolving credit facilities are in place until december the company s overall debt portfolio has weighted average maturity of over thirteen years and bears an average cost of 
all long term debt  other than facility draws  bears fixed interest rates 
to further preserve liquidity  the company rigorously reviewed its projected capital expenditures and operating costs for and adjusted them where possible without impacting safety  reliability  and core customer service 
the company also obtains cash from scana s stock plans 
since july   shares of scana common stock purchased on behalf of participants in scana s investor plus plan and stock purchase savings plan have been acquired through original issue shares  rather than on the open market 
this provided over million of additional cash during and is expected to provide approximately million annually for and forward 
due primarily to new nuclear construction plans  the company anticipates keeping this strategy in place for the foreseeable future 
on january   scana closed on the sale of million shares of its common stock  raising approximately million 
with the reduction of capital expenditures planned for and planned operating cost reductions in response to current economic conditions  this transaction makes it unlikely that scana will need to raise additional equity in beyond that issued through scana s stock plans 
scana s leverage ratio of debt to capital was approximately at december  scana has publicly announced its desire to achieve a leverage ratio at to  but scana s ability to do so depends on a number of factors 
if scana is not able to maintain its leverage ratio  the company s debt ratings may be affected  it may be required to pay higher interest rates on its long and short term indebtedness  and its access to the capital markets may be limited

four other banks provide the remaining 
these bank credit facilities support the issuance of commercial paper by sce g including fuel company and psnc energy 
in addition  a portion of the credit facilities supports scana s borrowing needs 
when the commercial paper markets are dislocated due to either price or availability constraints  the credit facilities are available to support the borrowing needs of sce g including fuel company and psnc energy 
in mid september  a very severe dislocation of the commercial paper  long term debt and equity markets occurred as concerns over bank solvency adversely impacted the credit markets 
access by sce g  fuel company and psnc energy to the commercial paper markets was very limited 
commercial paper outstanding was significantly reduced  and the interest rates on commercial paper outstanding significantly increased 
generally  sce g  fuel company and psnc energy were only able to issue commercial paper for one week terms  much shorter periods than their prior customary one month terms 
in response to the credit market disruption  the federal reserve created a commercial paper funding facility cpff to provide liquidity to the commercial paper market by increasing the availability of funding to certain commercial paper issuers 
however  the cpff  which became active in the market on october   only provides such funding to issuers of tier commercial paper issuers with credit ratings of a  p  f 
while sce g  fuel company and psnc energy  as tier issuers with credit ratings of a  p  f  do not qualify for the cpff program  the company expected that  over time  the enhanced liquidity in the tier commercial paper market would positively affect the tier commercial paper market 
as a result of the limited access to commercial paper  sce g  fuel company and psnc energy accessed their credit facilities with banks described above and drawn down funds to replace maturing commercial paper 
since year end  access to the commercial paper market has improved and interest rates have declined significantly 
although these improvements in the commercial paper market have occurred  draws against the revolving credit facilities have been maintained as the interest rates on these draws continue to remain favorable 
access to the debt capital markets was also very limited 
sce g took advantage of a narrow window of market opportunity and issued million of its first mortgage bonds at a coupon of on october  issuers found limited opportunities to issue secured long term debt and only at increased interest rates 
since year end  however  as the equity markets have deteriorated  the capital markets  particularly in secured long term bonds of utility companies  have improved 
currently  opportunities to issue unsecured long term debt still appear to be more limited  although improved since year end 
the company cannot determine how long this dislocation of the credit markets will last 
the company expects that the risks of a global recession may continue to hamper the economy and adversely affect the capital markets 

table of contents scana s restated articles of incorporation do not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock

scana corporation scana has in effect an indenture which permits the issuance of unsecured debt securities from time to time including its medium term note debt securities 
this indenture contains no specific limit on the amount of unsecured debt securities which may be issued 
south carolina electric gas company sce g is subject to a bond indenture dated april  mortgage covering substantially all of its electric properties under which all of its first mortgage bonds bonds have been issued 
bonds may be issued under the mortgage in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the sum of of unfunded net property additions as therein defined  the aggregate principal amount of retired bonds and cash deposited with the trustee 
bonds  other than certain bonds issued on the basis of retired bonds  will be issuable under the mortgage only if adjusted net earnings as therein defined for consecutive months out of the months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding bonds and bonds to be outstanding bond ratio 
for the year ended december   the bond ratio was 
sce g s restated articles of incorporation articles prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings as therein defined for the consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue preferred stock ratio 
for the year ended december   the preferred stock ratio was the articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of sce g s preferred stock before sce g may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if  after such issue or assumption  the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of sce g s secured indebtedness and capital and surplus the ten percent test 
no such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal  interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes 
at december   the ten percent test would have limited total issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately million 
unsecured indebtedness at december   totaled million  and comprised both long and short term borrowings 
financing activities during the company experienced net cash inflows related to financing activities of million primarily due to issuances of long term debt and common stock  partially offset by repayment of short term debt and payment of dividends 
in june scana entered into an agreement to issue and sell floating rate senior notes due june   in an aggregate principal amount of between million and million 
in each of december and scana issued million of the floating rate senior notes 
the balance of the notes are to be issued in june in the fourth quarter of scana entered into a forward starting swap agreement with a notional amount of million in anticipation of the june issuance 
at december  the estimated fair value of the forward starting interest rate swap totaled million loss 
on january   sce g issued million of first mortgage bonds bearing an annual interest rate of and maturing on january  proceeds from the sale of these bonds were used to repay short term debt primarily incurred as a result of sce g s construction program and for general corporate purposes 
concurrent with this issuance  sce g terminated year forward starting swaps having an aggregate notional amount of million 
the resulting loss of approximately million on the settlement of these swaps will be amortized over the life of the bonds

the new dividend is payable april  to stockholders of record on march environmental matters the company s regulated operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state authorities in the areas of air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes 
applicable statutes and rules include the clean air act  as amended caa  the clean air interstate rule cair  the clean water act  the nuclear waste policy act of nuclear waste act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  among others 
compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs  which the company expects to recover through existing ratemaking provisions 
for the three years ended december   the company s capital expenditures for environmental control totaled million 
these expenditures were in addition to environmental expenditures included in other operation and maintenance expenses  which were million during  million during  and million during it is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters  but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the company are million for and million for the four year period these expenditures are included in the company s estimated capital expenditures table  discussed in liquidity and capital resources  and include the matters discussed below 
in addition  the company is monitoring federal legislative proposals that  among other things  may require significant reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions widely believed to contribute to global climate change 
such legislation could impose a tax based on the carbon content of fossil fuels used by the company  such as coal and natural gas 
other proposals call for implementation of a cap and trade program as a means of meeting stringent new emissions standards 
a national mandatory rps may also be considered 
under an rps  electric utilities would be required to generate a specific percentage of their power from sources deemed to be climate friendly  such as solar  wind  geothermal and agricultural waste  over varying periods of time 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these proposals 

table of contents at the state level  no significant environmental legislation that would affect the company s operations advanced during the company cannot predict whether such legislation will be introduced or enacted in  or if new regulations or changes to existing regulations at the state or federal level will be implemented in the coming year 
air quality the united states environmental protection agency epa issued a final rule in known as cair 
cair requires the district of columbia and states  including south carolina  to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels 
cair set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nitrogen oxide and beginning in and  respectively  for sulfur dioxide 
numerous states  environmental organizations  industry groups and individual companies challenged the rule  seeking a change in the method cair used to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances 
on december   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit remanded the rule without vacatur 
prior to the court of appeals decision  sce g and genco had determined that additional air quality controls would be needed to meet the cair requirements  including the installation of selective catalytic reactor scr technology at cope station for nitrogen oxide reduction and wet limestone scrubbers at both wateree and williams stations for sulfur dioxide reduction 
sce g and genco have already begun to install this equipment  and expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately million through the company cannot predict when the epa will issue a revised rule or what impact the rule will have on sce g and genco 
any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the epa in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates 
in the epa issued the clean air mercury rule camr which established a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants 
numerous parties challenged the rule  and on february   the united states circuit court for the district of columbia vacated the rule for electric utility steam generating units 
the company expects the epa to issue a new mercury emissions rule but cannot predict when such a rule will be issued or what requirements it will impose 
the epa has undertaken an enforcement initiative against the utilities industry  and the united states department of justice doj has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the caa 
at least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decided neither favorable to the industry 
one of the decisions is not believed to be binding as precedent and the other one  described more fully below  may be 
on april   in a unanimous ruling  the us supreme court vacated a decision by the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit that effectively halted the epa enforcement action against duke energy corporation duke for allegedly performing plant modifications without a required permit 
such modifications for life extension and modernization as performed by duke and other utilities  including sce g  were common within the industry 
hence this decision may heighten the potential exposure of utilities to enforcement actions such as those already brought against duke and others  many of which had not proceeded pending this supreme court decision 
the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
prior to the suits  those utilities had received requests for information under section of the caa and were issued notices of violation 
the basis for these suits is the assertion by the epa  under a stringent rule known as new source review nsr  that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly best available control technology bact 
sce g and genco have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the regulations under the caa provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications  including an exemption for routine repair  replacement or maintenance 
on october   epa published a final revised nsr rule in the federal register with an effective date of december  the rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the nsr enforcement initiative 
however  on motion of several northeastern states  the united states circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia stayed the effect of the final rule 
the ultimate application of the final rule to the company is uncertain 
the company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the epa s requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair  replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation 
the regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth 
the current state of continued doj enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation  but it is possible that the epa will commence enforcement actions against sce g and genco  and the epa has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to  per day for each violation 
the epa also could seek installation of bact or equivalent at the three plants 
the company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the company compliance with caa would be without merit 
the company further believes that installation of equipment responsive to cair previously discussed will mitigate many of the concerns with nsr 

table of contents water quality the clean water act  as amended cwa  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges 
under the cwa  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all  and renewed for nearly all  of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges  has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures  and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives 
congress is expected to consider further amendments to the cwa 
such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards 
these provisions  if passed  could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company  sce g and genco 
hazardous and solid wastes the nuclear waste act required that the united states government accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by january  the nuclear waste act also imposed on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available 
sce g entered into a standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and or high level radioactive waste with the united states department of energy doe in as of december   the federal government has not accepted any spent fuel from summer station or any other utility  and it remains unclear when the repository may become available 
sce g has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of summer station through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available 
the provisions of cercla authorize the epa to require the clean up of hazardous waste sites 
in addition  the states of south carolina and north carolina have similar laws 
the company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean up 
in addition  regulators from the epa and other federal or state agencies periodically notify the company that it may be required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a hazardous waste site 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and clean up relate solely to regulated operations 
such amounts are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates 
the company has assessed the following matters electric operations sce g has been named  along with others  by the epa as a potentially responsible party prp at the alternate energy resources  inc aer superfund site located in augusta  georgia 
the epa placed the site on the national priorities list in april aer conducted hazardous waste storage and treatment operations from to  when the site was abandoned 
while operational  aer processed fuels from waste oils  treated industrial coolants and oil water emulsions  recycled solvents and blended hazardous waste fuels 
during that time  sce g occasionally used aer for the processing of waste solvents  oily rags and oily wastewater 
the epa and the state of georgia have documented that a release or releases have occurred at the site leading to contamination of groundwater  surface water and soils 
the epa and the state of georgia have conducted a preliminary assessment and site inspection 
the prps funded a remedial investigation and risk assessment which was completed and approved by the epa  and funded a feasibility study that is expected to be completed in the site has not been remediated nor has a clean up cost been estimated 
although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the prps is unclear  sce g does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
any cost allocated to sce g arising from the remediation of this site  net of insurance recovery  is expected to be recoverable through rates 
gas distribution sce g is responsible for four decommissioned manufactured gas plant mgp sites in south carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals 
these sites are in various stages of investigation  remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by the south carolina department of health and environmental control dhec 
sce g anticipates that major remediation activities at these sites will continue until and will cost an additional million 
in addition  the national park service of the department of the interior made an initial demand to sce g for payment of million for certain costs and damages relating to the mgp site in charleston  south carolina 
sce g expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of these four sites  net of insurance recovery  through rates 
at december   deferred amounts  net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements  totaled million 

table of contents psnc energy is responsible for environmental clean up at five sites in north carolina on which mgp residuals are present or suspected 
psnc energy s actual remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors  such as actual site conditions  third party claims and recoveries from other prps 
psnc energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of million  the estimated remaining liability at december  psnc energy expects to recover through rates any costs  net of insurance recovery  allocable to psnc energy arising from the remediation of these sites

fifty percent of these miles of pipeline were required to be assessed by december  and the remainder by december through december  psnc energy has assessed eighty five percent of the pipeline 
depending on the assessment method used  psnc energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline approximately every seven years 
though cost estimates for this program were developed using various assumptions  each of which is subject to imprecision  psnc energy currently estimates the total cost through december to be million for the initial assessments  not including any subsequent remediation that may be required

though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions  each of which is subject to imprecision  cgtc currently estimates the total cost to be million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through december critical accounting policies and estimates following are descriptions of the company s accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents utility regulation scana s regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated 
in the future  as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment  the company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity or financial position of the company s electric distribution and gas distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  including those associated with the company s environmental assessment program 
the company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in those assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and  if they are  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december   the company s net investments in fossil hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately billion and million  respectively 
revenue recognition and unbilled revenues revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers 
because customers of the company s utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters  the company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period 
such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters 
such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class  the effects of different rate schedules  changes in weather and  where applicable  the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures 
the accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs 
accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of million at december  and million at december   compared to total revenues of billion and billion for the years and  respectively 
provisions for bad debts and allowances for doubtful accounts as of each balance sheet date  the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts  assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts  credit scores for residential customers in georgia when available  and consideration of actual write off history 
the distribution segments of the company s regulated utilities have established write off histories and service areas that tend to improve the recoverability of accounts and enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provisions for bad debts 
additionally  under regulatory authority the sce g gas and psnc energy businesses are able to assign the commodity cost portion of their write offs to their gas cost recovery mechanisms 
the company s retail gas marketing segment operates in georgia s deregulated natural gas market in which customers may obtain service from others without necessarily paying outstanding amounts and in which there are certain limitations on the company s ability to effect timely shut off of service for nonpayment 
as such  estimation of the provision for bad debts for these accounts is subject to greater imprecision 
nuclear decommissioning accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
among the factors that could change sce g s accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology  changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements  and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows 
changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the company s financial position and cash flows although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral  because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers 

table of contents sce g s two thirds share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for summer station  including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination  totals million  stated in dollars 
santee cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in summer station 
the cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use 
under sce g s method of funding decommissioning costs  amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain company personnel 
sce g transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates  insurance proceeds  and interest on proceeds  less expenses 
the trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies held by the trust 
management intends for the fund  including earnings thereon  to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the company follows sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as amended by sfas  employees accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  in accounting for the cost of its defined benefit pension plan 
the company s plan is adequately funded under current regulations and as such  net pension income is reflected in the financial statements see results of operations pension income 
sfas requires the use of several assumptions  the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded 
among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets 
net pension income of million recorded in reflects the use of a discount rate  derived using a cash flow matching technique  and an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company believes that these assumptions were  and that the resulting pension income amount was  reasonable 
for purposes of comparison  using a discount rate of in would have increased the company s pension income by million 
had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been  the company s pension income for would have been reduced by million 
the following information with respect to pension assets and returns thereon should also be noted 
the company determines the fair value of a majority of its pension assets utilizing market quotes  with the remaining fair value derived from modeling techniques that incorporate market data 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluates historical performance  targeted allocation amounts and expected payment terms 
as of the beginning of  the plan s historical   and year cumulative performance showed actual returns of   and  respectively  and the expected long term rate of return of was based on a target asset allocation of with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate 
for  the expected rate of return is 
as noted in results of operations  due to turmoil in the financial markets and the resultant declines in plan asset values in the fourth quarter of  the company expects to record significant amounts of pension expense in compared to the pension income recorded in and previously 
however  in february  the company was granted accounting orders by the scpsc which will allow it to mitigate a significant portion of this increased pension expense by deferring as a regulatory asset the amount of pension expense above that which is included in current rates for both of the company s south carolina regulated businesses 
these costs will be deferred until future rate filings  at which time the accumulated deferred costs will be addressed prospectively 
the pension trust is adequately funded under current regulations  and no contributions have been required since management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after similar to its pension accounting  the company follows sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as amended by sfas  in accounting for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits 
this plan is unfunded  so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded  however  the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense 
the company used a discount rate of  derived using a cash flow matching technique  and recorded a net sfas cost of million for had the selected discount rate been  the expense for would have been million higher 
because the plan provisions include caps on company per capita costs  healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded 
asset retirement obligations sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  together with financial accounting standards board interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets aro 
sfas applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition  construction  development and normal operation 
because such obligation relates primarily to the company s regulated utility operations  sfas and fin have no significant impact on results of operations 
as of december   the company has recorded an aro of million for nuclear plant decommissioning as discussed above and an aro of million for other conditional obligations related to generation  transmission and distribution properties  including gas pipelines 
all of the amounts recorded in connection with sfas and fin are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision  particularly since such payments will be made many years in the future 
changes in these estimates will be recorded over time  however  these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the company s utilities remains in place 
other matters off balance sheet transactions although scana invests in securities and business ventures  it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  or as described in fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
scana does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions  although it is party to incidental operating leases in the normal course of business  generally for office space  furniture  equipment and rail cars
