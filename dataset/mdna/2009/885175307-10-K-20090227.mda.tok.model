incision 
our incision products include devices used to obtain a patient s blood sample for diagnostic testing and screening for platelet function 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of  and any associated risks related to  these policies and estimates on our business operations are discussed below 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales for our cardiovascular and itc business divisions when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales to distributors are recorded when title transfers upon shipment 
a reserve for sales returns is recorded for sales through the distributor applying reasonable estimates of product returns based upon historical experience 
we recognize sales of certain cardiovascular division products to first time customers when we have determined that the customer has the ability to use the products 
these sales frequently include the sale of products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
training is not considered essential to the functionality of the products 
the amount of revenue under these arrangements allocated to training is based upon fair market value of the training  which is typically performed on our behalf by third party providers 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated to the training and the cardiovascular division products based on the relative fair market value of the training and products 
in determining when to recognize revenue  management makes decisions on such matters as the fair values of the product and training elements when sold together  customer credit worthiness and warranty reserves 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets or the recorded product sales could be significantly different  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any fiscal period 
reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments owed to us for product sales and training services 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the majority of our products are covered by up to a two year limited manufacturer s warranty from the date of shipment or installation 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when the related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of product sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
in determining the warranty reserve estimate  management makes judgments and estimates on such matters as repair costs and probability of warranty obligations 
the change in accrued warranty expense is summarized in the following table balance charges to balance beginning costs and warranty end of year expenses expenditures of year in thousands fiscal year ended fiscal year ended fiscal year ended 
table of contents estimated excess and obsolete inventory reserves are recorded when inventory levels exceed projected sales volume for a certain period of time 
in determining the excess obsolete reserve  management makes judgments and estimates on matters such as forecasted sales volume 
if sales volume differs from projection  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
management must make judgments to determine the amount of reserves to accrue 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  our consolidated financial statement could be materially and adversely affected 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  such as tax benefits from our non us operations and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  on going tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
conversely  in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for uncertain tax positions for anticipated audit adjustments by united states federal  state and local  as well as foreign  tax authorities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes  interest and penalties may be due 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the accrued liabilities are no longer warranted 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
evaluation of purchased intangibles and goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets subject to amortization  when events or circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
management must make estimates of these future cash flows  if necessary  and the approximate discount rate  and if any of these estimates proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets on our consolidated balance sheets could become significantly impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  such assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
if there is an apparent impairment  a new fair value would be determined 
if the new fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recognized 
valuation of share based awards we account for share based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  expected forfeitures and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes option pricing model for option grants is based on historical volatility 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

table of contents fair value measurements we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  on december  sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  we use various approaches  including market  income and or cost approaches  and each of these approaches requires certain inputs 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions as compared to the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include broker dealer quote securities that can be traded in an active market 
we used level i assumptions for cash and cash equivalents 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  a significant degree of judgment is not required 
level valuations based on quoted prices of similar investments in active markets  of similar or identical investments in markets that are not active or model based valuations for which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable  directly or indirectly 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs primarily include municipal bonds and for the straight convertible debt feature of our senior subordinated convertible notes  except the make whole provision  using a level input  described below 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include certain auction rate securities  our levitronix convertible debenture and the make whole feature of our senior subordinated convertible notes 
given the current credit market illiquidity for auction rate securities  our estimates are subject to significant judgment by management 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are developed to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our financial assets that are accounted for at fair value 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had an active market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
after determining the fair value of our available for sale security  gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in available for sale securities  these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer  the issuer s credit rating  and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full  and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be incorrect  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations 
in addition  if we decide not to hold an investment until maturity  it may result in the recognition of an other than temporary impairment 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated and as a percentage of total product sales for the fiscal years ended in thousands  except percentages product sales cost of product sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of purchased intangible assets purchased in process research and development litigation total operating expenses income loss from operations other income and expense interest expense interest income and other income before taxes income tax expense benefit net income product sales product sales in increased million or as compared to and in increased million or as compared to for the fiscal years ended annual percentage change in thousands cardiovascular itc total product sales in as compared to  cardiovascular product sales increased by million primarily due to higher sales from our heartmate product line 
the higher sales resulted from increased heartmate ii volume in north america and europe  a commercial price increase for the heartmate ii in north america  and higher stocking revenue associated with the addition of fifty five new heartmate ii centers 
also  product sales increased because of favorable foreign currency translation and higher centrimag sales due to increased implant activity 
this increase in product sales was partially offset by a decline in the sales of the thoratec product line due to heartmate ii cannibalization 
itc product sales increased by million primarily due to higher domestic and international sales of our hemochron product line and higher international sales of our alternate site product line  partly offset by the decrease of our incision product line sales due to competitive offerings affecting both volume and selling price 
in as compared to  cardiovascular product sales increased by million  primarily due to increased sales of heartmate ii  partially offset by lower sales in our thoratec product line as a result of increased usage of short term devices 
in addition  a full year of product sales of centrimag in totaling million  contributed to the overall increase in product sales as compared to the three month of sales in itc product sales increased by million  primarily due to increased sales of our hospital point of care products along with increased sales of our alternate site and incision products resulting from market expansion and competitor product recalls 
in addition  product sales of avoximeters also contributed to the increase in sales in as opposed to only fourth quarter sales in 
table of contents sales originating outside of the united states and us export sales accounted for approximately  and of our total product sales in  and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit and gross margin are as follows for the fiscal years ended annual percentage change in thousands total gross profit total gross margin in as compared to  cardiovascular gross margin percentage increased by primarily due to increased heartmate ii prices in north america  favorable foreign currency translations  partially offset by the increased percentage of non pump revenue and unfavorable manufacturing variances 
itc gross margin percentage decreased by due to unfavorable geographic and product mix and increased unfavorable manufacturing variances 
in as compared to  cardiovascular gross margin decreased by due to unfavorable non pump product mix and manufacturing variances partially offset by improved foreign currency exchange from our international operations 
itc gross margin was the same for and  due to lower product costs offset by higher costs from product and geographic mix and the expenses related to the voluntary pro time recall 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to and increased million in as compared to for the fiscal years ended annual percentage change in thousands total selling  general and administrative in as compared to  cardiovascular costs increased by million  primarily due to market development initiatives and commercialization efforts associated with the heartmate ii and higher compensation expense 
itc costs increased million  primarily due to higher sales and marketing personnel and travel costs 
corporate costs increased by million  primarily due to higher compensation and various other corporate expenses 
in as compared to  cardiovascular costs increased by million  primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses in related to market expansion and preparation for heartmate ii commercial approval  unfavorable foreign currency exchange and an increase in share based compensation expenses 
itc costs increased by million  primarily due to higher personnel costs  consulting fees and an increase in reserves for overdue accounts receivable 
in addition  in our itc division incurred costs related to the avoximeter products for the full year as compared to selling costs incurred in for the fourth quarter only 
corporate costs increased by million  because of higher consulting and legal expenses related to the review of our stock option granting practices conducted during the first quarter of  market research and compliance costs 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in research and development expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in for the fiscal years ended annual percentage change in thousands total research and development expenses research and development costs are largely project driven  and fluctuate based on the level of project activity planned and subsequently approved and conducted 
in as compared to  research and development costs increased million 
cardiovascular costs increased million  primarily due to increased research and development costs associated with our heartmate product line peripheral enhancements and new product technology 
itc costs increased million  primarily due to new product development 
in as compared to  research and development costs increased million 
cardiovascular costs increased million  primarily due to regulatory and clinical costs associated with phase ii of the heartmate ii pivotal trial and heartmate ii product development 
itc costs increased million  primarily due to higher personnel and consulting costs related to new product development 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million as compared to million in the million increase resulted from decreasing the estimated useful lives of certain of our intangible assets at our cardiovascular division at the beginning of fiscal year amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million as compared to million in the million increase is attributable to higher amortization of intangible costs from the acquisition of avox in october purchased in process research and development our in process research and development ipr d expenses were none in and compared to million in ipr d costs from the acquisition of avox in october were expensed in because they related to technological projects that were in development  had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and for which successful development was uncertain 
litigation costs litigation charges in and were none compared to million in the expenses in were primarily comprised of costs associated with a federal securities law putative class action  and a related shareholder derivative action

 related to domestic income tax positions 
our effective tax rate was a benefit of in compared to a benefit of in the increase in our annual effective tax rate of on a comparative basis was primarily due to a tax expense from our us tax return to provision true up recorded in  as compared to a tax benefit associated with this item in  the sunset of the extraterritorial income exclusion provisions in and reduced benefits from favorable foreign tax rates  all of which were only partially offset by increased tax advantaged income  the absence of any in process research and development write down for as compared to  and lower permanent deductions related to expensing of incentive stock options 
the effective rate benefit associated with the return to provision true up as compared to the tax expense recorded for this item in primarily resulted from increased research and development credit realization in our tax return 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments we consider short term  highly liquid financial instruments that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of days or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
investments classified as short term consist of various financial instruments such as commercial paper  us government agency obligations and corporate notes and bonds with high credit quality with maturities of greater than days when purchased are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as long term consist of our investments in auction rate securities 

table of contents following is a summary of our cash  cash equivalents and investments for the fiscal years ended in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments restricted short term investments long term investments total cash and equivalents and investments we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital requirements and stock repurchase programs for at least the next twelve months 
as of january  we owned approximately million of auction rate securities 
the assets underlying these investments are student loans which are aaa or aa rated  and backed by the us government under the federal family education loan program or private insurers 
historically  these securities have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate periodically every seven to days 
beginning in february of  these auctions began to fail 
although  we have realized higher interest rates for many of these auction rate securities than we would have otherwise  the principal amount will not be accessible until future auctions for these securities are successful  a secondary market is established  or these securities are called for redemption 
therefore  our auction rate securities are classified as long term and are valued at million using significant unobservable inputs 
as a result of these auction failures  these auction rate securities do not have a readily determinable market value 
to estimate their fair values at january   we used a discounted cash flow model based on estimated interest rates  the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  and the credit quality of the underlying securities 
specifically  we estimated the future cash flows over a five year period  and applied a credit default rate to reflect the risk in the marketplace for these investments that has arisen due to the lack of an active market 
as a result of feedback from outside consultants and government activities  including recent settlement agreements  our assumption on the expected recovery period of seven years at september  was modified to five years at january  because of the inherent subjectivity in valuing these securities  we also considered independent valuations obtained for each of our auction rate securities in estimating fair values 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for auction rate securities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs level auction rate securities in thousands balance at december  transfer to level settlements at par unrealized holding loss  included in other comprehensive loss balance at january  we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in fair values does not occur  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or other than temporary impairment charges to the consolidated statement of operation in future periods 
we intend and have the ability to hold these auction rate securities until the market recovers or until maturity 
we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business 
we believe that  based on our current unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable security balances of million at january   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have an impact on our liquidity  our cash flow or our ability to fund our operations 
if the issuers of the auction rate securities are unable to successfully complete future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
it could conceivably take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 

table of contents long term obligation in  we completed the sale of million initial principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due in the senior subordinated convertible notes were issued at an issue price of per note  which is of the principal amount at maturity of the notes 
the senior subordinated convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the principal amount at maturity  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year  from november  until may  holders of the senior subordinated convertible notes may convert their convertible notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes  which represents a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the indenture 
holders have been and are able to convert their convertible notes at any point after the close of business on september  if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter is more than of the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock 
commencing october   this market price conversion feature was satisfied  such that holders of the senior subordinated convertible notes may convert their notes through the final maturity date of the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes  subject to adjustments as provided in the indenture 
if holders elect conversion  we may  at our option  deliver shares of common stock  pay a holder in cash  or deliver a combination of shares and cash  as determined pursuant to the terms of the notes

this amount included net income of million increased by positive non cash adjustments to net income of million primarily comprised of million related to depreciation  million related to amortization  million related to share based compensation expenses  and million of tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options 
these positive cash contributions were partially offset by a decrease of million related to excess tax benefits from stock options exercises and a decrease of million in our net deferred tax liability 
changes in assets and liabilities used additional cash of million primarily due to the increase in receivables and inventory offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash provided by or used in investing activities in  cash provided by investing activities was million  due to the net sales of investments of million  partially offset by million purchases of property  plant and equipment  net of million in transfers of drivers and demonstration equipment from inventory into fixed assets

cash used in acquisitions on february   we entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which we will acquire heartware  subject to customary conditions  including adoption of the merger agreement by heartware s stockholders  the absence of certain legal impediments to consummation of the merger and the expiration or termination of the required waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of the aggregate value of the cash and equity consideration payable by us in the merger is approximately million of which approximately will be paid in cash 
off balance sheet arrangements letter of credit we maintain an irrevocable standby letter of credit as part of our workers compensation insurance program 
the letter of credit is not collateralized 
the letter of credit automatically renews on june th of each year  unless terminated by one of the parties 
at january   our letter of credit balance was approximately  contractual obligations as of january   we had the following contractual obligations total thereafter in millions long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c total a includes interest of million and original issue discount of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k related to our long term debt 
b our operating lease obligations of million were comprised of our various leased facilities and office equipment 
c our purchase obligations include million of supply agreements in effect at january  as of january   the liability for uncertain tax positions was million including interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid

also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the implementation of sfas no 
will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations when we adopt sfas no 
at the beginning of our fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is made up of marketable investments in money market funds  auction rate securities  us treasury securities and debt instruments of government agencies  local municipalities  and high quality corporate issuers 
all investments are carried at market value and are treated as available for sale 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature due to the frequency with which the interest rate is reset and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except government agencies  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
if interest rates were to rise or fall from current levels by basis points  the change in our net unrealized loss on investments would be million 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
our senior subordinated convertible notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued at a fixed rate of interest 
as of january  we owned approximately million of auction rate securities 
the assets underlying these investments are student loans which are aaa or aa rated  and backed by the us government under the federal family education loan program or private insurers 
historically  these securities have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate  periodically every seven to days 
beginning in february of  these auctions began to fail 
although  we have realized higher interest rate for many of these auction rate securities than we would have otherwise  the principal amount will not be accessible until future auctions for these securities are successful  a secondary market is established  or these securities are called for redemption 
therefore  our auction rate securities are classified as long term and are valued at million using significant unobservable inputs 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan

our international operations consist primarily of sales and service personnel for our ventricular assist products who report to our us sales and marketing group and are internally reported as part of that group 
all assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at the period end exchange rates and the resulting translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income

our contracts typically have maturities of three months or less 
our forward foreign currency contracts qualify as derivatives under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instrument and hedging activities and we valued these contracts at the estimated fair value at january  the change in fair value of the forward currency contracts is included in interest income and other  and offsets the foreign currency exchange gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations 
the impacts of these foreign currency contracts are for the fiscal years ended in thousands foreign currency exchange loss on foreign currency contracts foreign currency exchange gain on foreign translation adjustments as of january   we had forward contracts to sell euros with a notional value of million and purchase uk pounds with a notional value of million  and as of december   we had forward contracts to sell euros with a notional value of million and purchase uk pounds with a notional value of million 
as of january   our forward contracts had an average exchange rate of one us dollar to euros and one us dollar to us pounds 
it is highly uncertain how currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million
