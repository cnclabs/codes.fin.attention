item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we provide investment advisory services to institutions and individuals  managing billion in client assets at december  through a variety of investment products designed to suit their investment needs 

table of contents assets under management our operating results fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of our assets under management 
the following table details our assets under management  based on the four types of investment product types we offer in the mutual fund and separate account categories  at december   and in millions mutual funds open end funds closed end funds total mutual funds separate accounts institutional accounts managed accounts total separate accounts total assets under management in order to increase our assets under management and expand our business  we must develop and market investment products that suit the individual investment needs of our target clients investors seeking superior risk adjusted returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our assets under management and our ability to continue to attract clients will depend on a variety of factors  including  among other things purchases and redemptions of shares of the open end funds and other investment products  the amount of non reinvested capital gain distributions  fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of assets under management  the use of leverage within the closed end funds  our ability to educate our target clients about our investment philosophy and provide them with best in class service  the relative investment performance of our investment products as compared to competing offerings and market indices  competitive conditions in the mutual fund  asset management and broader financial services sectors  investor sentiment and confidence  and our introduction of new investment strategies and products and our decision to close strategies when deemed in the best interests of our clients 
investment products mutual funds mutual funds include registered open end funds and registered closed end funds 
open end funds 
open end funds are continually offered and are not listed on an exchange 
open end funds issue new shares for purchase and redeem shares from those shareholders who sell 
the share price for purchases and redemptions of open end funds is determined by each fund s net asset value  which is calculated at the end of each business day 
assets under management in open end funds vary as a result of both market appreciation and depreciation and the level of new purchases or redemptions of shares of a fund 
investment management fees  including performance based fees  are our principal source of revenue from open end mutual funds and are 
table of contents primarily derived from assets under management 
we offer several share classes in each open end fund to provide investors with alternatives to pay for commissions  distribution and service fees 
in  we established calamos global funds plc  also referred to as offshore funds  which is included in open end funds for reporting purposes 
closed end funds 
closed end funds typically sell a finite number of shares to investors through underwritten public offerings 
after the public offerings  investors buy closed end fund shares from  and sell those shares to  other investors through an exchange or broker dealer market 
all of the closed end funds that we manage currently use leverage by issuing preferred securities  as well as more traditional bank financing  which increase their total assets 
assets under management in closed end funds vary due to the amount of assets raised in underwritten public offerings  the amount of leverage utilized and market appreciation or depreciation 
our revenues from closed end funds are derived from the investment management fees on the assets that we manage 
in addition  in a typical underwritten public offering  investors are charged a commission by the selling firms 
we do not receive or pay commissions in connection with sales of closed end fund shares  although we may pay asset based distribution and service fees  as well as one time distribution and service fees to underwriters for underwriting public offerings of closed end funds 
separate accounts separate accounts include institutional accounts and managed accounts for high net worth investors 
fund flows into and out of such accounts  which we refer to as purchases and redemptions  affect our level of assets under management 
assets under management from these accounts also vary as a result of market appreciation and depreciation 
our revenues from separate accounts are derived from investment management fees that we charge  including performance based fees where applicable 
provided below is a brief differentiation of these accounts institutional accounts are separately managed accounts for institutional investors  such as public and private pension funds  public funds  endowment funds and private investment funds  and are offered directly by us through institutional consultants and through national and regional broker dealers 
managed accounts are separately managed accounts for high net worth investors offered primarily through national and regional broker dealers 
revenues our revenues are substantially comprised of investment management fees earned under contracts with the mutual funds and separate accounts managed by us 
the distribution of assets under management among our investment products also will have an impact on our investment management fees  as some products carry different fees than others 
investment management fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value and composition of our assets under management  the amount of non reinvested capital gain distributions  market appreciation or depreciation  the use of leverage within our products  investment performance relative to benchmarks and competitors  level of net purchases and redemptions  which represent the sum of new client assets  additional funding from existing clients  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares  a determination by the independent trustees of the mutual funds to terminate or significantly alter the funds investment management agreements with us  and increased competition 

table of contents our revenues also are comprised of distribution and underwriting fees 
asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  discussed below  are a significant component of distribution and underwriting fees 
distribution and underwriting fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value and composition of our assets under management generally and by share class  market appreciation or depreciation  and the level of purchases and redemptions 
investment management fees investment management fees that we receive from mutual funds for which we act as investment advisor are computed monthly on an average daily net asset value basis 
investment management fees that we earn on separate accounts for which we act as investment advisor are computed quarterly  either in advance or in arrears  based on the assets under management balance at the beginning or end of the quarterly period 
we recognize the revenues derived from these fees over the period during which we render investment advisory services 
distribution and underwriting fees distribution and underwriting fees include asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  front end sales charges and contingent deferred sales charges 
rule b distribution and or service fees are asset based fees that the open end funds pay us over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of rule b of the investment company act 
these fees are typically calculated as a percentage of average daily net assets under management in specific share classes of the open end funds 
these fees fluctuate with both the level of average daily net assets under management and the relative mix of assets among share classes 
rule b fees are generally offset by distribution and service expenses paid during the period  as well as the amortization of deferred sales commissions that were previously paid by us to third parties 
we earn front end sales charges on the sale of class a shares of open end funds  which provide for a sales charge at the time of investment 
we retain a portion of the applicable sales charge and record as revenue only the portion that we retain 
we retain the entire sales charge earned on accounts where calamos financial services acts as the broker dealer 
sales charges are waived on sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum dollar amounts and other specified conditions 
sales charges fluctuate with both the level of class a share sales and the mix of class a shares offered with and without a sales charge 
contingent deferred sales charges are earned on redemptions of class b shares within six years of purchase and on redemptions of class c shares within one year of purchase 
contingent deferred sales charges fluctuate primarily based on the length of the investment in class b and class c shares 
waivers of contingent deferred sales charges apply under certain circumstances 
other revenues other revenues consist primarily of portfolio accounting fees  which are contractual payments calculated as a percentage of combined assets of the mutual funds for financial accounting services  such as expense accruals and tax calculations 
the fees were calculated based on the average daily assets of the open end and closed end funds 
operating expenses our operating expenses  which consist of employee compensation and benefits  distribution and underwriting expenses  amortization of deferred sales commissions  marketing and sales promotion expenses  and general and administrative expenses  fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  incentive compensation  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  
table of contents changes in distribution and underwriting expense as a result of fluctuations in mutual fund sales  level of redemptions and market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management  the amount of rule b distribution and or service fees that we receive  as well as our continued ability to receive those fees in the future  which would affect the amortization expenses associated with the receipt of these fees  changes in the level of our marketing and promotion expenses in response to market conditions  including our efforts to further penetrate our existing distribution channels  and expenses and capital costs  such as technology assets  depreciation  amortization  and research and development  incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure 
we have and will continue to monitor our level of expenses relative to business income and make adjustments as appropriate 
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  incentive compensation  and related benefits costs 
employee compensation and benefits are benchmarked against industry compensation standards 
in order to attract and retain qualified personnel  we must maintain competitive employee compensation and benefits 
in normal circumstances  as we grow  we expect to experience a general rise in employee compensation and benefits expenses over the long term 
we use a fair value method in recording compensation expense for restricted stock units and stock options granted under our incentive stock plan 
under the fair value method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
fair value is determined on the date granted using the black scholes option pricing model for the stock options and is determined by the market value of the underlying stock for restricted stock units 
distribution and underwriting expense distribution and underwriting expense includes payments that we make to broker dealers and other intermediaries for selling  underwriting  servicing and administering mutual funds 
this expense is influenced by new mutual funds sales  levels of redemptions and market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management in these products 
with respect to open end funds  this expense is comprised of rule b distribution and or service fee payments to the selling firms 
amortization of deferred sales commissions as discussed above  we pay commissions to selling firms upon the sale of class b and c shares of open end funds 
as we pay these commissions  we create a deferred sales commission asset on our balance sheet 
we amortize this asset over the period in which we receive related asset based distribution and or service fees pursuant to rule b plans 
amortization expenses generally offset the rule b fees we receive from the funds shareholders over this same period 
in addition  because rule b fees cease upon the redemption of open end fund shares  amortization expenses are accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in a reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include marketing and sales promotion expenses and general and administrative expenses 
marketing and sales promotion expenses generally vary based on the type and level of marketing  educational  sales or other programs in operation and include closed end fund marketing costs and ongoing and one time payments to broker dealers 
in addition  as the open end mutual funds that we manage have grown in size and recognition over time and in normal circumstances  we have become subject to supplemental compensation payments to third party selling agents  which are a component of marketing and sales promotion expense 
we expect supplemental compensation payments to fluctuate with changes in assets under management 
in connection 
table of contents with closed end funds  we make fee payments to certain underwriters for distribution  consulting and or support services rendered during or after the offering period of each closed end fund 
these fees are based on contractual agreements with underwriting firms and are either paid over time based on the average daily net assets of such funds or are paid at the close of the offering period based on the amount of assets raised during the offering 
general and administrative expenses primarily include occupancy related costs  depreciation and professional and business services and generally increase and decrease in relative proportion to the number of employees retained by us and the overall size and scale of our business operations 
impact of distribution and underwriting activities in order to gather assets under management  we engage in distribution and underwriting activities  principally with respect to our family of open end mutual funds 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we present distribution fees earned by us as revenues and distribution fees paid to selling firms and the amortization of deferred sales commissions as expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
however  when analyzing our business  we consider the result of these distribution activities as a net amount of revenue as they are typically a result of a single open end mutual fund share purchase 
hence  the result of presenting this information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is a reduction to our overall operating margin  as the margin on distribution activities is generally lower than the margins on the remainder of our business 
the following table summarizes the net distribution fee margin for the years ended december  and distribution and underwriting fees distribution and underwriting expense amortization of deferred sales commissions net distribution fees net distribution fee margin net distribution fee margin varies by share class because each share class has different distribution and underwriting activities  which are described below 
class a shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  these shares provide for a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
the sales charge is equal to a maximum of of the amount invested 
we retain an underwriting fee representing a portion of this sales charge and pay any remaining amounts to the selling firm 
we retained underwriting fees of million for the year ended december  we receive rule b distribution and service fees on class a shares at a rate of of class a share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
these fees are generally offset by a fee paid to third party selling agents that is recorded as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   we received class a share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class a share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the distribution fee margin that we earn on class a shares is largely driven by the distribution fees that we earn as broker of record and by the portion of front end sales charges that we retain  which fluctuate with both the total class a share sales and the mix of class a share sales with and without a sales charge 
recently  the percentage of class a share sales made without a sales charge has been increasing 
if this trend continues  we expect that our class a share net distribution fee margin will decrease 
class b shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  investors in class b shares do not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we pay an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment is made 
this advanced payment is capitalized as a deferred sales commission asset when paid and is amortized on a straight line basis over eight years 
for the year ended december   we made class b share commission payments to selling firms of million 
if the investor redeems shares within the first six years of investment  we receive a contingent deferred sales charge  often referred to as a cdsc  of between during the first year declining to during the sixth year of the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class b share cdsc payments of million 

table of contents we receive rule b fees on class b shares at the rate of of class b share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make rule b service fee payments to the selling firm at a rate of of class b share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
we retain a distribution fee to help us recover the upfront commissions that we paid to the selling firm 
rule b payments continue for eight years  at which point class b shares automatically convert into class a shares 
for the year ended december   we received class b share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class b share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the net distribution fee margin that we earn on class b shares is primarily the result of the difference between the annual distribution fee revenue that we receive on the average class b share assets under management and the amortization of the upfront commission over the eight year life of the asset 
this differential creates a component of net distribution fee margin unique to class b shares that will remain constant before giving consideration to market appreciation or depreciation 
further  the net distribution fee margin on class b shares fluctuates due to the appreciation or depreciation of the underlying assets 
we expect our distribution fee margin to increase as the underlying class b share assets appreciate and to decrease as these assets depreciate 
class c shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  investors in class c shares do not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we pay an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment is made 
this advanced payment is capitalized as a deferred sales commission asset when paid and is amortized on a straight line basis over months 
for the year ended december   we made commission payments to selling firms of million 
if the investor redeems class c shares within one year of investment  we receive from the proceeds of the sale a cdsc equal to of the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class c share cdsc payments of million 
we receive rule b fees on class c shares at the rate of of class c share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make class c share rule b distribution and service fee payments to the selling firm beginning in the second year following the sale at the rate of of class c share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december  we received class c share b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class c share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the first year s rule b fees help us to recoup the upfront commission we paid to the selling firm  resulting in a net distribution fee margin on class c shares that is generally zero  before giving consideration to market appreciation or depreciation 
however  during the first months following the sale of class c shares  this margin will fluctuate due to the appreciation or depreciation of class c share assets 
appreciation or depreciation of the assets from the time of sale will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the distribution fee revenues 
we expect our distribution fee margin to increase as the underlying class c share assets appreciate and to decrease as these assets depreciate 
class i shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  these shares do not provide for a front end sales charge or rule b fees and are generally offered to individual and institutional investors making initial investments of million or more  therefore  no distribution fee margin exists for this share class 
class r shares were introduced in the first quarter of for purchase through certain tax exempt retirement plans held in plan level or omnibus accounts and represented million of our assets under management as of december  investors in class r shares do not pay a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
we receive rule b fees on class r shares at a rate of of class r share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
these fees are generally offset by a fee paid to third party selling agents that is recorded as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   the class r share b fees that we received and the class r share rule b payments that we made to selling firms were insignificant 

table of contents class x shares were introduced in the fourth quarter of and represented million of our assets under management as of december  these shares do not provide for a front end sales charge or rule b fees and are generally offered to individual and institutional investors making initial investments of million or more  therefore  no distribution fee margin exists for this share class 
currently  these shares are available only through our calamos global funds to foreign investors 
the net distribution fee margin varies by share class so the mix of class a  class b  class c and class r share sales and assets affects the overall net distribution fee margin 
the class a share margin is significantly greater than the class b  class c and class r margins  therefore  we expect that our net distribution fee margin will continue to decline and negatively impact our operating margins 
non operating income loss non operating income loss represents net investment gains or losses from a portion of our investment portfolio and from the limited partnerships that we consolidate  net of minority interest in those partnerships  as well as capital gain distributions  dividends and net interest income or expense 
as we continue to invest a significant portion of our operating cash inflow into investment securities  we expect that the impact of non operating income loss will continue to be significant in future periods

income before minority interest in calamos holdings llc and income taxes includes investment and dividend income earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments held solely by calamos asset management  inc during the same period 
this investment income is not reduced by any minority interest  therefore  the resulting minority interest is less than and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that as we generate and invest cash held solely by calamos asset management  inc the minority interest will continue to decline as a percentage of income before minority interest in calamos holdings llc and income taxes 
minority interest in partnership investments and offshore funds calamos partners llc is the general partner of calamos market neutral opportunities fund lp and was the general partner of calamos equity opportunities fund lp  private investment partnerships

the combined interests of the investments in these partnerships not owned by us are presented as minority interest in partnership investments and offshore funds in our financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  we established calamos global funds plc offshore funds  which is comprised of four ireland based offshore mutual funds 
until december  we owned a majority of the offshore funds and consolidated its results with ours 
however  we no longer own a majority of the offshore funds  and therefore  we no longer consolidate the financial results of the offshore funds into our results 
at december  and  we had and interests in the offshore funds  respectively 
as we launch new products  we as well as our affiliates may invest in these entities  and these products may be required to be consolidated into our results as well 
we expect the consolidation of these new products may be temporary as new customers invest in the products and as our resulting ownership percentage decreases 
income taxes in  developments in the illinois tax statutes resulted in modifications to the company s state tax apportionment methodology that lowered the company s statutory income tax rate from percent to percent 
for the years ended december   and  our effective tax rate not taking into account the one time charge to income resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset to reflect the decrease in our illinois statutory tax rate that occurred in the second quarter of was  and  respectively 
dilutive effect of issuance of new shares of class a common stock when we issue new shares of class a common stock  including upon the exercise or conversion of options or restricted stock units granted pursuant to our incentive compensation plan  our existing class a common stockholders may experience dilution with regard to their indirect ownership interest in the equity of calamos holdings llc 

table of contents operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  assets under management assets under management decreased by billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  average assets under management decreased by billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  at december  and  our assets under management consisted of mutual funds and separate accounts

mutual fund net redemptions were billion in  an unfavorable change of billion from billion of net redemptions in market depreciation was billion in and was billion in appreciation in  and was the primary contributor to the deterioration in assets under management for our open end funds had billion of net redemptions during we believe that the net redemptions were largely due to the global financial market meltdown which led to large  industry wide flight to safety by investors 
net redemptions were affected by million of redemptions by the company used to pre pay debt 
in the fourth quarter of  we re opened our convertible fund for the first time since to take advantage of the broad sell off in the convertible markets that created unprecedented opportunities for long term investors 
immediately following the opening  the convertible fund started generating significant net purchases 
in addition to the convertible fund  we experienced net purchases in a number of our mutual funds  including our total return bond fund and the newly launched equity fund and evolving world growth fund 
market depreciation of billion was the main driver of asset depletion in  while market appreciation of billion helped offset net redemptions in the liquidity crisis in the auction rate securities market during the first quarter of led to the refinancing of the equity securities issued by the closed end funds to leverage those portfolios  with more traditional debt financing 
while the proceeds of those debt financings remain a component of assets under management  certain regulatory and contractual constraints require total assets in closed end funds to be at least three times the amount of 
table of contents debt leverage  which is higher than the asset coverage required when using equity leverage 
the global meltdown that affected security values required us to reduce billion of leverage used by our closed end funds during that we reported as net redemptions 
separate accounts had net redemptions of million in  an improvement of nearly million when compared to billion in net redemptions during we believe that the net redemptions during were primarily due to the significant market decline which occurred in the fourth quarter of separate account net redemptions were also affected by million in redemptions by the company used to pre pay debt in the fourth quarter 
market depreciation of billion in also contributed to the deterioration in assets under management for the period while market appreciation of billion in offset net redemptions 
one time items results of operations for and were significantly impacted by certain one time expenses 
in  developments in the illinois tax statutes resulted in modifications to the company s state tax apportionment methodology that lowered the company s statutory income tax rate from percent to percent 
while we view this to be beneficial for the long term by reducing income taxes  we recorded a one time  non cash income tax expense of million  or per diluted share  in the second quarter of to revalue our net deferred tax assets to reflect the new statutory income tax rate 
the period was impacted by two one time marketing and sales promotion expenses 
during the second quarter of  we incurred a one time expense of million  or cents per diluted share  by terminating our remaining two additional compensation agreements that required us to make recurring payments of approximately million annually based on the assets of calamos convertible opportunities and income fund and calamos strategic total return fund 
additionally  we incurred a million  or cents per diluted share  one time structuring fee related to the launch of the calamos global dynamic income fund chw during the second quarter of we consider results adjusted for these one time expenses  as presented below  to provide a better indication of our operations 
these adjusted items are considered non gaap financial measures as defined by the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
in evaluating operating performance  we consider operating expenses  operating income  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share  each calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  and each item on an as adjusted basis  which constitute non gaap financial measures 
items presented on an as adjusted basis exclude the impact of the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in the second quarter of and the impact of terminating the two closed end fund additional compensation agreements and the chw closed end fund structuring fees in the second quarter of as these one time items are not expected to recur  we believe that excluding these items better enables us to evaluate our operating performance relative to the prior periods 
we consider these non gaap financial measures when evaluating our performance believe the presentation of these amounts provides the reader with information necessary to analyze our operations for the periods compared 
reconciliations of these measurements from the most

the decrease was primarily due to lower investment management fees and distribution and underwriting fees 
change in thousands amount percent investment management fees distribution and underwriting fees other total revenues 
table of contents compared to the prior year  investment management fees decreased in primarily due to a billion decrease in average assets under management across all products 
investment management fees from open end funds decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  primarily due to decreases in open end fund average assets under management of billion for compared to the prior year 
investment management fees from our separately managed accounts decreased to million from million primarily due to an approximate billion decrease in average assets under management 
investment management fees from our closed end funds decreased to million for from million for as a result of a million decrease in closed end fund average assets under management mainly attributable to the deleveraging in the third and fourth quarters of investment management fees  in total  as a percentage of average assets under management were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
distribution and underwriting fees decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in distribution fees as a result of a decrease in open end fund average assets under management and a million decrease cdsc fees  when compared to the prior year 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this change was due to two significant one time marketing and sales promotion charges totaling million that were incurred in the second quarter of and to lower employee compensation and benefits  and distribution and underwriting expenses 
operating expenses  as adjusted  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
change in thousands amount percent employee compensation and benefits distribution and underwriting expense amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total operating expenses during  we initiated a series of cost containment efforts seeking to align the size and costs of our operations with a shrinking asset base  revenues and capital structure 
these efforts began early in with the reduction of associates 
additional efforts have been made to contain costs through staff reductions in november of associates with the reorganization of our information technology function and finally in january with the reduction of more than associates across all aspects of our business  other than our core investment management team 
compensation expenses were not the only focus of our cost cutting initiatives  rather  we have focused on further reducing our cost structure by delaying or canceling information technology projects  reducing capitalized costs  transforming fixed costs to variable by exploring outsourcing alternatives and limiting discretionary spending 
these efforts have continued into  and we expect that our expenses unrelated to our assets under management will continue to decrease from past levels 
employee compensation and benefits expense decreased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year primarily reflecting reductions in performance related expenses  such as incentive compensation and benefit plan contributions 
this decrease also reflects the impact of staff reductions described above to right size the company in response to support reduced asset levels 
distribution and underwriting expense decreased by million for when compared to the prior year  primarily due to an decrease of million resulting from the reduction in the class c share assets older than one year 
this decrease was compounded by a decrease of million in b expenses due to a decrease in average 
table of contents open end fund assets under management 
class c share assets do not generate distribution expense in the first year following their sale because we retain the rule b fees during that first year to offset the upfront commissions that we pay 
however  class c share assets do generate a distribution expense in subsequent years  as we pass along the rule b fees to the selling firms 
although the rule b fee rates we paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries in did not change from the rates paid in the prior year  we expect distribution expense to vary with the change in open end fund assets under management and with the age of the class c share assets 
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased million for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the prior year period  due to a decrease in class c share sales during and to the decrease in the acceleration of amortization associated with class b share redemptions which were lower in marketing and sales promotion expense decreased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  this decrease was mainly due to two one time expenses totaling million in during the second quarter of  we incurred a one time expense of million by terminating our remaining two agreements that required annual payments based on the assets of two closed end funds and a one time million structuring fee in connection with the chw initial public offering 
marketing and sales promotion expenses during were also reduced by lower supplemental distribution payments resulting from the decrease in assets under management 
general and administrative expense increased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period 
occupancy related and depreciation expenses to support our expansion of office facilities  which we contracted for in november  increased by million in when compared to significant reductions in expense were realized in the second half of  a result of our expense control efforts as previously discussed 
for instance  professional services expenses were reduced by more than million 
non operating income loss non operating income loss reduced income by million for the year ended december   compared to adding million of income for the prior year

one time activities results of operations for were significantly impacted by two one time marketing and sales promotion expenses  incurred in the second quarter of  that we believe will benefit our long term financial performance 
first  we incurred a one time expense of million  or cents per diluted share  by terminating our remaining two additional compensation agreements that required us to make recurring payments of approximately million annually based on the assets of calamos convertible opportunities and income fund and calamos strategic total return fund 
when evaluating whether or not to terminate the future payments made under distribution agreements  we compared the net present value of the future cash flows for on going payments to the negotiated one time payments 
we based our decision on the expectation that the termination of the agreements during the second quarter of would result in the reduction of future marketing and sales promotion expenses of approximately  per quarter  or million annually  beginning in the quarter ended september  second  we incurred a million  or cents per diluted share  one time structuring fee related to chw 
our decision to introduce a new closed end fund is generally a function of the receptiveness of the capital markets  our investment strategies and capabilities  and the financial viability of a proposed product 
if a new closed end fund is introduced  we will negotiate with each underwriter the fees and services prior to the public offering 
if any non traditional fees are negotiated  the payments may not extend to each underwriter that participates in the offering  vary among the underwriters receiving such a fee  and differ in form 
structuring fees are upfront non traditional fees paid by us in excess of sales loads or underwriter s commissions 
when structuring fees are paid  we recognize a marketing and sales promotion expense at the time of the offering 
we consider results adjusted for these one time expenses  as presented below  to provide a better indication of the company s operations 
these adjusted items are considered non gaap financial measures as defined by regulation s k of the securities and exchange commission 
in evaluating operating performance  management considers operating expense  operating income and net income  each calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  and each item on an as adjusted basis  which constitute non gaap financial measures 
items presented on an as adjusted basis exclude the impact of terminating the two closed end fund additional compensation agreements and the chw closed end fund structuring fees during the second quarter of as these items are not expected to recur  management believes that excluding these items better enables it to evaluate the company s operating performance relative to the prior periods 
management considers these non gaap financial measures when evaluating the performance of the company and believes the presentation of these amounts provides the reader with information necessary to analyze the company s operations for the periods compared

the overall decline in investment management fees was due to a decrease in fees from open end funds and separately managed accounts  partially offset by higher investment management fees from closed end funds

in addition  employee compensation and benefits expense increased by million for the year ended december  due to the transition payments for two executive officers 
distribution and underwriting expense increased by million for when compared to the prior year  primarily due to an increase of million resulting from the growth in the class c share assets older than one year 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million due to a decrease in average open end fund assets under management 
class c share assets do not generate distribution expense in the first year following their sale because we retain the rule b fees during that first year to offset the upfront commissions that we pay 
however  class c share assets do generate a distribution expense in subsequent years  as we pay the rule b fees to the selling firms 
although the rule b fee rates we paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries in did not change from the rates paid in the prior year  we expect distribution expense to vary with the change in open end fund assets under management and with the age of the class c share assets 
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased million for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the prior year period  due primarily to a decrease in class c share sales during this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the amortization of deferred sales commissions on class b shares due to an increase in redemptions

general and administrative expense increased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period  of which million was attributable to occupancy  depreciation and business services related to supporting additional staff and implementing our new trade order management and portfolio accounting systems to support our new fixed income strategies

liquidity and capital resources despite the unfavorable impact of the economic downturn on our financial results  the company remains highly liquid 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and our corporate investment portfolio  which is comprised of cash and cash equivalents  investment securities  partnership investments and offshore funds  and which makes up a majority of our assets 
we anticipate utilizing our cash and cash equivalent balances to develop and invest in our products as opportunities arise  to invest in property and equipment for our facility and to support our operations

we believe that we were successful in our efforts 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants at december  an indication of our success was received in february when standard poor s affirmed its investment grade bbb negative outlook rating of calamos holdings llc 
we believe that a negative outlook indicates an approximate one in three probability of a rating downgrade in the near term 
we have re opened our convertible products and continue to look for ways to take advantage of the broadly depressed security valuations which we anticipate will add stability to our firm in the short term 
to mitigate the impact of further declines in the valuation of our investment portfolio  during the fourth quarter we initiated a series of hedges specifically a low cost option collar that is comprised of selling short index based call options and purchasing long index based put options 
this hedge provided the stability to our portfolio value as intended

other long term obligations principally represent commitments under equity compensation agreements 
these obligations are included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
deferred sales commissions deferred sales commissions are commissions advanced by us to the selling firm upon sale of class b and class c shares of open end funds 
deferred sales commissions are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which b fees are received 
because b fees cease upon redemption of shares  amortization expense is accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in the reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 
these redemptions result in an amortization period not to exceed months for class c shares and months eight years for class b shares 
we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred sales commissions for impairment on an annual basis 
significant assumptions utilized by us to estimate future average assets under management include expected future market performance and redemption rates 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows and the remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset are made from these assumptions 
market performance assumptions are selected using expected average market returns based on long term market index benchmarks for each asset class held within the fund 
at december   we used average market return assumptions ranging from to based on asset class 
higher actual average market returns would increase undiscounted cash flows  while lower actual average market returns would decrease undiscounted future cash flows 
future redemption assumptions were determined by using the actual redemption rates that each fund experienced over the prior month period 
for class b shares and class c shares  we used average historical redemption rates of and  respectively  at 
table of contents december  an increase in the actual rate of redemptions would decrease the undiscounted future cash flows  while a decrease in the actual rate of redemptions would increase undiscounted cash flows 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually  or when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
if we determine that the deferred sales commission asset is not recoverable  an impairment condition would exist and a loss would be measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the carrying value of the deferred sales commission asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flow  the asset is written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows 
impairment adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of amortization of deferred sales commissions 
as of each reporting period presented  we determined that no impairment of the deferred commission asset existed  but due to the volatility of the capital markets and the changes in redemption rates  we are unable to predict whether or when future impairment of the deferred sales commission asset might occur 
compensation plans we have an incentive stock plan that provides for grants of restricted stock unit awards  or rsus  and stock option awards for certain employees 
rsus are convertible on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock 
we estimate the fair value of the stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model  and recognize the cost of stock based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the award 
further  we estimate the number of forfeited awards at the grant date 
actual forfeitures may vary from our assumptions  which will result in modifications to future expenses 
income taxes management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which principally related to our step up in tax basis to fair market value for our intangible assets under our election to be made under section of the internal revenue code and to our net capital loss carryforward 
in the event that sufficient taxable income of the same character does not result in future years  among other things  a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations  which establishes requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes  measures and discloses identified assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests 
sfas r is effective for us for any business combination with an acquisition date that is on or after january  we have evaluated the impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on our financial statements and concluded it to be immaterial

 which establishes accounting and reporting requirements for noncontrolling interest  which we currently refer to as minority interest 
sfas requires noncontrolling interest to be reported as a component of equity on the consolidated statements of financial position and the amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be identified on the consolidated statements of income 
sfas is effective for us beginning january   after which our presentation of minority interest will change accordingly

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment advisors for the mutual funds and separate accounts we manage 
a significant majority of our operating revenue  approximately for the year ended december   is derived from investment advisory  distribution and portfolio accounting agreements with the mutual funds and separate accounts 
under these agreements  the fees we receive are typically based on the market value of the assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease or by causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk 
in addition  a decline in the prices of securities may present market conditions that could preclude us from increasing assets under management and prevent us from realizing higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the prices of investment securities 
we own investment securities primarily comprised of mutual funds we manage 
at december   the fair value of these 
table of contents investment securities was million 
assuming a increase or decrease in the value of these investments  the fair value would increase or decrease by million at december  additionally  we are subject to market risk due to a decline in the value of our partnership investments  which consist primarily of marketable securities 
as a result  the market values of these partnerships are subject to the same fluctuations as our investment securities 
at december   the fair value of these partnerships was million 
assuming a increase or decrease in the value of these partnerships  the fair value would increase or decrease by million at december  at december   we had an aggregate of million of long term debt outstanding  which consisted of senior unsecured notes of million of notes due april   million of notes due july   million of notes due july  and million of notes due july  as these notes have fixed interest rates  we do not believe that they have any interest rate risk 
due to the nature of our business  we believe that we do not face any material credit risk  inflation  interest rate or foreign currency rate risk
