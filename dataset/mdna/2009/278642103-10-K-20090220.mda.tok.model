intellectual property we regard the protection of our intellectual property as critical to our success 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal  state and common law rights  as well as a variety of administrative procedures 
we actively pursue the registration of our trademarks  copyrights  patents and domain names in the us and international jurisdictions 
the expansion of our business has required us to protect our trademarks  patents and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive  may require litigation  and may not be successful in every location 
we have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the us and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest 
if we are unable to secure our trademarks or domain names  we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain names are not registered 
third parties have from time to time claimed  and others may claim in the future  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we currently are involved in several such legal proceedings

table of contents item a risk factors risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results may decline 
our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our operating results include the following general economic conditions  including the possibility of a severe and protracted recession in the us and worldwide economic slowdown  recent disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the us and worldwide  and those economic conditions specific to the internet  ecommerce and payments industries  our ability to retain an active user base  attract new users  and encourage existing users to list items for sale  purchase items through our websites  or use our payment service or communication software and products  especially when consumer spending is contracting  our ability to reduce the loss of active buyers and sellers and increase activity of the users of our marketplaces business  especially with respect to our top buyers and sellers  and especially in the us  germany and the uk  our ability to successfully integrate and manage businesses that we acquire  including new needs to manage credit risks and bad debts following our acquisition of bill me later in november  our ability to manage funding costs associated with our new bill me later business  the volume  velocity  size  timing  monetization  and completion rates of transactions using our websites or technology  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses  operations  and infrastructure  the primary and second order effects of previously announced and possible future changes to our pricing  products and policies  including  among other changes a reduced emphasis on upfront fees eg  insertion fees for listings and corresponding increases in success based fees eg  final value fees for sold items  new algorithms for determining which listings appear at the top of searches best match  changes to buyer and seller feedback criteria  tighter seller standards  which may restrict some sellers from selling on our websites even if they have been able to do so historically  new restrictions or holds on payments made to certain sellers or in connection with certain categories of higher risk transactions  new incentives and rewards for top powersellers  increased protection for buyers who pay for eligible transactions on ebay 
com using paypal  as well as improved seller protection for us ebay sellers against certain claims  chargebacks and reversals  lower insertion fees for  and extended duration of  listings of fixed price items  shipping and handling limits on certain categories of items eg  media  and requiring sellers to accept at least one accepted payment method and restricting sellers from referencing non permitted payment methods  including paper forms of payment such as checks and money orders  on ebay 
com in the us for most categories of items  regulatory and legal actions imposing obligations on our businesses or our users  including the injunction related to certain cosmetic and perfume brands see item legal proceedings below  new laws or regulations  or interpretations of existing laws or regulations  that impose liability on us for actions of our users or otherwise harm our business models or restrict the internet  electronic commerce  online payments  or online communications  
table of contents our ability to meet regulatory requirements as we expand the range and geographical scope of paypal s services and the range of services and marketing programs offered by skype  the actions of our competitors  including the introduction of new sites  services  and products  consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions using our websites or technology and our ability to manage the costs of our user protection programs  our ability to manage paypal s payment funding mix and the transaction loss rate in our payments business  the costs and results of litigation that involves us  our ability to develop product enhancements  programs  and features at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems  infrastructure  and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth and to improve our websites at a reasonable cost while maintaining operations  technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our websites or services provided to us or our users by third parties  our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose services are required for our operations  such as credit card networks and banks  our ability to manage  profitably expand and effectively monetize the skype business  our ability to manage our businesses following recent reductions in our workforce  the cost and availability of online and traditional advertising  and the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns  our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner and to retain key employees  the continued healthy operation of our technology suppliers and other parties with which we have commercial relations  continued consumer acceptance of the internet as a medium for commerce and communication in the face of increasing publicity about fraud  spoofing  phishing  viruses  spyware  malware and other dangers of the internet  and macroeconomic and geopolitical events affecting commerce generally 
the increased variety of services offered on our websites makes it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
we do not have backlog  and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter 
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues  it is also difficult to forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
we invest heavily in marketing and promotion  customer support  protection programs  technology and further development of the operating infrastructure for our core and non core operations 
some of this investment entails long term contractual commitments 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which may harm our profitability 
growth rates of our marketplaces businesses in our most established markets  such as the us  germany and the us  have continued to decline 
despite our efforts to stem these declines  growth rates in these and other markets may continue to decline 
as our penetration in established markets grows  we will increasingly need to focus on keeping existing users  especially our top buyers and sellers  active and increasing their activity level on our websites in order to continue to grow our business 
in addition  our marketplaces business is facing increased competitive pressure 
if 
table of contents we are unable to change our services in ways that reflect the changing demands of the ecommerce marketplace  particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed price items and higher service levels  our business will suffer 
in january and june  we announced significant changes to our marketplaces business in four major areas fee structure  seller incentives  standards and buyer and seller feedback and increased buyer and seller protections in the us in august  we announced a series of pricing  shipping and other changes for our marketplaces business in our three largest markets the us  germany and the us we may make further changes in these or other areas in the future 
some of the changes that we have announced to date have been controversial with  and led to dissatisfaction among  our sellers  and additional changes that we announce in the future may also be negatively received by a number of our sellers 
given the number of recent changes that we have made to our policies and pricing  it may take a number of our sellers some time to fully assess and adjust to these changes  and sellers may elect to reduce volume while making such assessments and adjustments 
if any of these changes cause sellers to move their business in whole or in part away from our websites or otherwise fail to improve gross merchandise volume or the number of successful listings  our operating results and profitability will be harmed 
in addition  because a large percentage of paypal transactions originate on the ebay platform  declines in growth rates in major marketplaces markets also adversely affect paypal s growth rate 
the expected future growth of our paypal  skype  stubhub  and other lower margin businesses may also cause downward pressure on our profit margins because those businesses have lower gross margins than our marketplaces platforms 
an economic recession could harm our business 
our marketplaces and payments businesses are dependent on consumer purchases 
the current economic downturn has resulted in reduced selling prices and may reduce the volume of purchases on our marketplaces platforms and the volume of transactions paid for using our paypal payment service  and adversely affect our business 
in addition  an economic downturn will likely continue to require us to increase our reserves for bad debt and transaction losses 
continuing poor economic conditions will likely continue these trends 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states but report our results in us dollars  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
in connection with its multi currency service  paypal fixes exchange rates twice per day  and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate or if exposure reports are delayed 
paypal also holds some corporate and customer funds in non us currencies  and thus its financial results are affected by the translation of these non us currencies into non us dollars 
in addition  the results of operations of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues  operating expenses  and net income 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses  and net income will be negatively impacted if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  as happened in the second half of based on changes in foreign currency rates year over year  net revenues in the fiscal year ended december  were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of million  compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  net revenues in the three months ended december  were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of million  compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 
similarly  based on changes in foreign currency rates year over year  operating income for the fiscal year ended december  was positively impacted by foreign currency translation of million  compared to the prior fiscal year  but operating income for the three months ended december  was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of million  compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 
as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
in particular  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro  british pound  australian dollar  or canadian dollar  our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced as a result of these translation adjustments 
while from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure  it is impossible to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure 
in addition  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro  the british pound  the australian dollar  and the canadian dollar  cross border trade related to purchases of dollar denominated goods 
table of contents by non us purchasers will likely decrease  and that decrease will likely not be offset by a corresponding increase in cross border trade involving purchases by us buyers of goods denominated in other currencies  adversely affecting our business 
in addition  we face exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  recent reductions in interest rates have reduced our investment income  including income we earn on paypal balances  which in turn has materially lowered our net interest income 
the listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may harm our business 
we have received in the past  and we anticipate receiving in the future  communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights  trademarks and trade names  or other intellectual property rights 
although we have sought to work actively with the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings offering infringing items on our websites  some rights owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient 
content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have been active in asserting their purported rights against online companies  including ebay 
allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have resulted in threats of litigation and actual litigation against us from time to time by rights owners  including litigation brought by luxury brand owners such as tiffany co 
in the us  rolex us in germany  louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture in france  l or al sa  lanc me parfums et beaut cie  and laboratoire garnier cie in several european countries 
the plaintiffs in these cases seek to hold ebay liable for alleged counterfeit items listed on our sites by third parties  for tester and other not for resale consumer products listed on our sites by third parties  for the alleged misuse of trademarks or copyrights in listings or otherwise on our sites  or in connection with paid search advertisements  or for alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws or parallel import laws for listings of authentic items 
such plaintiffs seek  among other things  injunctive relief and damages 
in the aggregate  these suits could result in significant damage awards and could adversely affect our business 
in june  the paris court of commerce ruled in the louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture cases that ebay and ebay international ag were liable for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit items on its websites that traded on plaintiffs brand names and for interfering with the plaintiffs selective distribution network 
the court awarded the plaintiffs approximately eur million in damages and issued an injunction prohibiting all sales of perfumes and cosmetics bearing the dior  guerlain  givenchy and kenzo brands over all worldwide ebay sites to the extent they are accessible from france 
we have taken measures to comply with the injunction and have appealed these rulings 
however  these and similar suits may force us to modify our business practices  which could lower our revenue  increase our costs or make our websites less convenient to our customers 
any such results could materially harm our business 
in addition to litigation from rights owners  we may be subject to regulatory  civil or criminal proceedings and penalties if the authorities feel we have aided in the sale of counterfeit goods 
while we have had some early success in defending against such litigation  more recent cases have been based  at least in part  on different legal theories than those of earlier cases  and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in defending against such litigation 
for example  the german federal supreme court has ruled that we may owe duties  under certain circumstances  to content owners and competitors relating to taking reasonable steps to prevent the listing of illegal  counterfeit  and pirated items 
plaintiffs in recent cases have argued that we are not entitled to safe harbors under the digital millennium copyright act in the us or as a hosting provider in the european union because of the alleged active nature of our involvement with our sellers  and that  whether or not such safe harbors are available  we should be found liable because we supposedly have not adequately removed counterfeit listings or effectively suspended users who have created such listings 
we are constantly improving and modifying our efforts to eliminate counterfeit and pirated items 
these improvements are in response to ongoing business initiatives designed to reduce bad buyer experiences and improve customer satisfaction as well as in response to new patterns we are seeing among counterfeiters and others committing fraud on our users 
notwithstanding these efforts  we believe that the legal climate  especially in europe  is becoming more adverse to our arguments  which may require us to take actions which could lower our revenues  increase our costs  or make our websites less convenient to our customers  which may materially harm our business 
in addition  a public perception that counterfeit or pirated items are commonplace on our site  even if factually incorrect  could damage our reputation and our business 

table of contents content owners and other intellectual property rights owners may also seek to bring legal action against entities that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items  such as payment companies 
to the extent that intellectual property rights owners bring legal action against paypal based upon the use of paypal s payment services in a transaction involving the sale of infringing items  including on our websites  our business could be harmed 
we are subject to patent litigation 
we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties patents 
some of these ongoing suits are described under the heading item legal proceedings  below 
we are a defendant in other patent suits and we have been notified of several other potential patent disputes  and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces  payments and communications businesses as our services expand in scope and complexity 
these claims  whether meritorious or not  are time consuming and costly to resolve  and could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business  could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements  or could require us to cease conducting certain operations 
use of our services for illegal purposes could harm our business 
the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users on their service is often challenged in the us and internationally 
in violation of our policies  unlawful goods and stolen goods have been listed and traded on our services 
we may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful or stolen goods or unlawful services or selling goods or services in an unlawful manner  and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our services 
we have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations 
in december  an executive of baazee 
com  our indian subsidiary  was arrested in connection with a user s listing of a pornographic video clip on that website 
we continue to contest the charges related to this arrest 
similarly  our korean subsidiary and one of its employees were found criminally liable for listings on the korean subsidiary s website 
the german federal supreme court has ruled that we may have a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent prohibited dvds from being sold on our site to minors and that competitors may be able to enforce this duty 
in a number of circumstances  third parties have alleged that our services aid and abet certain violations of certain laws  including antiscalping laws with respect to the resale of tickets  laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items  the fencing of stolen goods  and restrictive distribution laws and distance selling laws 
although we have prohibited the listing of stolen goods and certain high risk items and implemented other protective measures  we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings  any of which could harm our business 
any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the alleged or actual sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods could harm our business 
in addition  we have received significant and continuing media attention relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods and stolen goods using our services 
this negative publicity  even if factually incorrect  could damage our reputation  diminish the value of our brand names and make users reluctant to use our services 
paypal s payment system is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these may include illegal online gambling  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  piracy of software and other intellectual property  money laundering  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products  and online securities fraud 
recent changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities 
despite measures paypal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct  including paypal s ability to take legal action to recover its losses for certain violations of its acceptable use policy  illegal activities could still be funded using paypal 
any resulting claims or liabilities could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is often unsettled 
claims could be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or 
table of contents other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability under a number of these theories have been brought against us  as well as other online service companies 
in addition  domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
our service features a feedback forum  which includes information from users regarding other users 
although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us  claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for not removing content posted in the feedback forum 
furthermore  several court decisions arguably have narrowed the scope of the immunity provided to internet service providers like us under the communications decency act 
for example  the ninth circuit recently held that certain immunity provisions under the communications decency act might not apply to the extent that a website owner materially contributes to the development of unlawful content on its website 
in addition  the paris court of commerce has ruled in the louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture cases that applicable laws protecting passive internet hosts from liability are inapplicable to ebay given that the content in question was provided by users under ebay s control and authority 
this trend  if continued  may increase our potential liability to third parties for the user provided content on our sites  particularly in jurisdictions outside the us where laws governing internet transactions are unsettled 
if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate  we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability  including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings  which would negatively affect our financial results 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation and our business 
government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties 
a large number of transactions occur on our websites on a daily basis 
government regulators have received a significant number of consumer complaints about both ebay and paypal  which  while small as a percentage of our total transactions  are large in aggregate numbers 
as a result  from time to time we have been contacted by various foreign and domestic governmental regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and the steps we take to protect our users from fraud 
paypal has received inquiries regarding its restriction and disclosure practices from the federal trade commission and regarding these and other business practices from the attorneys general of a number of states 
in september  paypal entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of a number of states under which it agreed to pay million to the attorneys general  shorten and streamline its user agreement  increase educational messaging to users about funding choices  and communicate more information regarding protection programs to users 
we currently face inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to actions that we have taken that are designed to improve the safety of transactions on our websites  most notably by requiring paypal to be offered and or used for certain high risk transactions or by certain sellers in certain jurisdictions  and we may face similar inquires from other government regulators in the future 
for example  the reserve bank of australia is currently reviewing our policy requiring sellers to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized australian website and precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting paypal as a payment method 
similarly  bill me later has from time to time received customer complaints that could result in investigations into bill me later s business practices by state or federal regulators 
as a result of the current credit crisis  we expect new laws and regulations to be imposed on providers of credit 
we are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future  including under existing or new credit laws or regulations  which may lead to action against us 
we have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts  customer support procedures  operating procedures and disclosures 
if one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries  we could be subject to enforcement actions  fines or other penalties  or forced to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business 
we are subject to general litigation and regulatory disputes 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our business expands and 
table of contents our company grows larger 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act  the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable 
any claims or regulatory actions against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming result in costly litigation  damage awards  injunctive relief  or increased costs of business through adverse judgment or settlement  require us to change our business practices in expensive ways  require significant amounts of management time  result in the diversion of significant operational resources  or otherwise harm our business 
failure to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions and customer disputes would increase our loss rate and harm our business 
beginning in october  buyers who pay for transactions on ebay 
com with paypal are protected on eligible transactions for the full amount of an item s purchase price if the buyer does not receive the goods they purchased or if the goods differ significantly from what was described by the seller 
furthermore  us sellers on ebay 
com have received improved seller protection for eligible transactions in which the seller is paid with paypal  in that they are covered against payment reversals due to buyer claims of an unauthorized payment or an item that was not received  so long as the seller follows specified shipping and handling practices 
we also enhanced our buyer and seller protections in certain ebay international marketplaces 
these changes to paypal s buyer protection program could result in future increases and fluctuations in our payments transaction loss rate 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   our payments transaction losses including both direct losses and buyer protection payouts totaled million and million  representing and of our net total payment volume in each period  respectively 
paypal s highly automated and liquid payment service makes paypal an attractive target for fraud 
in configuring its service  paypal continually strives to maintain the right balance of appropriate measures to promote both convenience and security for customers 
identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as paypal 
we believe that several of paypal s current and former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud 
while paypal uses advanced anti fraud technologies  we expect that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent paypal s anti fraud systems using increasingly sophisticated methods 
in addition  paypal s service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches  and paypal may be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches 
merchants could also request reimbursement  or stop using paypal  if they are affected by buyer fraud 
paypal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud  including claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant s description 
paypal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase  from buyer fraud  from erroneous transmissions  and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments 
in addition to the direct costs of such losses  if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive  they could result in paypal losing the right to accept credit cards for payment 
if paypal were unable to accept credit cards  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease and result in corresponding decreases in our net total payment volume  in which case our business would further suffer 
bill me later is similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants  users of the bill me later service and third parties handling its user information  which could increase our exposure to transaction losses and reduce the profitability of bill me later s business 
our payments business has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud  but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings 
if these measures do not succeed  our business will suffer 
ebay faces similar risks with respect to fraudulent activities on its websites 
ebay periodically receives complaints from users who may not have received the goods that they had purchased 
in some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites 
ebay also receives complaints from sellers who have not received payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase 
non payment may occur 
table of contents because of miscommunication  because a buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the contract to purchase the item  or because the buyer bid on the item maliciously in order to harm either the seller or ebay 
in some european and asian jurisdictions  buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period 
while sometimes ebay can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users  ebay does not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods  or otherwise make users whole other than through our limited buyer protection programs 
other than through these programs  ebay does not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users  although users who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their credit card company or bank  which in turn will seek reimbursement from paypal 
ebay also periodically receives complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
we expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made 
our liability for these sort of claims is only beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non us jurisdictions than it is in the us litigation involving liability for third party actions could be costly for us  divert management attention  result in increased costs of doing business  lead to adverse judgments  or otherwise harm our business 
in addition  affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us  including imposing fines or seeking injunctions 
negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our marketplaces and payments services could damage our reputation  reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users  diminish the value of our brand names 
we believe that negative user experiences are one of the primary reasons users stop using our services 
any factors which reduce cross border trade could harm our business 
cross border transactions using our websites generally provide higher revenues and gross margins than similar transactions that take place within a single country due to higher transaction fees we earn for those transactions 
cross border trade has become an increasingly important source of both revenue and profits for us 
to the extent that any factors result in a net reduction in cross border trade  including  among other factors  fluctuations in exchange rates  the application of specific national or regional laws eg  selective distribution channel laws to users in other countries  or any other factors impose restrictions on  or increase the costs of  shipping goods across national borders  our business would suffer 
we believe that recent increases in the relative value of the us dollar versus other currencies have reduced cross border trade between us sellers and foreign buyers  without a corresponding increase in cross border traffic in the other direction  adversely affecting our business 
our business is subject to online security risks  including security breaches and identity theft 
to succeed  online commerce and communications must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
our security measures may not detect or prevent security breaches that could harm our business 
currently  a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us 
paypal s users routinely provide credit card and other financial information 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information  including customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect transaction data 
in addition  any party who is able to illicitly obtain a user s password could access the user s transaction data 
an increasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security 
any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and  therefore  our business  and could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws 
in addition  a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information  cause interruption in our operations  damage our computers or those of our users  or otherwise damage our reputation and business 
under credit card rules and our contracts with our card processors  if there is a breach of credit card information that we store  or that is stored by paypal s direct credit card processing customers  we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses 
in addition  if we fail to follow credit card industry security standards  even if there is no compromise of customer information  we could incur significant 
table of contents fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments or pay their fees 
if we were unable to accept credit cards  our business would be seriously damaged 
ebay s korean subsidiary  iac  has notified a majority of its approximately million users of a data breach involving personally identifiable information including name  address  resident registration number and some transaction and refund data but not including credit card information or real time banking information 
approximately  users have sued iac over this breach in several lawsuits and we expect more to do so in the future 
there is some precedent in korea for a court to grant consolation money for data breaches without a specific finding of harm from the breach 
such precedents have involved payments of up to approximately per user 
a consumer agency recently made a non binding recommendation that iac make payments of  korean won approximately to consumers who had complained to it as a result of such breach 
iac intends to vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit 
our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins  and similar disruptions  and we have experienced denial of service type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time 
we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches 
these issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate 
security breaches  including any breach by us or by parties with which we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of our users personal information  could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies carry low coverage limits  which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
our users  as well as those of other prominent internet companies  have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate passwords  credit card numbers  or other personal information or to introduce viruses through trojan horse programs to our users computers 
these emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by ebay  paypal  skype  or a user of one of those businesses  but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program 
despite our efforts to mitigate spoof and phishing emails through product improvements and user education  spoof and phishing remain a serious problem that may damage our brands  discourage use of our websites  and increase our costs 
changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to laws relating to the collection  use  retention  security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users  especially for financial information and for users located outside of the us in many cases  these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also to transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries  and between ourselves  our subsidiaries  and other parties with which we have commercial relations 
new laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions  and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions 
the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux 
these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications 
complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 
in addition  we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection  use and disclosure of user data 
any failure  or perceived failure  by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal  state or international privacy or consumer protection related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others  subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us 
in addition  as noted above  we are subject to the possibility of security breaches  which themselves may result in a violation of these laws 
our revenue from advertising is subject to factors beyond our control 
we derive an increasing portion of our revenues from advertising on our websites 
revenues from online advertising are sensitive to events and trends that affect advertising expenditures  such as general changes in the 
table of contents economy and changes in consumer spending  as well as the effectiveness of online advertising versus offline advertising media and the value our websites provide to advertisers relative to other websites 
in addition  major search engine operators have the ability to change from time to time  at their sole discretion  the rules and search algorithms governing the pricing  availability  and placement of online advertising 
any changes in these rules or search algorithms could materially reduce the value that we derive from online advertising on our websites  either directly or indirectly 
for example  retailers pay a fee to shopping 
com for online shoppers directed to their websites by shopping 
com 
rule changes made by search engines in disrupted traffic to our shopping 
com website  which in turn has adversely affected click through traffic to retailers from our shopping 
com website and associated fee revenue 
if we experience a reduction in our advertising revenues due to economic  competitive  technological or other factors  including a reduction in consumer spending due to the current recession in the us and worldwide economic slowdown or if we are unable to provide value to our advertisers  our business and financial results would suffer 
our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands  and these efforts may be costly 
we believe that continuing to strengthen our brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services  and will require a continued focus on active marketing efforts across all of our brands 
the demand for and cost of online and traditional advertising have been increasing  and may continue to increase 
accordingly  we will need to continue to spend substantial amounts of money on  and devote substantial resources to  advertising  marketing  and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users 
since  we have significantly increased the number of brands we are supporting  adding rent 
com  shopping 
com  our classified websites eg  kijiji and marktplaats  stubhub  skype and bill me later  among others 
each of these brands requires its own resources  increasing the costs of our branding efforts 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues  and even if they do  any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brands 
also  major search engine operators that we use to advertise our brands have frequently changing rules that govern their pricing  availability and placement of online advertisement eg  paid search  keywords  and changes to these rules could negatively affect our use of online advertising to promote our brands 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brands  or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands  our business would be harmed 
new and existing regulations could harm our business 
we are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other companies conducting business on and off the internet 
it is not always clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property issues  parallel imports and distribution controls  taxation  libel and defamation  obscenity  and personal privacy apply to online businesses such as ours 
the majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
those laws that do reference the internet  such as the us digital millennium copyright act and the european union s directive on distance selling and electronic commerce  are being interpreted by the courts  but their applicability and scope remain uncertain 
furthermore  as our activities and the types of goods and services listed on our websites expand  including through acquisitions such as our acquisition of bill me later  a transactional credit provider  in november and stubhub  an online ticket marketplace  in february  regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction  either generally or with respect to certain actions eg  the sale of real estate  event tickets  cultural goods  boats and automobiles 
our success and increased visibility has driven some existing businesses that perceive our business model to be a threat to their business to raise concerns about our business models to policymakers and regulators  particularly in the us and europe 
these established businesses and their trade association groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations 
they may employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the ability of users to use our products and services 
in particular  these established businesses have raised concerns relating to pricing  parallel imports  professional seller obligations  stolen goods  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights  and the liability of the provider of an 
table of contents internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related to those and other issues 
success in changing the legal or regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for third party listings could negatively impact our business 
over the last few years some large retailers and their trade associations have sought legislation in a number of states and the us congress that would make ebay liable for the sale of stolen property or would ban certain categories of goods from sale on our platform  including gift cards and health and beauty products 
no such legislation has passed 
nonetheless  the proponents continue to seek passage of such legislation  and if any of these laws are adopted it could harm our business 
numerous states and foreign jurisdictions  including the state of california  where our headquarters are located  have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers 
several states and some foreign jurisdictions  including france  have attempted  and may attempt in the future  to impose such regulations upon us or our users 
attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing and such attempted enforcements could harm our business 
in france  we have been sued by conseil des ventes  the french auction regulatory authority 
the agency alleges that sales on our french website constitute illegal auctions that cannot be performed without its consent 
a lawsuit alleging similar claims has been brought against us by two associations of french antique dealers 
we intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits 
however  this and other regulatory and licensure claims could result in costly litigation and  if successful  could require us to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues for example  by forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items for some locations 
we could also be subject to fines or other penalties  and any of these outcomes could harm our business 
a number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our websites subject to unfavorable local laws 
for example  trademark exhaustion principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has been placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holder s consent 
the application of trademark exhaustion principles is largely unsettled in the context of the internet  and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations  our business could be harmed 
as we expand and localize our international activities  we become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide  and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide  one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users  or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction 
for example  we were found liable in france  under french law in the recent louis vuitton malletier litigation for transactions on our websites worldwide that did not involve french buyers and sellers 
laws regulating internet and ecommerce companies outside of the us may be less favorable than those in the us  giving greater rights to consumers  content owners  competitors  users and other third parties 
compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings  and the imposition of any regulations on our users may harm our business 
in addition  we may be subject to overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us 
our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services 
if our payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations  including those governing money transmission  electronic funds transfers  money laundering  banking and lending  it could be subject to liability  licensure and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business practices 
to date  paypal has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in us states and territories and interpretations in seven states that licensing is not required under their existing statutes 
the remaining us states and territories do not currently regulate money transmitters 
as a licensed money transmitter  paypal is subject to restrictions on its investment of customer funds  reporting requirements  bonding requirements  and inspection by state regulatory agencies 
if paypal were found to be in violation of money services laws or regulations  paypal could be subject to liability  forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states  forced to change its business practices  or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial 
table of contents cost on paypal 
any change to paypal s business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on ebay  which would further harm our business 
although there have been no definitive interpretations to date  paypal has assumed that its service is subject to the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e of the federal reserve board 
as a result  among other things  paypal must provide advance disclosure of changes to its service  follow specified error resolution procedures and reimburse consumers for losses above from transactions not authorized by the consumer 
paypal currently voluntarily reimburses consumers for all financial losses from transactions not authorized by the consumer  not just losses above paypal seeks to pass most of these losses on to the relevant merchants  but paypal incurs losses if the merchant does not have sufficient funds in its paypal account 
paypal is also subject to anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations that prohibit  among other things  its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities 
although paypal has adopted a program to comply with these laws and regulations  any errors or failure to implement the program properly could lead to lawsuits  administrative action  and prosecution by the government 
paypal is also subject to regulations that require it to report suspicious activities involving transactions of  or more and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of  or more 
the interpretation of suspicious activities in this context is uncertain 
future regulations under the usa patriot act may require paypal to revise the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor international transactions more closely 
as paypal localizes its service in other countries  additional verification and reporting requirements may apply  which in some cases are more stringent 
several countries  including australia  canada  luxembourg and singapore  have implemented or are in the process of implementing new anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations  and the impact of these laws and regulations on paypal s business is uncertain 
paypal could be required  among other things  to learn more about its customers before opening an account  to obtain additional verification of customers and to monitor its customers activities more closely 
these requirements could impose significant costs on paypal  make it more difficult for new customers to join its network and reduce the attractiveness of its product 
failure to comply with federal  state or foreign money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits  penalties  and forfeiture of significant assets 
while paypal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from markets  only of those markets including the us allow its customers to receive payments  in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds 
these limitations may affect paypal s ability to grow in these markets 
of the markets whose residents can use the paypal service  countries plus four french overseas departments are members of the european union eu 
since  paypal has provided localized versions of its service to customers in the eu through paypal europe sarl et cie  sca  a wholly owned subsidiary of paypal that is licensed as a bank in luxembourg 
accordingly  paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure  reporting  anti money laundering  capitalization  funds management  corporate governance or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks 
paypal has limited experience in operating as a bank  and any fines or other enforcement actions imposed by the luxembourg regulator could adversely affect paypal s business 
paypal europe implements its localized services in eu countries through an expedited passport notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other eu member states pursuant to eu directives  and has completed the passport notice process in all eu member countries 
the regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that will apply to its business  in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law  and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office 
any such responses from these regulators could increase the cost of  or delay  paypal s plans for expanding its business 
in markets other than the us  eu  australia and china  paypal serves its customers through paypal private ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of paypal that is based in singapore 
in many of these markets  it is not clear whether paypal s singapore based service is subject to singaporean law or  if it is subject to local laws  whether 
table of contents such local law requires a payment processor like paypal to be licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise 
even if paypal is not currently required to obtain a license in some jurisdictions  future localization or targeted marketing of paypal s service in those countries  or expansion of the financial products offered by paypal to new jurisdictions either alone  through a commercial alliance or through an acquisition  could subject paypal to additional licensure requirements  laws and regulations and increased regulatory scrutiny 
these factors could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of its products 
delay or failure to receive such a license or regulatory approval could require paypal to change its business practices or features in ways that would adversely affect paypal s international expansion plans and could require paypal to suspend providing products and services to customers in one or more countries 
our bill me later service is similarly subject to a variety of laws and regulations 
although bill me later does not originate loans  one or more jurisdictions may conclude that bill me later is a lender or money transmitter or loan broker  which could subject us to liability or regulation in one or more jurisdictions 
additionally  federal regulators could mandate changes to the relationship between bill me later and cit bank  the financial institution that bill me later relies on to extend credit to customers with the bill me later service 
any adverse changes in this relationship could negatively impact bill me later s ability to continue operating its business as currently conducted 
changes to credit card networks or bank fees  rules  or practices could harm paypal s business 
paypal does not belong to or directly access credit card networks  such as visa and mastercard 
as a result  paypal must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions  and must pay a fee for this service 
from time to time  credit card networks have increased  and may increase in the future  the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards 
paypal s credit card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to paypal as well as increase their own fees for processing 
these increased fees increase paypal s operating costs and reduce its profit margins 
paypal is also required by its processors to comply with credit card network operating rules  and paypal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by credit card networks as a result of any rule violations by paypal or paypal s customers 
the credit card networks set and interpret the credit card rules 
credit card networks could adopt new operating rules or re interpret existing rules that paypal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow 
as a result  paypal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments 
if paypal were unable to accept credit cards  its business would be seriously damaged 
in addition  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease and our business would further suffer 
paypal is required to comply with credit card networks special operating rules for internet payment services 
paypal and its credit card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchant customers in order to comply with these rules  but any failure to comply could result in fines  the amount of which would be within the credit card networks discretion 
paypal also could be subject to fines from credit card networks if it fails to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered high risk  primarily the sale of certain types of digital content 
for high risk merchants  paypal must either prevent such merchants from using paypal or register such merchants with credit card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants 
paypal has incurred fines from its credit card processor relating to paypal s failure to detect the use of its service by high risk merchants 
the amount of these fines has not been material  but any additional fines in the future would likely be for larger amounts  could become material  and could result in a termination of paypal s ability to accept credit cards or changes in paypal s process for registering new customers  which would seriously damage paypal s business 
changes in paypal s funding mix could adversely affect paypal s results 
paypal pays significant transaction fees when senders fund payment transactions using credit cards  nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts  and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance or use buyer credit issued by ge money bank 
senders fund a significant portion of paypal s payment volume using credit cards  and paypal s financial success will remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards 
senders may prefer funding using credit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons  
table of contents including the ability to dispute and reverse charges directly with their credit card provider if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described  the ability to earn frequent flier miles or other incentives offered by credit card issuers  the ability to defer payment  or a reluctance to provide bank account information to paypal 
the proportion of paypal s payment volume funded using credit cards has increased over time 
in addition  some of paypal s newer offerings  including the ability to make a limited number of payments without opening an account  have a higher rate of credit card funding than paypal s basic product offering 
in september  paypal entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of a number of states under which it agreed to pay million to the attorneys general  shorten and streamline its user agreement  and communicate more information regarding protection programs to users 
also in september  paypal announced that it had reached a preliminary settlement agreement under which it agreed to pay approximately million into a settlement fund for the benefit of a class represented by plaintiffs in a suit that alleged  among other things  that paypal s disclosure regarding the effects of users choice of funding mechanism was deceptive 
this settlement has now been approved by the court 
although paypal did not admit any liability for any of the allegations in the two cases  changes to our disclosure practices could result in increased use of credit card funding  which could harm paypal s business 
paypal s failure to manage customer funds properly would harm its business 
paypal s ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls 
in some of the markets that paypal serves and currencies that paypal offers  paypal has a limited operating history and limited management experience in managing these internal controls 
as paypal s business continues to grow  it must strengthen its internal controls accordingly 
paypal s success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds 
any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage accurately customer funds could diminish customer use of paypal s product severely 
system failures could harm our business 
we have experienced system failures from time to time  and any interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our current revenues and profits  could harm our future revenues and profits  and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
our ebay 
com website has been interrupted for periods of up to hours  and our paypal website has suffered intermittent unavailability for periods as long as five days 
in august  skype experienced an interruption during which the majority of skype s users were unable to use its products for approximately two days 
any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate  and possibly substantial  loss of revenues 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable  leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites  and could permanently harm our reputation and brands 
reliability is particularly critical for paypal  especially as it seeks to expand its merchant services business 
because paypal is a regulated financial entity  frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to fines  penalties  or mandatory changes to paypal s business practices  and ultimately could cause paypal to lose existing licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that it needs to expand 
finally  because our customers may use our products for critical transactions  any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  this type of claim likely would be time consuming and costly for us to address 
although our systems have been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks  and similar events 
some of our systems  including our shopping 
com and skype websites and the systems related to the bill me later business  are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities 
our systems are also subject to break ins  sabotage  and intentional acts of vandalism 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster  a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons  or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 

table of contents there are many risks associated with our international operations 
our international expansion has been rapid and our international business  especially in germany and the uk  has also become critical to our revenues and profits 
net revenues outside the us accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues in fiscal years and expansion into international markets requires management attention and resources and requires us to localize our services to conform to local cultures  standards  and policies 
the commercial  internet  and transportation infrastructure in lesser developed countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our traditional marketplace business model 
in many countries  we compete with local companies that understand the local market better than we do  and we may not benefit from first to market advantages 
we may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations 
for example  in we withdrew our ebay marketplace offering from the japanese market  and in we contributed our business in china to a joint venture with a local chinese company 
even if we are successful in developing new markets  we often expect the costs of operating new sites to exceed our net revenues for at least months in most countries 
as we continue to expand internationally  including through the expansion of paypal  skype  shopping 
com  and our classified businesses  we are increasingly subject to risks of doing business internationally  including the following strong local competitors  regulatory requirements  including regulation of internet services  communications  auctioneering  professional selling  distance selling  privacy and data protection  banking  and money transmitting  that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in some jurisdictions  prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers  prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods  require product changes  require special licensure  subject us to various taxes  penalties or audits  or limit the transfer of information between us and our affiliates  greater liability or legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings and other content provided by our users  including uncertainty as a result of legal systems that are less developed with respect to the internet  unique local laws  conflicting court decisions and lack of clear precedent or applicable law  cultural ambivalence towards  or non acceptance of  online trading  laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses  difficulties in integrating with local payment providers  including banks  credit and debit card networks  and electronic fund transfer systems or with the local telecommunications infrastructure  differing levels of retail distribution  shipping  communications  and internet infrastructures  different employee employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  challenges associated with joint venture relationships  including dependence on our joint venture partners  difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices  and greater problems in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse tax consequences  including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites  higher telecommunications and internet service provider costs  different and more stringent user protection  data protection  privacy and other laws  seasonal reductions in business activity  expenses associated with localizing our products  including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency  
table of contents profit repatriation restrictions  foreign currency exchange restrictions  and exchange rate fluctuations  volatility in a specific country s or region s political  economic or military conditions  and differing intellectual property laws 
some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs 
as we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  repatriating money without adverse tax consequences  and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is discussed in more detail under we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates  above 
in addition  we conduct certain functions  including product development  customer support and other operations  in regions outside the us  particularly in india and china 
we are subject to both us and local laws and regulations applicable to our offshore activities  and any factors which reduce the anticipated benefits  including cost efficiencies and productivity improvements  associated with providing these functions outside of the us could adversely affect our business 
we are continuing to expand paypal s services internationally 
in some countries  expansion of paypal s business may require a close commercial relationship with one or more local banks  a shared ownership interest with a local entity or registration as a bank under local law 
such requirements may reduce our profitability or limit the scope of our activities in particular countries 
any limitation on our ability to expand paypal internationally could harm our business 
we maintain a portion of shopping 
com s research and development facilities and personnel in israel  and in january we acquired fraud sciences ltd  an israeli company 
as a result  political  economic and military conditions in israel affect those operations 
the future of peace efforts between israel and its neighboring countries remains uncertain 
increased hostilities or terrorism within israel or armed hostilities between israel and neighboring states could make it more difficult for us to continue our operations in israel  which could increase our costs 
in addition  many of our employees in israel could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time under emergency circumstances 
our israeli operations could be disrupted by the absence of employees due to military service  which could adversely affect our business 
acquisitions and joint ventures could result in operating difficulties  dilution  and other harmful consequences 
we have acquired a number of businesses in the past  including  most recently  bill me later  inc in the united states and den bl avis and bilbasen  classified businesses in denmark 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  technologies  services  products and other assets 
at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions 
any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
the process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time  as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration  particularly given the large number and size and varying scope of our recent acquisitions  declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in  or acceleration of  compensation  or changes in management  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management  information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  
table of contents the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls  procedures and policies  in the case of foreign acquisitions  the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic  currency  political  and regulatory risks associated with specific countries  in some cases  the need to transition operations  users  and customers onto our existing platforms  and liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition  including violations of laws  rules and regulations  commercial disputes  tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions  or may not realize them in the time frame expected 
for example  in connection with the skype transaction  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately billion in our financial statements during future acquisitions or mergers may require us to issue additional equity securities  spend our cash  or incur debt  liabilities  amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write offs of goodwill  any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 
in addition  we have made certain investments  including through joint ventures  in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control 
these investments may involve risks 
for example  the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests  strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours  and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture 
bill me later will expose us to new risks 
we acquired bill me later  a company that provides transaction based credit  in late upon acquiring bill me later  we became exposed to new risks 
bill me later is not a chartered financial institution  and relies on cit bank to extend credit to bill me later customers in order to offer the bill me later service 
when a consumer makes a purchase using the bill me later service  cit bank funds the consumer loan at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant  and bill me later subsequently purchases the receivable related to the consumer loan extended by cit bank 
although cit bank continues to own each customer account  bill me later owns the related receivable and is responsible for all servicing functions related to the account 
any termination or interruption of cit bank s services to us  including due to the suspension or termination of cit bank s banking charter  a regulatory challenge to the relationship between cit bank and bill me later or the termination of our commercial relationship with cit bank for any reason  could materially and adversely affect our ability to offer the bill me later service 
under those circumstances  we would likely be required to either reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all  or to obtain our own bank charter  which would be a time consuming and costly process and would subject us to a number of additional laws and regulations 
bill me later also relies on third party merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions using the bill me later service 
most of the transaction volume by dollar amount through the bill me later service is currently settled through the facilities of a single vendor 
any disruption to our payment processing and gateway services would adversely affect the bill me later service 
we currently fund the origination of receivables related to bill me later accounts through free cash flow generated from our portfolio of businesses and from our existing line of credit 
as a result of the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc  our available line of credit was effectively reduced by lehman brothers commercial bank s million commitment 
if other financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by us and global economic conditions  they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us 
our ability to securitize receivables related to bill me later accounts is dependent upon  among other things  conditions in the structured finance markets  which have been subject to recent disruptions in the credit industry  resulting in very limited liquidity for securitization purposes 
if 
table of contents we are unable to fund receivables related to the bill me later business in a cost effective manner  the growth and profitability of the bill me later business could be significantly and adversely affected 
the bill me later service is offered to a wide range of consumers  and the profitability of this business depends on our ability to manage credit risk while attracting new consumers with profitable usage patterns 
bill me later approves loans using proprietary segmentation and credit scoring algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of the specific transaction 
these algorithms and techniques may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer due to  among other factors  inaccurate assumptions about a particular consumer or the economic environment 
bill me later may also incorrectly interpret the data produced by these algorithms in setting its credit policies 
bill me later s ability to manage credit risk may also be adversely affected by economic conditions  legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations  competitors actions and consumer behavior and other factors 
in addition  the credit crisis and current recession in the us may affect consumer confidence levels and reduce consumers ability or willingness to use credit  including our transaction based credit product  which could impair the growth of the bill me later business 
as of december   bill me later had an aggregate consumer loan portfolio of approximately million 
like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer loans  the bill me later service faces the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations  resulting in accounts becoming uncollectible  and the risk of potential charge offs related to the loan portfolio 
the nonpayment rate among bill me later users may increase due to  among other things  worsening economic conditions  such as the current recession in the us  and higher unemployment rates 
consumers who miss payments on their loans often fail to repay them  and consumers who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans 
the age and rate of growth of a consumer loan portfolio also affects the rate of missed payments and loans charged off as uncollectible 
consumers are less likely to miss their payments within the first to months of a loan s term 
when a lender makes fewer loans than it has in the past  the proportion of new loans in its portfolio will decrease and the rate of missed payments and charge offs in the portfolio will increase 
in addition  bill me later faces other risks similar to those faced by paypal  including the risk of systems failures  security breaches or other loss of customer data  fraud  intellectual property claims  compliance failures  and changes to regulations relating to credit offerings described in these risk factors  including under the captions government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties and if our payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations  including those governing money transmission  electronic funds transfer  money laundering  banking and lending  it could be subject to liability  licensure and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business practices 
our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes 
the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax  value added tax  or vat  goods and services tax  business tax  and gross receipt tax to ecommerce businesses such as ebay and to our users is a complex and evolving issue 
many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce 
in many cases  it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the internet or electronic commerce or communications conducted over the internet 
in addition  some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the internet or some aspect of electronic commerce or communications on the internet 
for example  the state of new york recently passed new legislation that requires any out of state seller of tangible personal property to collect and remit new york use tax if the seller engages affiliates in new york to perform certain business promotion activities 
several ecommerce companies are challenging this new law  which was recently upheld by a lower level new york court 
while this new law does not specifically apply to our businesses it may adversely affect our sellers and indirectly harm our business 
from time to time  some taxing authorities have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes 
in may  the city of chicago notified both ebay and stubhub that they are liable for a city amusement tax on tickets to events in chicago  irrespective of the location of the buyer or seller  and has filed suit to enforce collection of taxes they claim are due 
the application of similar existing or future laws could have adverse effects on our business 
several proposals have been made at the us state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services or communications through the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially 
table of contents impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands  and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities 
the us federal government s moratorium on state and local taxation of internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce was extended through november this moratorium does not prohibit federal  state  or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium and or one of its extensions 
in conjunction with the streamlined sales tax project an ongoing  multi year effort by us  state  and local governments to require collection and remittance of distant sales tax by out of state sellers bills have been introduced in recent years in the us congress to overturn the supreme court s quill decision  which limits the ability of state governments to require sellers outside of their own state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by in state residents 
such legislation may be considered by the us congress as a way to enable states to increase sales tax revenues and help address significant state budget difficulties caused by the economic downturn 
the adoption of any legislation overturning the quill decision that lacks a robust small business exemption would harm our users and our business 
we do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services 
one or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection  reporting or record keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce 
such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance and legislation to such effect has been discussed in the us congress  several states  and a number of foreign jurisdictions or if an ebay company was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which ebay operates 
in july  the housing and economic recovery act of hr was signed into law 
this law contains provisions that require companies like paypal to report to the irs information on payments received by some of our customers 
the legislation  effective for payments received after december   will require paypal and similar companies to report to the irs us based customers who receive more than  in payments and more than payments in a year 
this law will require paypal to request tax id numbers from us users and track payments by tax id number 
this requirement may decrease seller activity and harm our business 
one or more other jurisdictions may also seek to impose tax collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction  regardless of where the respective users are located 
imposition of a discriminatory record keeping or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business 
foreign authorities may also require ebay to help ensure compliance by our users with local laws regulating professional sellers  including tax requirements 
in addition  we have periodically received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites  and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data 
the imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers  especially requirements that are imposed on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce  and any use of those records to investigate  collect taxes from  or prosecute sellers  could decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business 
we pay input vat on applicable taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate 
in most cases  we are entitled to reclaim this input vat from the various countries 
however  because of our unique business model  the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain 
a successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim vat could harm our business 
we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify ebay s obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations 
passage of new legislation and the imposition of additional tax or tax related reporting requirements could harm our users and our business 
there have been  and will continue to be  substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which ebay conducts or will conduct business 
the current regulatory environment for voice over internet protocol voip is uncertain  and skype s business could be harmed by new regulations or the application of existing regulations to its products 
the current regulatory environment for voip is uncertain and rapidly changing 
skype believes that its internet communications products are currently subject to few  if any  of the same regulations that apply to traditional telephony and voip based telephone replacement services 
voip companies are generally subject to different 
table of contents regulatory regimes in different countries  and in most cases are subject to lower  or no  regulatory fees and lesser  or no  specific regulatory requirements 
however  the status of voip providers is uncertain in many jurisdictions and skype frequently must respond to inquiries about its regulatory status 
regulatory agencies may require skype to conform to rules that are difficult or impossible for it to comply with due to the nature of its communications technologies  which could adversely affect its business 
for example  while suitable alternatives may be developed in the future  skype is currently unable to identify the exact geographic origin of the traffic traversing the internet or to provide detailed calling information about computer to computer communications  either of which may make complying with future regulatory requirements  such as emergency service requirements  difficult or impossible 
governments may impose new or increased fees  taxes  and administrative burdens on voip companies  or skype may change its product offerings in a manner that subjects it to telecommunications regulations 
increased fees could include access and other charges payable to local exchange carriers to carry and terminate traffic  contributions to federal or state universal service funds in the united states and elsewhere  and other charges 
in addition  such fees may be assessed by governments retroactively or prospectively 
skype may be required to meet various emergency service requirements  disability access requirements  user protection requirements  number assignment and portability requirements  and interception or wiretapping requirements  such as the communications assistance for law enforcement act in the us and similar laws in other jurisdictions 
such regulations could result in substantial costs depending on the technical changes required to accommodate the requirements  and any increased costs could erode skype s pricing advantage over competing forms of communication 
regulations that decrease the degree of privacy for users of skype s products could also slow its adoption 
the increasing growth and popularity of internet communications heightens the risk that governments will seek to regulate voip and internet communications  and skype has received an increasing number of inquiries from regulators about its products and services 
competitors  including the incumbent telephone companies  may devote substantial lobbying efforts to seek greater protection for their existing businesses and increased regulation of voip 
in the united states  various state legislatures and regulatory agencies are beginning to impose their own requirements and taxes on voip 
some countries have prohibited skype 
in many countries in which skype products are available  the laws that may relate to its offerings are unclear 
we cannot be certain that skype or its customers are currently in full compliance with regulatory or other legal requirements in all countries in which skype is used 
skype s failure or the failure of those with whom skype transacts business to comply with these requirements could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  increased regulatory requirements on voip would increase skype s costs  and  as a result  our business would suffer 
new rules and regulations with respect to voip are being considered in various countries around the world  and at least some of these rules and regulations are likely to be adopted and to be applicable to skype 
such new rules and regulations are likely to increase our costs of doing business and could prevent us from delivering our products and offerings over the internet  which could adversely affect skype s customer base  and thus its revenue 
skype depends on key technology that is licensed from third parties 
skype licenses technology underlying certain key components of its software from third parties it does not control  including the technology underlying its peer to peer architecture and firewall traversal technology and the video compression decompression used to provide high video quality 
although skype has contracts in place with its third party technology providers  there can be no assurance that the licensed technology or other technology that we may seek to license in the future will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  existing licenses could result in a decrease in service quality or loss of service until equivalent technology or suitable alternatives can be developed  identified  licensed and integrated 
while we believe skype generally has the ability to either extend these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or identify and obtain or develop suitable alternatives  the costs associated with licensing or developing such alternatives could be high and the technical challenge of assuring backward compatibility with older versions of skype s technology may be difficult to overcome 
any failure to maintain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or to license or develop alternative technologies would harm skype s business 
skype and one of its licensors are currently attempting to resolve a dispute concerning certain key licensed technology 
the parties previously entered into a standstill agreement to allow further time to resolve the dispute without the possibility of immediate litigation 
while skype is continuing to attempt to resolve the matter  in february  skype terminated this standstill 
table of contents agreement  and either party may commence a lawsuit against the other party beginning in march although skype is confident of its legal position  as with any litigation  there is the possibility of an adverse result if the matter is not resolved through negotiation 
in such event  continued operation of skype s business as currently conducted would likely not be possible 
our businesses depend on continued and unimpeded access to the internet 
internet service providers may be able to block  degrade  or charge us or our users additional fees for our offerings 
our customers rely on access to the internet to use our products and services 
in many cases that access is provided by companies that compete with at least some of our offerings  including incumbent telephone companies  cable companies  mobile communications companies  and large internet service providers 
some of these providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade  disrupt  or increase the cost of customers use of our offerings by restricting or prohibiting the use of their lines for our offerings  by filtering  blocking  delaying  or degrading the packets containing the data associated with our products  or by charging increased fees to us or our users for use of their lines to provide our offerings 
some of these providers have contractually restricted their customers access to voip offerings which would include skype through their terms of service with their customers 
these activities are technically feasible and may be permitted by applicable law 
in addition  internet service providers could attempt to charge us each time our customers use our offerings 
worldwide  a number of companies have announced plans to take such actions or are selling products designed to facilitate such actions 
interference with our offerings or higher charges for access to our offerings  whether paid by us or by our customers  could cause us to lose existing customers  impair our ability to attract new customers  and harm our revenue and growth 
our tickets business is subject to regulatory  competitive  and other risks that could harm this business 
our tickets business  which includes our stubhub business  is subject to numerous risks 
many jurisdictions have laws and regulations covering the resale of event tickets  and some jurisdictions prohibit the resale of event tickets at prices above the face value of the tickets 
in addition  new laws and regulations may be passed that would limit our or our users ability to continue this business 
regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations or that we or our users are either subject to licensure or prohibited from reselling event tickets in their jurisdictions 
some event organizers and professional sports teams have expressed concern about the resale of their event tickets on our sites 
in november  the new england patriots filed suit against stubhub alleging that stubhub s resale activities violate massachusetts ticket resale laws and constitute intentional interference with the team s relationship with its season ticket holders 
suits alleging a variety of causes of actions have in the past  and may in the future  be filed against stubhub by venue owners  competitors  ticket buyers and unsuccessful ticket buyers 
such litigation could result in damage awards  could require us to change our business practices in ways that may be harmful to our business  or could otherwise negatively affect our tickets business 
our tickets business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events and live entertainment industries 
the recent economic downturn has resulted in a decrease in ticket prices sold on our site and has adversely affected revenue and profits 
our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources  including ticketing service companies such as ticketmaster and tickets 
com  event organizers such as professional sports teams and leagues  ticket brokers  and other online and offline ticket resellers  such as ticketsnow which is owned by ticketmaster and razorgator 
in addition  ticketing service companies and event organizers have recently begun to issue event tickets through paperless electronic ticketing systems that include restrictions on the transferability of such event tickets 
to the extent that event tickets issued in this manner cannot be resold on our websites  or to the extent that we are otherwise unable to compete with these competitors  our tickets business could be harmed 
we depend on key personnel 
our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel and our ability to retain and motivate them 
we recently changed our chief executive officer and the heads of all three of our business units 
these changes may result in increased attrition of our personnel as new 
table of contents reporting relationships are established and as other companies may increasingly target our executives 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel  we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies  and many members of our senior management team have fully vested the vast majority of their in the money equity incentives 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
our new businesses all depend on attracting and retaining key personnel 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  and customer support personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate  or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in making employment decisions  particularly in the internet and high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment 
fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices 
similarly  decreases in the number of unvested in the money stock options held by existing employees  whether because our stock price has declined  options have vested  or because the size of follow on option grants has declined  may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees 
in the fourth quarter of  we undertook a plan to reduce our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization  improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses 
these changes have resulted in the recording of related accounting charges and could harm employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business 
problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our users could harm our business 
a number of parties provide services to us or to our users that benefit us 
such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings  merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software  storefronts that help our users list items  caching services that make our sites load faster  and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on our platform  among others 
in some cases we have contractual agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial interest in their success  while in other cases we have none 
paypal is dependent on the processing companies and banks that link paypal to the credit card and bank clearing networks 
similarly  bill me later relies heavily on third parties to operate its services  including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions 
financial  regulatory  or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions or payments on our websites more difficult  and thereby harm our business 
price increases by companies that provide services to our users could also reduce the number of listings on our websites or make it more difficult for our users to complete transactions  thereby harming our business 
for example  we believe recent changes in postal rates may have reduced listing volume on our sites in certain categories 
any security breach at one of these companies could also adversely affect our customers and harm our business 
in addition  we have outsourced certain functions to third party outside providers  including customer support and product development functions  which are critical to our operations 
if our service providers do not perform satisfactorily  our operations could be disrupted  which could result in user dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business  reputation and operating results 
although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with third parties who provide services to us on acceptable terms  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future  and there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to our users will continue to do so at reasonable rates or at all 
in addition  the current recession in the us and a worldwide economic slowdown may impact the ability of our outside service providers to fulfill their obligations to us or our users 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support or anti fraud measures could diminish use of our services 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services 
measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to damage relations with our customers or decrease activity on our sites by making our sites more difficult to use or restricting the activities of certain users 
these measures heighten the need for 
table of contents prompt and accurate customer support to resolve irregularities and disputes 
effective customer support requires significant personnel expense  and this expense  if not managed properly  could significantly impact our profitability 
failure to manage or train our customer support representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively 
if we do not handle customer complaints effectively  our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence 
because it is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment  paypal  unlike ebay  must provide telephone as well as email customer support and must resolve certain customer contacts within shorter time frames 
as part of paypal s program to reduce fraud losses and prevent money laundering  it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customer s account activity are identified by paypal s risk models as suspicious 
paypal has in the past received negative publicity with respect to its customer support and account restrictions  and has been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state attorney general inquiries alleging  among other things  failure to resolve account restrictions promptly 
if paypal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a cost effective manner  paypal s users may have negative experiences  paypal may receive additional negative publicity  its ability to attract new customers may be damaged  and it could become subject to additional litigation 
as a result  current and future revenues could suffer  and its operating margins may decrease 
in addition  negative publicity about  or negative experiences with  customer support for any of our businesses could cause our reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in our brands as a whole 
our industry is intensely competitive  and other companies or governmental agencies may allege that our behavior is anti competitive 
marketplaces marketplaces businesses currently or potentially compete with a number of companies providing both particular categories of goods and broader ranges of goods 
the internet provides new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the barriers to entry into these channels are relatively low and current offline and new competitors  including small businesses who want to create and promote their own stores  can easily launch online sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software or partnering with any one of a number of successful ecommerce companies 
our broad based competitors include the vast majority of traditional department  warehouse  discount  and general merchandise stores as well as the online operations of these traditional retailers  emerging online retailers  online classified services  and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks 
among others  these include wal mart  target  sears  macy s  jc penney  costco  office depot  staples  officemax  sam s club  amazon 
com  buy 
com  aol 
com  yahoo shopping  msn  qvc  and home shopping network 
a number of companies offer a variety of services that provide channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes  including online aggregation and classifieds websites such as craigslist in which we own a minority equity stake  google base  microsoft live expo  and oodle 
com 
our classifieds websites  including kijiji  marktplaats  mobile 
de  and gumtree  offer classifieds listings in the us and a variety of local international markets 
in many markets in which it operates  including in the us  our classified platforms compete against more established online and offline classifieds platforms 
in  we acquired shopping 
com ltd  an online shopping comparison site 
shopping 
com competes with sites such as buy 
com  google s product search  nextag 
com  pricegrabber 
com  shopzilla  and yahoo product search  which offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the internet for specified products 
recent legal developments may affect the utility of shopping comparison sites if manufacturers begin requiring more uniformity in product pricing 
in addition  sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels  including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search related advertisements on search engine sites such as google and yahoo 
we use product search engines and paid search advertising to channel users to our sites  but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations 
we also compete with many local  regional  and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each of the major categories of products offered on our websites 
for example  category specific competitors to offerings in our 
table of contents collectibles category include  among others  artfact  beckett  bonhams butterfields  bowers and morena  christie s  collectiblestoday 
com  collectors universe  etsy  franklin mint  go collect  heritage  littletoncoin  mastronet  replacements 
com  ruby lane  shop at home  sotheby s  tias  us mint  us postal service  antique and collectible dealers  antique and collectible fairs  auction houses  estate sales  flea markets and swap meets  independent coin and stamp dealers  and specialty retailers 
our international marketplaces websites compete with similar online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories in most countries 
in addition  they compete with general online ecommerce sites  such as quelle and otto in germany  leboncoin 
fr and price minister in france  tradus recently acquired by naspers in poland  yahoo kimo in taiwan  lotte and gmarket in south korea  trading post  oztion and aussie bidder in australia  and amazon in the united kingdom and other countries 
in some of these countries  there are online sites that have much larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do  and in certain of these jurisdictions there are competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do 
the principal competitive factors for marketplaces include the following ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers  volume of transactions and price and selection of goods  customer service  and brand recognition 
with respect to our online competition  additional competitive factors include community cohesion  interaction and size  website ease of use and accessibility  level of trust in the seller  system reliability  reliability of delivery and payment  level of service fees  and quality of search tools 
some current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet sectors than we do 
other online trading services may be acquired by  receive investments from  or enter into other commercial relationships with well established and well financed companies 
as a result  some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we can 
some of our competitors have offered services for free and others may do this as well 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in addition  certain offline competitors may encourage manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products to dealers who sell through online channels such as ebay  or may attempt to use existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods or services 
the adoption by manufacturers or government authorities of policies or regulations discouraging the sales of goods or services over the internet could force ebay users to stop selling certain products on our websites 
increased competition or anti internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and diminished value of our brand 
in order to respond to changes in the competitive environment  we may  from time to time  make pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among a number of our sellers  and which could harm our profitability 
conversely  other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us or other countries  or otherwise constitute unfair competition 
such claims  even if without foundation  typically are very expensive to defend  involve negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort  and could result in significant judgments against us 

table of contents in several jurisdictions  we have taken actions designed to improve the safety of transactions on our websites 
beginning in june  we have required users in the uk to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized uk website  and since october  we require sellers on ebay 
com to accept one or more accepted payment methods currently paypal  credit or debit cards processed through internet merchant accounts  and or propay and no longer allow any forms of paper payment  including checks and money orders  to be used in the us for most categories of items 
while these initiatives are intended to improve and make safer our users buying experience and or increase activity on our sites  certain users may be negatively affected by or react negatively to these changes 
we currently face inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to such actions 
for example  the reserve bank of australia is currently reviewing our policy requiring sellers to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized australian website and precluding them from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting paypal or other payment methods 
we may face similar inquiries from other government regulators in the future 
any negative reaction to these changes by our users or government authorities could  among other things  force us to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business  operating results and profitability 
in addition  certain competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping or other transaction related services  which could be impractical or inefficient for ebay sellers to match 
new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service 
although we have established internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies  these arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or these companies may decide to promote competitive services 
even if these arrangements are renewed  they may not result in increased usage of our services 
in addition  companies that control user access to transactions through network access  internet browsers  or search engines  could promote our competitors  channel current or potential users to their vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their advertisers sites  attempt to restrict our access  or charge us substantial fees for inclusion 
search engines are increasingly becoming a starting point for online shopping  and as the costs of operating an online store decline  online sellers may increasingly sell goods through multiple channels  which could reduce the number and value of transactions these sellers conduct through our sites 
paypal the markets for paypal s product are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid technological change  including but not limited to mobile payments  electronic funds transfer networks starting to allow internet access  cross border access to networks  creation of new networks  expansion of prepaid cards  and bill pay networks 
paypal competes with existing online and offline payment methods  including  among others credit card merchant processors that offer their services to online merchants  including american express  cardservice international  chase paymentech  first data  and wells fargo  and payment gateways  including cybersource and authorize 
net which has merged with cybersource  money remitters such as moneygram and western union  bill payment services  including checkfree  processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account  including certegy  ebillme  revolution money and telecheck  a subsidiary of first data  or to pay on credit  providers of traditional payment methods  particularly credit cards  checks  money orders  and automated clearing house transactions  issuers of stored value targeted at online payments  including visabuxx  netspend and greendot  mobile payments  including obopay  textpayme a subsidiary of amazon  crandy  luup and payforit  amazon payments  which offers online merchants the ability to accept credit card and bank funded payments from amazon s base of online customers on the merchant s own website  and  google checkout  which enables the online payment of merchants using credit cards 

table of contents some of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service and other resources  greater name recognition  or a larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than paypal 
paypal s competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than paypal 
some of these competitors may also be subject to lesser licensing  anti money laundering  and other regulatory requirements than paypal  which is subject to additional regulations based on its licensure as a bank in luxembourg 
they may devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of products and services than paypal  and they may offer lower prices 
for example  google checkout provided free payment processing through february   and currently offers free payments processing on transactions in an amount proportionate to certain advertising spending with google 
competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than paypal 
overseas  paypal faces competition from similar channels and payment methods 
in each country  numerous banks provide standard online credit card acquiring and processing services  and these banks typically have leading market share 
in addition  paypal faces competition from visa s visa direct  mastercard s moneysend  royal bank of scotland s world pay and clickandbuy in the eu  nochex  moneybookers  neteller and firepay in the united kingdom  certapay and hyperwallet in canada  paymate and bpay in australia  alipay  yeepay and bill in china and inicis in south korea 
in addition  in certain countries  such as germany and australia  electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions 
as in the us  established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service 
some of paypal s competitors  such as wells fargo  first data  american express  and royal bank of scotland  also provide processing or foreign exchange services to paypal 
if paypal were to seek to expand the financial products that it offers  either alone or through a commercial alliance or an acquisition  these processing and foreign exchange relationships could be negatively affected  or these competitors and other processors could make it more difficult for paypal to deliver its services 
skype the market for skype s products is also intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
we expect skype s various communications competitors  including  for example  the providers of online communications products and telecommunications operators  to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products  software  services and technologies 
many telecommunications firms offer bundled services  where a group of services that may include cable or satellite television  internet services eg  cable modem or dsl  and telecommunications are offered for a single monthly price 
if skype s competitors successfully introduce new products  offer bundled services or enhance their existing products  this could reduce the market for skype s products  increase price competition  or make skype s products obsolete  which could lower skype s adoption rates  decrease its ability to attract new users or cause its current users to migrate to a competing company 
additionally  several of skype s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  are substantially larger  and have greater financial  marketing  technical  and other resources 
some also have greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than skype has 
our business may be adversely affected by factors that cause our users to spend less time on our websites  including seasonal factors  national events and increased usage of other websites 
anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business 
we would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events such as war  the threat of war  or terrorist activity  and natural disasters  such as hurricanes or earthquakes 
similarly  our results of operations historically have been seasonal because many of our users reduce their activities on our websites with the onset of good weather during the summer months  and on and around national holidays 
in addition  increased usage of social networking 
table of contents or other entertainment websites may decrease the amount of time users spend on our websites  which could adversely affect our financial results 
our failure to cost effectively manage certain aspects of our business could harm us 
we have expanded our headcount  facilities  and infrastructure in the us and internationally  and anticipate that further expansion in certain areas will be required as we continue to expand into new lines of business and geographic areas 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational  and financial resources 
the areas that are put under strain by our growth include the following website usability 
user activity rates on our websites depend in part on the quality of our users experiences on those sites 
the rapid growth in the number and complexity of products and features on our sites has occasionally caused users to become confused or overwhelmed or has otherwise impaired users experiences on those sites 
we are in the process of making numerous improvements to our ebay websites  including an attempt to improve the user experience on those websites 
these attempts at improvement could fail  or could decrease activity among users who had grown used to or preferred the existing experience on our sites 
any impairment of customer satisfaction as a result of site usability issues could lead to a loss of customers or impair our ability to add customers  either of which would harm our business 
website stability 
we must constantly add new hardware  update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and features we regularly introduce 
this upgrade process is expensive  and the increased complexity of our websites and the need to support multiple platforms as our portfolio of brands grows increases the cost of additional enhancements 
failure to upgrade our technology  features  transaction processing systems  security infrastructure  or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could harm our business 
adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer support  impaired quality of users experiences of our services  impaired quality of services for third party application developers using our externally accessible application programming interface  or api  and delays in reporting accurate financial information 
we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses with our existing systems  and any failure to do so could result in problems on our sites 
further  steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive  reduce our margins  and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime 
customer account billing 
our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes 
our failure to grow our transaction processing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on any of our websites would harm our business and our ability to collect revenue 
customer support 
we seek to become more efficient in providing our customer support operations 
we intend to provide an increased level of support including an increasing amount of telephone support in a cost effective manner 
if we are unable to provide customer support in a cost effective manner  users of our websites may have negative experiences  current and future revenues could suffer  our costs may increase and our operating margins may decrease 
we must continue to effectively hire  train  and manage new employees 
if our new hires perform poorly  if we are unsuccessful in hiring  training  managing  and integrating these new employees  or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees  our business may be harmed 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our transaction processing  operational and financial systems  procedures  and controls 
this is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures  and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any capital investments that we may make will increase our cost base  which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short term 

table of contents we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 
the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
like many other multinational corporations  we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate 
our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities  and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations  audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world  including with respect to our tax structure 
any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business  operating results and financial condition  and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 
while we have take reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities  these reserves may prove to be insufficient in the event that any taxing authority is successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our positions 
we depend on the continued growth of online commerce and communications 
the business of selling goods over the internet  particularly through online trading  is dynamic and relatively new 
concerns about fraud  privacy  and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the internet as a medium of commerce 
in countries such as the us  germany and the us  where our services and online commerce generally have been available for some time and the level of market penetration of our services is high  acquiring new users for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past 
in order to expand our user base  we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and may prefer internet analogues to such traditional retail means to our offerings  such as the retailer s own website 
if these consumers prove to be less active than our earlier users  and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs  including our cost of acquiring new customers  our business could be adversely impacted 
our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the success of our services will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity  and security  as well as timely development of complementary products  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands 
in addition  increasing numbers of users  increasing bandwidth requirements  or problems caused by viruses  worms  malware and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet 
the backbone computers of the internet have been the targets of such programs 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services 
we may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately 
we regard the protection of our trademarks  copyrights  patents  domain names  trade dress  and trade secrets as critical to our success 
we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal  state and common law rights  as well as a variety of administrative procedures 
we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent development of similar technologies by others 
we pursue the registration of our domain names  trademarks  and service marks in the us and internationally 
effective trademark  copyright  patent  domain name  trade dress  and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation 
we must protect our trademarks  patents  and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive and may not be successful in every location 
for example  skype is in the 
table of contents process of applying to register the skype name as a trademark worldwide 
in the eu  skype s application is being opposed 
if these oppositions to skype s applications were to be successful  skype s ability to protect its brand against third party infringers would be compromised 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to others 
these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
we own real property  including land and buildings related to our operations 
we have little experience in managing real property 
ownership of this property subjects us to risks  including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  adverse changes in the value of these properties  due to interest rate changes  changes in the neighborhoods in which the properties are located  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic  disability act  or other requirements  and possible disputes with tenants  neighboring owners  or others 
some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences  rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
this restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
item b unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties we own and lease various properties in the united states and other countries around the world 
we use the properties for executive and administrative offices  data centers  product development offices and customer service offices 
as of december   our owned and leased properties provided us with aggregate square footage of approximately million and million  respectively 
our corporate headquarters of approximately million square feet are located in san jose  california

item legal proceedings in august  louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture filed two lawsuits in the paris court of commerce against ebay inc and ebay international ag 
among other things  the complaint alleges that we violated french tort law by negligently broadcasting listings posted by third parties offering counterfeit items 
table of contents bearing plaintiffs trademarks  and by purchasing certain advertising keywords 
around september  parfums christian dior  kenzo parfums  parfums givenchy  and guerlain soci t also filed a lawsuit in the paris court of commerce against ebay inc and ebay international ag 
the complaint alleges that we have interfered with the selective distribution network the plaintiffs established in france and the european union by allowing third parties to post listings offering genuine perfumes and cosmetics for sale on our websites 
in june  the paris court of commerce ruled that ebay and ebay international ag were liable for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit items on its websites that traded on plaintiffs brand names and for interfering with the plaintiffs selective distribution network 
the court awarded plaintiffs approximately eur million in damages and issued an injunction prohibiting all sales of perfumes and cosmetics bearing the dior  guerlain  givenchy and kenzo brands over all worldwide ebay sites to the extent that they are accessible from france 
we have taken measures to comply with the injunction and have appealed these rulings 
however  these and similar suits may force us to modify our business practices  which could lower our revenue  increase our costs  or make our websites less convenient to our customers 
any such results could materially harm our business 
other luxury brand owners have also filed suit against us or have threatened to do so  seeking to hold us liable for  among other things  alleged counterfeit items listed on our websites by third parties  for tester and other not for resale consumer products listed on our websites by third parties  for the alleged misuse of trademarks in listings  for alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws  for alleged non compliance of consumer protection laws or in connection with paid search advertisements

table of contents ebay s korean subsidiary  iac  has notified a majority of its approximately million users of a data breach involving personally identifiable information including name  address  resident registration number and some transaction and refund data but not including credit card information or real time banking information 
approximately  users have sued iac over this breach in several lawsuits in korean courts and we expect more to do so in the future 
there is some precedent in korea for a court to grant consolation money for data breaches without a specific finding of harm from the breach 
such precedents have involved payments of up to approximately per user 
a consumer agency recently made a non binding recommendation that iac make payments of  korean won approximately to consumers who had complained to it as a result of such breach 
iac intends to vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit 
other third parties have from time to time claimed  and others may claim in the future  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we are subject to additional patent disputes  and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope and complexity 
in particular  we expect that we may face additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces  payments and communications businesses 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act  the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts  and as we become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable 
we believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us 
intellectual property claims  whether meritorious or not  are time consuming and costly to resolve  could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business  or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company grows larger 
any claims or regulatory actions against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require significant amounts of management time  and result in the diversion of significant operational resources

table of contents you should read the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
overview we operate three primary business segments marketplaces  payments and communications 
our marketplaces segment provides the infrastructure to enable global online commerce on a variety of platforms  including the traditional ebay 
com platform  and our other online platforms  such as our online classifieds businesses  our secondary tickets marketplace stubhub  our online shopping comparison website shopping 
com  our apartment listing service platform rent 
com  as well as our fixed price media marketplace half 
com 
our payments segment is comprised of our online payment solutions paypal which enables individuals and businesses to securely  easily and quickly send and receive payments online in approximately markets worldwide and bill me later which we acquired in november and which enables online us merchants to offer  and us consumers to obtain  transactional credit at the point of sale 
our communications segment  which consists of skype  enables voip calls between skype users and provides low cost connectivity to traditional fixed line and mobile telephones 
overall  revenue increased to billion  diluted earnings per share increased from to and operating cash flow increased to billion 
paypal  classifieds  advertising in particular text and graphical advertising and skype were the key drivers of growth  with these businesses achieving a revenue growth rate of   and  respectively 
we also achieved an operating margin of  with segment margins flat or better across all three of our business segments despite the deteriorating global economic environment in the latter half of however  we experienced declining revenue growth rates in total and on a segment basis 
during  two of our key priorities were to reaccelerate the gross merchandise volume gmv growth in our marketplaces core business and to grow our payments business off the ebay platform paypal s merchant services business 
in order to reaccelerate growth in gmv  we focused our actions in on improving ebay s marketplaces by expanding selection  improving our trust and safety  and making it easier to find great values 
we will continue to focus on evolving a large and complex marketplace to reaccelerate growth in our core business 
we also made it a priority to expand the presence of paypal beyond the ebay 
com platform to better diversify our revenue sources and reduce our dependence on the ebay 
com platform 
during the second half of  net total payment volume generated by paypal s merchant services business exceeded volume on the ebay 
com platform 
paypal s merchant services business grew in as we expanded adoption of paypal across the internet 
our acquisition of bill me later in november is expected to enhance our leadership position in online payment solutions 
over the last three years  we have expanded our global footprint with approximately of revenues now coming from outside the us and diversified our revenue stream with approximately of revenues now coming from non marketplaces transaction revenues 
some key operating metrics that members of our senior management regularly review to evaluate our financial results include gmv  number of sold items  net total payment volume  merchant services net total payment volume  skypeout minutes  free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures  and revenue  excluding acquisitions and foreign currency impact 
outlook the current uncertain economic environment and volatile foreign currency exchange rates make it difficult to identify trends likely to impact our financial results beyond the first quarter of we expect revenues and net 
table of contents income in the first quarter of to be lower than the first quarter of due primarily to the effect of an anticipated stronger us dollar as well as the negative impact of the economic environment on consumer spending and the challenges associated with reaccelerating growth of gmv in our marketplaces core business 
although the current economic environment makes it difficult to predict the impact on individual types of expenses  we expect that cost controls  including our previously announced restructuring that impacts our employee related operating expenses  will partially offset the negative effects of an anticipated year over year decline in revenues and our expected investments in our higher growth businesses such as payments  classifieds and communications 
we also expect diluted earnings per share will be negatively impacted by lower interest rates and from dilution resulting from recent acquisitions 
results of operations net revenues our net transaction revenues from our marketplaces segment are derived primarily from listing and final value fees paid by sellers 
for our payments segment  net transaction revenues are generated primarily by fees paid by merchants for payment processing services 
our communications segment net transaction revenues are generated primarily from fees charged to users to connect skype s voip product to traditional fixed line and mobile telephones 
these fees are charged on a per minute basis or on a subscription basis and we refer to these minutes as skypeout minutes 
our marketing services and other revenue are generated from all three of our business segments 
our marketing services are derived principally from the sale of advertisements  revenue sharing arrangements  classifieds fees  lead referral fees 
our other revenues are derived principally from interest earned from banks on certain paypal customer account balances  interest and fees earned on the bill me later loan portfolio and from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide services to all of our users 
revenues are attributed to us and international geographies primarily based upon the country in which the seller  payment recipient  customer  skype user s internet protocol address  online property that generates advertising  or other service provider  as the case may be  is located 
because we generate the majority of our revenue internationally  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will impact our results of operations 
based on changes in foreign currency rates year over year  total net revenues for the year ended december  were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately million compared to the prior year 
on a business segment basis  marketplaces  payments and communications total net revenues for the year ended december  were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
total net revenues for the year ended december  were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately million compared to the prior year 
on a business segment basis  marketplaces  payments and communications total net revenues for the year ended december  were positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
impact of foreign currency translation only includes changes between our functional currencies and our us dollar reporting currency

excluding vehicles  gmv would have increased due primarily to an increase in our second largest category  consumer electronics

stock repurchases under these programs may be made through a variety of open market and privately negotiated transactions  including structured stock repurchase transactions or other derivative transactions  at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from the company s working capital or other financing alternatives 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including corporate and regulatory requirements  price and other market conditions and management s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash

if these cash and cash equivalents were distributed to the us we may be subject to additional us taxes in certain circumstances 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our available cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposits and money market funds 
we actively monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while secondarily maximizing yield on those funds 
we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
to date  we have experienced no material loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
these balances in the us may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits

commitments and contingencies we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes 
changes in our business needs  contractual cancellation provisions  fluctuating interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables  in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments in thousands operating purchase payments due by year ending december  leases obligations total thereafter operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early 
purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising  capital expenditures computer equipment  software applications  engineering development services  construction contracts and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business 
for those contractual arrangements in which there are significant performance requirements  we have developed estimates to project expected payment obligations 
these estimates have been developed based upon historical trends  when available  and our anticipated future obligations 
given the significance of such performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements  actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates 
we have billion outstanding under our credit agreement at december   which we have classified as a current liability 
we may repay the amount outstanding under the line of credit within the next twelve months 
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  the table does not include million of such non current liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

this arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from this financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held in europe within the same financial institution aggregate cash 
table of contents deposits 
this arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreed upon limit 
the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income

customer balances held as direct claims against us  primarily paypal  are included on our consolidated balance sheet in funds receivable and customer accounts with an offsetting current liability in funds payable and amounts due to customers  and totaled approximately billion as of december  and customer funds held by paypal as an agent or custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
these funds include funds on behalf of us customers that are deposited in bank accounts insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation and funds that us customers choose to invest in the paypal money market fund  which totaled approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the paypal money market fund is invested in a portfolio managed by barclays global fund advisors 
indemnification provisions in the ordinary course of business  we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations  including our standard marketing  promotions and application programming interface license agreements 
under these contracts  we generally indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names  trademarks  logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement 
in a limited number of agreements  we have provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims  which are indemnities mainly related to various intellectual property rights 
in our paypal business  we have provided an indemnity to our payment processors in the event of certain third party claims or card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by paypal or paypal customers 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision 
to date  no significant costs have been incurred  either individually or collectively  in connection with our indemnification provisions 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 

table of contents provision for transaction and loan losses we are exposed to losses due to uncollectible receivable and loan accounts  credit card and other payment misuse  as well as non performance of and loan losses from sellers who accept payment through paypal 
provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses based on our historical experience  actuarial techniques  the age and delinquency rates of receivables  the credit quality of the relevant loan  as well as economic and regulatory conditions 
the following table illustrates the provision as a percentage of net revenues for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  net revenues provision for transaction and loan losses provision for transaction and loan losses as a of net revenues determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses 
the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date 
an aggregate basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately million resulting in an approximate change in diluted earnings per share 
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss  net of expected recoveries  and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in item a risk factors  item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies litigation and other legal matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees  modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three businesses 
accounting for income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences is reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income or against additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent any tax benefits would have otherwise been allocated to equity 

table of contents our us businesses generate sufficient cash flow to fully fund their operating requirements  and we expect that profits earned outside the us will be fully utilized to fund our continued international expansion 
accordingly  we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
in the event that our future international expansion plans change and such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely  we would be subject to us income taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits 
the following table illustrates our effective tax rates for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  provision for income taxes as a of income before income taxes we believe historically  these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes or interpretations in tax laws  regulations or accounting principles 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service  various state tax authorities and other various foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately million  resulting in an approximate change in diluted earnings per share 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of the beginning of prior to adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
the effects of final resolution  if any  were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
fin requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
if the recognition threshold is met  fin permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that  in our judgment  is more than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
it further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we may enter into certain revenue transactions that involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple arrangements  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  whether the arrangement should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent  whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the purchase arrangements with our customer for which we can reasonably estimate fair value  and whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or 
table of contents reimbursement of costs incurred 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
goodwill and intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
at december   our goodwill totaled billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled million 
we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
additionally  certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models  which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units  particularly our communications reporting unit 
we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of this test we determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any reportable units was required 
as a result our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august   we concluded that the carrying amount of our communications reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment loss of approximately billion during the year ended december  the impairment charge includes the impact of the earn out settlement payment with certain former shareholders of skype and was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill in our communications reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill 
see note business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
there was no impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets in as of december   we determined that no events or circumstances from august  through december  indicate that a further assessment was necessary 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted fas r  which requires a fair value measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  employee stock purchases and restricted stock awards over the service period for awards expected to vest 
stock based compensation expense recognized for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
see note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we calculated the fair value of each restricted stock award based on our stock price on the date of grant 
we calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
the use of a black scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
as a result  the future stock based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts

revised  business combinations fas r 
fas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  as well as the goodwill acquired 
significant changes from current practice resulting from fas r include the expansion of the definitions of a business and a business combination 
for all business combinations whether partial  full or step acquisitions  the acquirer will record of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business  including goodwill  generally at their fair values  contingent consideration will be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and  for certain arrangements  changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings until settlement  and acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition 
fas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
fas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  fas r may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the nature and magnitude of the specific impact will depend upon the nature  terms  and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas amends accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  which is sometimes referred to as minority interest  is a third party ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements 
among other requirements  fas requires the consolidated statement of income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
fas also requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated statement of income of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets  as of december   approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio were held in bank deposits and money market funds 
as such  changes in interest rates will impact interest income 
as of december   we held no direct investments in auction rate securities  collateralized debt obligations  structured investment vehicles or mortgaged backed securities 
additionally  changes in interest rates will impact our interest sensitive credit agreement and accordingly  impact interest expense or cost of net revenues 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on marketable equity instruments due to market volatility 
at december   the total fair value of our marketable equity instruments was million  which represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio 
investment risk as of december   our recorded cost basis and equity investments was million 
these investments relate primarily to equity method investments in private companies 
we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is other than temporary 
our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends  recent sales acquisitions of the investee securities  and other publicly available data 
foreign currency exposures an increasing proportion of our operations conducted outside the us our foreign currency exposure continues to evolve as we grow internationally 
the objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow and results of operations 
international net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  certain foreign operations use the local currency  which is primarily the euro  and to a lesser extent  the british pound australian dollars and korean won  as their functional currency 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate 
table of contents volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction  economic and translation transaction exposure around the world  we have various assets and liabilities  primarily receivables  investments and accounts payable including inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables  investments and payables recognized in earnings 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately million with maturity dates within days 
transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in interest and other income  net included in our consolidated statement of income 
economic exposure we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting us to foreign currency risks 
in addition  we charge our international subsidiaries on a monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services provided by ebay and by paypal 
these charges are denominated in euros and these forecasted inter company transactions represent a foreign currency cash flow exposure 
we purchase foreign exchange contracts  generally with maturities of months or less  to reduce the volatility of cash flows related primarily to forecasted revenue and intercompany transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies 
the objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the us dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the us dollar foreign currency exchange rate 
pursuant to financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  we expect the hedge of certain of these forecasted transactions to be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the us dollar foreign currency exchange rate 
accordingly  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into the financial statements line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
during the year ended december  the realized gains on these hedges were million 
during the years ended december  and  the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant 
the notional amount of our economic hedges designated for hedge accounting treatment was million and as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   net of losses  our unrealized gains related to economic hedges recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income was million 
the loss  net of gains  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  was not significant 
we did not have any economic hedges in place as of december  translation exposure as our international operations grow  fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase foreign exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency fluctuations 
such contracts will be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be recorded in interest and other income  net 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position at the end of december   
table of contents was a net translation gain of approximately million 
this gain is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated statement of income 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted our consolidated net revenues and operating income for the year ended december  by approximately million and million  respectively  compared to the prior year 
impact of foreign currency translation only includes changes between our functional currencies and our us dollar reporting currency 
we consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by converting them into us dollars in accordance with fas no 
foreign currency translation fas 
such earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using either exchange contracts or other instruments 
all contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which they are executed 
during the year ended december   the realized gains related to these hedges was approximately million 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  british pound  australian dollar  and korean won in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decrease increase to operating income of approximately million 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income
