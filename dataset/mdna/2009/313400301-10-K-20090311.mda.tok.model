item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary you should read this md a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december  our financial results for the year ended december  reflect the adverse conditions in the us mortgage markets during the year  which deteriorated dramatically during the second half of the year 
we also experienced major changes in our regulatory environment and our management and supervision during the year  principally associated with our entry into conservatorship 
under conservatorship  we have made changes to certain business practices that are designed to provide support for the mortgage market in a manner that serves public policy and other non financial objectives but that may not contribute to profitability 
some of these changes have increased our expenses or caused us to forego revenue opportunities 
deterioration of market conditions  including rapidly declining home prices  higher mortgage delinquency rates and higher loss severities  contributed to large credit related expenses for the third and fourth quarters and the full year of in addition  non cash fair value adjustments and a partial valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets have resulted in deficits in our stockholders equity and made it necessary for us to make large draws on treasury s funding commitment 
these draws will result in a large dividend obligation on our senior preferred stock 
we expect to make additional draws on treasury s funding commitment in the future 
the size of such draws will be determined by a variety of factors  including whether market conditions continue to deteriorate 
conservatorship for information on the conservatorship  see business conservatorship and related developments 
the conservatorship and related developments have had a wide ranging impact on us  including our regulatory supervision  management  business objectives  financial condition and results of operations 
the conservatorship has no specified termination date 
there can be no assurance as to when or how the conservatorship will be terminated or what changes may occur to our business structure during or following conservatorship  including whether we will continue to exist 
key actions related to the conservatorship and the conduct of our business since the conservatorship was established include the following the execution of the purchase agreement with treasury  pursuant to which we issued to treasury both senior preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock  our receipt of billion from treasury in november pursuant to its commitment under the purchase agreement  and fhfa s request to treasury of a draw of billion  the execution of the lending agreement under which treasury has established a temporary secured lending credit facility that is available to us through december   the appointment by the conservator of a new chief executive officer and the appointment of a new non executive chairman and other directors to our reconstituted board of directors david m 
moffett recently resigned as chief executive officer and resigned as a member of our board of directors  effective no later than march   john a 
koskinen has been appointed interim chief executive officer and robert r 
glauber has been appointed interim non executive chairman of the board of directors  effective upon mr 
moffett s resignation  the elimination by the conservator of dividends on common and preferred stock other than on the senior preferred stock  and the announcement by fhfa that existing statutory and fhfa directed regulatory capital requirements will not be binding during the conservatorship 
on february   treasury secretary geithner issued a statement outlining treasury s efforts to strengthen its commitment to us by increasing the funding available under the purchase agreement from billion to billion  affirming treasury s plans to continue purchasing freddie mac mortgage related securities and increasing the size limit on our mortgage related investments portfolio by billion to billion with a corresponding increase in the amount of allowable debt outstanding 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k  the purchase agreement has not been amended to reflect the increase in treasury s commitment 
based on our charter  public statements from treasury and fhfa officials and guidance from our conservator  our business objectives include providing liquidity  stability and affordability in the mortgage market  immediately providing additional assistance to the struggling housing and mortgage markets  reducing the need to draw funds from treasury pursuant to the purchase agreement  freddie mac 
table of contents returning to long term profitability  and protecting the interests of taxpayers 
these objectives create conflicts in strategic and day to day decision making that will likely lead to suboptimal outcomes for one or more  or possibly all  of these objectives 
our business is also subject to significant new restrictions that could limit our ability to achieve one or more of these objectives  including the requirements under the purchase agreement that we i limit the size of our mortgage related investments portfolio to billion as of december  and  thereafter  decrease the size of our mortgage related investments portfolio at the rate of per year until it reaches billion  and ii not incur indebtedness that would result in our aggregate indebtedness exceeding a specified amount  without the prior written consent of treasury 
the balance of our mortgage related investments portfolio and indebtedness at december  did not exceed the purchase agreement limits 
on february   the obama administration announced the hasp  which includes a an initiative that will allow mortgages currently owned or guaranteed by us to be refinanced without obtaining additional credit enhancement beyond that already in place for that loan  and b an initiative to encourage modifications of mortgages for both homeowners who are in default and those who are at risk of imminent default  through various government incentives to servicers  mortgage holders and homeowners 
at present  it is difficult for us to predict the full extent of our activities under these initiatives and assess their impact on us 
however  to the extent that our servicers and borrowers participate in these programs in large numbers  it is likely that the costs we incur associated with modifications of loans  the costs associated with servicer and borrower incentive fees and the potential accounting impacts  will be substantial 
as a result of the draws under the purchase agreement  the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock will increase from billion as of september  to billion 
our annual dividend obligation on the senior preferred stock  based on that liquidation preference  will be billion  which is in excess of our annual historical earnings in most periods 
these dividend obligations make it more likely that we will face increasingly negative cash flows from operations 
to date  our need for funding under the purchase agreement has not been caused by cash flow shortfalls but rather primarily reflects large credit related expenses and non cash fair value adjustments as well as a partial valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets that resulted in reductions to our gaap stockholders equity deficit 
under the purchase agreement  our ability to repay the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock is limited and we may not be able to do so for the foreseeable future  if at all 
the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock and our related dividend obligations could increase further as a result of additional draws under the purchase agreement or any dividends or quarterly commitment fees payable under the purchase agreement that are not paid in cash 
the amounts we are obligated to pay in dividends on the senior preferred stock are substantial and will have an adverse impact on our financial position and net worth and could substantially delay our return to long term profitability or make long term profitability unlikely 
for more information  see risk factors conservatorship and related developments factors including credit losses from our mortgage guarantee activities have had an increasingly negative impact on our cash flows from operations during and as we anticipate these trends to continue for the foreseeable future  it is likely that the company will increasingly rely upon access to the public debt markets as a source of funding for ongoing operations 
for more information on the risks to our business relating to the conservatorship and uncertainties regarding the future of our business  see risk factors 
housing and economic conditions and impact on results the us residential mortgage market experienced substantial deterioration during and early  which adversely affected our financial condition and results of operations 
we expect the residential mortgage market will continue to deteriorate in home price declines accelerated nationwide during  with significant regional variations 
we estimate that the national decline in home prices from the end of the third quarter of until the end of was approximately  based on our own index  which is based on our single family mortgage portfolio 
we believe that there will be additional declines of to during based on our index 
other indices of home price changes may have different results than our own  as they are determined using different pools of mortgage loans 
the percentage decline in home prices was particularly large in california  florida  arizona and nevada  where we have significant concentrations of mortgage loans in our single family mortgage portfolio  which includes loans underlying our pcs and structured securities 
we estimate that home prices  as measured by our index  declined during by   and in california  florida  arizona and nevada  respectively 
unemployment rates also worsened significantly 
the us bureau of labor statistics reported unemployment rates in california  florida  arizona and nevada of   and  respectively  while the national rate was as of december  although inflation moderated by year end  an upward spike in food and energy prices during further eroded household financial conditions  and real consumer spending declined significantly 
both consumer and freddie mac 
table of contents business credit tightened considerably during the second half of as financial institutions curtailed their lending activities 
this contributed to significant increases in credit spreads for both mortgage and corporate loans 
these macroeconomic conditions contributed to a substantial increase in the number of delinquent loans in our single family mortgage portfolio during as well as the rate of transition of these loans from delinquency through foreclosure 
significant increases in market reported delinquency rates for mortgages serviced by financial institutions during were reported not only for subprime and alt a loans  but also for prime loans 
this delinquency data suggests that continuing home price declines and growing unemployment are now affecting behavior by a broader segment of mortgage borrowers  increasing numbers of whom are underwater  or owing more on their mortgage loans than their homes are currently worth 
our loan loss severities  or the average amount of recognized losses per loan  and redefault rates on modified loans also significantly increased during  especially in california  florida  arizona and nevada  where we have significant concentrations of mortgage loans with higher average loan balances than in other states 
we are operating in a challenging environment 
a number of our major customers or counterparties have failed  been acquired  or received substantial government assistance in  including washington mutual bank  lehman brothers holdings inc  or lehman  jp morgan chase co  american international group  inc  bank of america corporation  merrill lynch co  inc  indymac bank  fsb  citigroup inc 
and wachovia corporation 
in an attempt to stabilize the markets and restore liquidity  the us government introduced several unprecedented programs to provide various forms of financial support to market participants 
one of these programs  the troubled asset relief program  or tarp  was created pursuant to eesa to help stabilize the financial markets and has provided more than billion of capital investments into us financial institutions 
many of our largest single family seller servicers participated and have received capital from treasury through the tarp 
another of these programs involves guarantees by the fdic of the debt obligations issued by banks that elect to participate in the program 
certain of these programs and reduced investor demand for corporate debt have limited our access to long term and callable funding 
uncertainty in the debt market has also contributed to an increase in our borrowing costs relative to the us treasury market and libor indices 
see liquidity and capital resources for further information 
adverse market developments have been the principal drivers of our substantially increased losses for our provision for credit losses increased from billion in to billion in  principally due to increased estimates of incurred losses on loans we own or guarantee caused by the deteriorating economic conditions as evidenced by our increased rates of delinquency and foreclosure  increased mortgage loan loss severities  and  to a lesser extent  heightened concerns that certain of our seller servicer counterparties may fail to perform their recourse or repurchase obligations to us 
for information regarding how we derive our estimate for the provision for credit losses  see critical accounting policies and estimates 
the deteriorating market conditions during also led to a considerably more pessimistic outlook for the performance of the non agency mortgage related securities we own 
we recorded security impairments on non agency mortgage related securities of billion in the loans backing these securities exhibited much worse delinquency behavior as compared to loans in our single family mortgage portfolio  which includes loans we have guaranteed 
the deteriorating market conditions not only contributed to poor performance during  but significantly impacted our expectations regarding future performance  both of which are critical in assessing security impairments 
furthermore  the mortgage related securities backed by subprime loans  alt a and other loans and mta loans  have significantly greater concentrations in the states that are undergoing the greatest economic stress  including california  florida  arizona and nevada 
our non agency mortgage related securities backed by other loans  include securities backed by fha va mortgages  home equity lines of credit and other residential loans 
additionally  during the second half of there were significant negative ratings actions and sustained categorical asset price declines most notably in the mortgage related securities backed by mta loans  which are a type of option arm 
our non agency mortgage related securities backed by subprime and alt a and other loans do not include a significant amount of option arm 
at december  and  our net unrealized losses on mortgage related securities were billion and billion  respectively 
our net unrealized losses related to non agency mortgage related securities backed by mta loans of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we believe that these unrealized losses on non agency mortgage related securities at december  were principally a result of decreased liquidity and larger risk premiums in the non agency mortgage market 
the combination of all of these factors not only had a material  negative impact on our view of expected performance  but also significantly reduced the likelihood of more favorable outcomes  resulting in a substantial increase in other than temporary impairments in due to the rapid deterioration of market conditions discussed above  the uncertainty of future market conditions on our results of operations and the uncertainty surrounding our future business model as a result of our placement into conservatorship  we recorded a billion non cash charge in the second half of in order to establish a partial valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
as a result  at december   we had a remaining deferred tax asset of billion  principally representing the tax effect of unrealized losses on our available for sale securities portfolio

see credit risks mortgage credit risk credit loss performance for further information 
the main contributors to our worsening credit statistics during were single family loans originated in and as well as certain loan groups  such as alt a and interest only mortgage loans 
as of december   loans originated during and represented approximately of the unpaid principal balance of single family loans underlying our pcs and structured securities and of the unpaid principal balance of single family loans on our consolidated balance sheet 
although the credit characteristics of loans underlying our newly issued guarantees during have progressively improved  we have experienced weak credit performance to date from loans purchased in the first half of  which we attribute to the combination of the timeframe of implementation of new loan underwriting requirements  which became effective as our customer contracts permitted  and the poor housing and economic conditions during the year 
sufficient time has not yet elapsed to evaluate the credit performance of loans purchased during the second half of the alt a and interest only loan groups have been particularly adversely affected by certain macroeconomic factors  such as declines in home prices  which have resulted in erosion in the borrower s equity 
our holdings of loans in these groups are concentrated in the west region 
the west region comprised of the unpaid principal balance of our single family mortgage portfolio as of december   but accounted for and of our reo acquisitions  based on property count during and  respectively 
the west region also accounted for approximately and of our credit losses during and  respectively 
alt a loans  which represented approximately of our single family mortgage portfolio as of both december  and  accounted for approximately of our credit losses in compared to during in addition  stressed markets in the west region especially california  arizona and nevada and florida tend to have higher average loan balances than the rest of the us and were more affected by the steep home price declines 
if home prices continue to decline in these and other regions  the credit statistics of our single family mortgage portfolio will continue to deteriorate in as of december   single family mortgage loans in the state of florida comprised approximately of our single family mortgage portfolio  based on unpaid principal balances  however  the loans in this state made up approximately of the total delinquent loans in our single family mortgage portfolio  based on unpaid principal balances 
consequently  florida remains our leading state for seriously delinquent mortgage loans  however  these have been slow to transition to reo and be reflected in our recognized credit losses due to the duration of florida s foreclosure process and our suspension freddie mac 
table of contents of foreclosure sales discussed below 
california and florida were the states where we experienced the highest credit losses during  these states comprised of our single family credit losses on a combined basis 
these and other factors caused us to significantly increase our estimate for loan loss reserves during we have taken several steps during and continuing in designed to support homeowners in the us and mitigate the continued growth of our non performing assets  some of which were undertaken at the direction of fhfa 
we continue to expand our efforts to increase our use of foreclosure alternatives  and have expanded our staff to assist our seller servicers in completing loan modifications and other outreach programs with the objective of keeping more borrowers in their homes 
we expect that many of these efforts will have a negative impact on our financial results 
some of these initiatives during and include approving approximately  workout plans and agreements with borrowers for the estimated  single family loans in our single family mortgage portfolio that were or became delinquent days or more past due or were in foreclosure during  delegating expanded workout authority to our seller servicers and doubling the amount of compensation we provide to seller servicers for successful workouts of delinquent loans  assisting our seller servicers in efforts to reach out to delinquent borrowers earlier and developing programs to do so on a broad scale  in conjunction with fhfa  the hope now alliance and other industry participants  initiating implementation of the streamlined modification program  temporarily suspending all foreclosure sales of occupied homes from november  through january  and from february  through march  to allow for implementation of the streamlined modification program by our seller servicers  and the hasp announced by the obama administration  under which we and our servicers will increase loan modification and refinancing efforts 
we expect our efforts under hasp will replace the streamlined modification program 
beginning march   we will suspend foreclosure sales for those loans that are eligible for modification under the hasp until our servicers determine that the borrower of such a loan is not responsive or that the loan does not qualify for a modification under hasp or any of our other alternatives to foreclosure 
these activities will create fluctuations in our credit statistics 
for example  the suspension of foreclosure sales for occupied homes has temporarily reduced the rate of growth of our reo inventory and credit losses since november  however  this also has created a temporary increase in the number of delinquent loans that remain in our single family mortgage portfolio  which results in higher reported delinquency rates than without our suspension of foreclosures 
in addition  the implementation of the streamlined modification program and the hasp will cause the number of our forbearance agreements  troubled debt restructurings and related losses  such as losses on loans purchased  to rise 
our investments in non agency mortgage related securities  which are primarily backed by subprime  alt a and mta mortgage loans  also were affected by the deteriorating credit conditions during the table below illustrates the increases in delinquency rates for subprime  alt a and mta loans that back the non agency mortgage related securities we own 
given the recent substantial deterioration in the economic outlook and the renewed acceleration of housing price declines  the performance of the loans backing these securities could continue to deteriorate

see consolidated balance sheets analysis mortgage related investments portfolio for further information 
gaap results versus two accounting changes had a significant positive impact on our financial results for our adoptions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  and sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas or the fair value option 
for more information  see critical accounting policies and estimates 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  we changed our method for determining the fair value of our newly issued guarantee obligations 
under sfas  the initial fair value of our guarantee obligation equals the fair value of compensation received  consisting of management and guarantee fees and upfront compensation  in the related securitization transaction  which is a practical expedient for determining fair value 
as a result  prospectively from january   we no longer record estimates of deferred gains or immediate  day one losses on most guarantees 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure certain eligible financial instruments at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value in order to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring assets and liabilities differently 
we initially elected the fair value option for certain available for sale mortgage related securities and our foreign currency denominated debt 
upon adoption of sfas  we recognized a billion after tax increase to our retained earnings accumulated deficit at january  we may continue to elect the fair value option for certain securities to mitigate interest rate aspects of changes in the fair value of our guarantee asset and changes in the fair value of certain pay fixed interest rate swaps 
net loss was billion and billion for and  respectively 
net loss increased during compared to  principally due to an increase in credit related expenses  impairment losses on interest only mortgage securities and certain non agency mortgage related securities  the establishment of a partial valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and increased derivative losses and losses on our guarantee asset 
we refer to the combination of our provision for credit losses and reo operations expense as credit related expenses when we use this term and specifically exclude other market based impairment losses 
these loss and expense items for were partially offset by higher net interest income and higher income on our guarantee obligation as well as lower losses on certain credit guarantees due to our use of the practical expedient for determining fair value under sfas  and lower losses on loans purchased due to changes in our operational practice of purchasing delinquent loans out of pc securitization pools

as a result  we were able to hold higher amounts of fixed rate agency mortgage related securities at significantly wider spreads relative to our funding costs during as compared to our funding costs were lower in  as compared to  due to declines in interest rates combined with our greater use of lower cost short term debt 
net interest income also includes billion of income related to the accretion of other than temporary impairments of investments in available for sale securities recorded in the second and third quarters of non interest income loss was billion and billion for and  respectively 
the increase in non interest loss during was primarily due to higher losses on investment activity  higher derivative losses excluding foreign currency related effects  and higher losses on our guarantee asset driven by increased uncertainty in the market and declines in long term interest rates 
losses on investment activity totaled billion in  as compared to gains of million in  due primarily to impairments on available for sale securities of billion during we believe a significant amount of the declines in fair values represented by these impairments are due to decreased liquidity and larger risk premiums in the mortgage market 
if our assumptions concerning the future performance of these securities are correct  we will recapture a significant portion of these write downs as interest income  as remittances on the securities are received 
we recognized a significant increase in net derivative losses during compared to due to declines in interest rates during  resulting in losses on our pay fixed swap positions  partially offset by gains on receive fixed swaps principally used as economic hedges on our outstanding debt 
these losses were partially offset by increased income on our guarantee obligation and higher management and guarantee income in non interest expense for and totaled billion and billion  respectively  and included credit related expenses of billion and billion  respectively 
excluding credit related expenses  our non interest expense declined from billion in to billion in and was primarily due to the reductions in losses on certain credit guarantees and losses on loans purchased

segment earnings our business operations consist of three reportable segments  which are based on the type of business activities each performs investments  single family guarantee and multifamily 
the activities of our business segments are described in business our business and statutory mission our business segments 
certain activities that are not part of a segment are included in the all other category 
we manage and evaluate performance of the segments and all other using a segment earnings approach  subject to the conduct of our business under the direction of the conservator 
in managing our business  we present the operating performance of our segments using segment earnings 
segment earnings differs significantly from  and should not be used as a substitute for  net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap 
for more information on segment earnings  including its limitations as a measure of our financial performance  see consolidated results of operations segment earnings and note segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements 
the objectives set forth for us under our charter and by our conservator  as well as the restrictions on our business under the purchase agreement with treasury  may negatively impact our segment earnings and the performance of individual segments 
for example the required reduction in our mortgage related investments portfolio balance to billion  through successive annual declines commencing in  will likely cause our investments segment results to decline  our objective of assisting the mortgage market may cause us to change our pricing strategy in our core mortgage loan purchase or guarantee business  which may negatively impact our single family guarantee segment results  and the public policy objective of keeping borrowers in their homes may result in us making substantial concessions to troubled borrowers  which could negatively impact our results 
for more information  see business conservatorship and related developments 
segment earnings is calculated for the segments by adjusting gaap net income loss for certain investment related activities and credit guarantee related activities 
segment earnings includes certain reclassifications among income and expense categories that have no impact on net income loss but provide us with a meaningful metric to assess the performance of each segment and our company as a whole

the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage related investments portfolio increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  contributing to the growth in the portfolio during the second half of was fhfa s directive that we acquire and hold increased amounts of mortgage loans and mortgage related securities in our mortgage portfolio to provide additional liquidity to the mortgage market 
agency securities comprised approximately of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage related investments portfolio at december  versus at december  due to the substantial levels of volatility in worldwide financial markets in  our ability to access both the term and callable debt markets has been limited and we have relied increasingly on the issuance of shorter term debt 
while we use interest rate derivatives to economically hedge a significant portion of our interest rate exposure  we are exposed to risks relating to our ability to issue new debt when our outstanding debt matures and to the variability in interest costs on our new issuances of debt  which directly impacts our investments segment earnings

segment earnings provision for credit losses for the multifamily segment totaled million and million during and  respectively 
we increased our reserve estimates in to reflect the recent deterioration of market conditions  such as unemployment and vacancy rates  which worsened during the second half of and resulted in increased estimated severities of incurred loss 
capital management our entry into conservatorship resulted in significant changes to the assessment of our capital adequacy and our management of capital 
on october   fhfa announced that it was suspending capital classification of us during conservatorship in light of the purchase agreement 
concurrent with this announcement  fhfa classified us as undercapitalized as of june  based on discretionary authority provided by statute 
fhfa has directed us to focus our risk and capital management on  among other things  maintaining a positive balance of gaap stockholders equity in order to reduce the likelihood that we will need to make additional draws on the purchase agreement with treasury  while returning to long term profitability 
however  as discussed in business conservatorship and related developments supervision of our business during conservatorship  certain of the conservator s directives are expected to conflict with these objectives 
the purchase agreement provides that  if fhfa determines as of quarter end that our liabilities have exceeded our assets under gaap  treasury will contribute funds to us in an amount equal to the difference between such liabilities and assets  up to the maximum aggregate amount that may be funded under the purchase agreement 
under the reform act  fhfa must place us into receivership if fhfa determines in writing that our assets are less than our obligations for a period of days 
fhfa has notified us that the measurement period for any mandatory receivership determination with respect to our assets and obligations would commence no earlier than the sec public filing deadline for our quarterly or annual financial statements and would continue for calendar days after that date 
see business regulation and supervision federal housing finance agency receivership for additional information on mandatory receivership 
at december   our liabilities exceeded our assets under gaap by billion while our stockholders equity deficit totaled billion 
accordingly  we must obtain funding from treasury pursuant to its commitment under the purchase agreement in order to avoid being placed into receivership by fhfa

the director of fhfa has submitted a draw request to treasury under the purchase agreement in the amount of billion  which we expect to receive in march as a result of these draws  the aggregate liquidation preference on the senior preferred stock will increase from billion as of september  to billion and the remaining funding available under treasury s announced commitment will decrease to approximately billion 
we expect to make additional draws on treasury s funding commitment in the future 
the size of such draws will be determined by a variety of factors  including whether market conditions continue to deteriorate 
the senior preferred stock accrues quarterly cumulative dividends at a rate of per year or per year in any quarter in which dividends are not paid in cash until all accrued dividends have been paid in cash 
we paid our first quarterly dividend of million in cash on the senior preferred stock on december  at the direction of our conservator 
following receipt of our pending draw  treasury will be entitled to annual cash dividends of billion  as calculated based on the aggregate liquidation preference of billion 
if we make additional draws under the purchase agreement  this would further increase our dividend obligation 
this substantial ongoing dividend obligation  combined with potentially substantial commitment fees payable to treasury starting in and limited flexibility to pay down draws under the purchase agreement  will have an adverse impact on our future financial position and net worth 
for additional information concerning the potential impact of the purchase agreement  including taking additional large draws  see risk factors 
for additional information on our capital management and capital requirements  see liquidity and capital resources capital adequacy and note regulatory capital to our consolidated financial statements 
the purchase agreement places several restrictions on our business activities  which  in turn  affect our management of capital 
for instance  our mortgage related investments portfolio may not exceed billion as of december  and must then decline by per year until it reaches billion 
we are also unable to issue capital stock of any kind without treasury s prior approval  other than in connection with the common stock warrant issued to treasury under the purchase agreement or binding agreements in effect on the date of the purchase agreement 
in addition  on september   the director of fhfa announced the elimination of dividends on our common and preferred stock  excluding the senior preferred stock 
see business conservatorship and related developments for additional information regarding the purchase agreement and the senior preferred stock 
a variety of factors could materially affect the level and volatility of our gaap stockholders equity deficit in future periods and the amount of additional draws we are required to take under the purchase agreement 
key factors include continued deterioration in the housing market  which could increase credit expenses and cause additional other than temporary impairments of our non agency mortgage related securities  the pursuit of policy related objectives that may adversely impact our financial results  adverse changes in interest rates  the yield curve  implied volatility or mortgage oas  which could increase realized and unrealized mark to fair value losses recorded in earnings or aoci  dividend obligations on the senior preferred stock  our inability to access the public debt markets on terms sufficient for our needs  absent support from treasury and the federal reserve  establishment of a valuation allowance for our remaining deferred tax asset  changes in accounting practices or standards  including the initial implementation of proposed amendments to sfas and fin r  potential accounting consequences of our implementation of hasp  or changes in business practices resulting from legislative and regulatory developments  such as the enactment of legislation providing bankruptcy judges with the authority to revise the terms of a mortgage  including the principal amount 
at december   our remaining deferred tax asset  which could be subject to a valuation allowance in future periods  totaled billion 
as a result of the factors described above  it is difficult for us to maintain a positive level of stockholders equity deficit 
liquidity in the second half of  we experienced less demand for our debt securities  as reflected in wider spreads on our term and callable debt 
this reflected overall deterioration in our access to unsecured medium and long term debt markets to fund our purchases of mortgage assets and to refinance maturing debt 
as a result  we have been required to refinance our debt on a more frequent basis  exposing us to an increased risk of insufficient demand and adverse credit market conditions 
we use pay fixed swaps to synthetically create the substantive economic equivalent of various debt funding structures 
thus  if our access to the derivative markets were disrupted  our business results would be adversely affected 
the use of these derivatives also exposes us to additional counterparty credit risk 
this funding strategy may increase the volatility of our gaap results through mark to fair value impacts on our pay fixed swaps and other derivatives 
however  the federal reserve has been an active purchaser of our long term debt under its purchase program as discussed below and spreads on our debt and access to the debt markets have improved in early as a result of this activity 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity for more information on our debt funding activities and risks posed by our current market challenges and risk factors for a discussion of the risks to our business posed by our reliance on the issuance of debt to fund our operations 
freddie mac 
table of contents as described under business conservatorship and related developments  treasury and the federal reserve have taken a number of actions affecting our access to debt financing  including the following treasury entered into the lending agreement with us  under which we may request funds through december  as of december   we had not borrowed against the lending agreement 
the federal reserve has implemented a program to purchase up to billion in direct obligations of freddie mac  fannie mae and the fhlbs 
the federal reserve will purchase these direct obligations from primary dealers 
the federal reserve began purchasing direct obligations under this program in december the support of the federal reserve has helped to improve spreads on our debt and our access to the debt markets 
the lending agreement is scheduled to expire on december  upon expiration  we will not have a substantial liquidity backstop available to us other than treasury s ability to purchase up to billion of our obligations under its permanent authority if we are unable to obtain funding from issuances of debt or other conventional sources 
consequently  our long term liquidity contingency strategy is currently dependent on extension of the lending agreement beyond december  as discussed above  our dividend obligations on the senior preferred stock are substantial  and make it more likely that we will face increasingly negative cash flows from operations 
fair value results our consolidated fair value measurements are a component of our risk management processes  as we use daily estimates of the changes in fair value to calculate our portfolio market value sensitivity  or pmvs  and duration gap measures 
included in our fair value results for are the funds received from treasury of billion under the purchase agreement

during  the fair value of net assets  before capital transactions  decreased by billion compared to a billion decrease during included in the reduction of the fair value of net assets is billion related to our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at fair value during our attribution of changes in the fair value of net assets relies on models  assumptions and other measurement techniques that evolve over time 
the following attribution of changes in fair value reflects our current estimate of the items presented on a pre tax basis and excludes the effect of returns on capital and administrative expenses 
during  our investment activities decreased fair value of net assets by approximately billion 
this estimate includes declines in fair value of approximately billion attributable to the net widening of mortgage to debt oas 
of this amount  approximately billion was related to the impact of the net mortgage to debt oas widening primarily on our portfolio of non agency mortgage related securities with a limited  but increasing amount attributable to the risk of future losses 
the reduction in fair value was partially offset by higher core spread income 
core spread income on our mortgage related investments portfolio is a fair value estimate of the net current period accrual of income from the spread between mortgage related investments and debt  calculated on an option adjusted basis 
during  our investment activities decreased fair value of net assets by approximately billion 
this estimate includes declines in fair value of approximately billion attributable to the net widening of mortgage to debt oas 
of this amount  approximately billion was related to the impact of the net mortgage to debt oas widening on our portfolio of non agency mortgage related securities 
the impact of mortgage to debt oas widening during decreased the current fair value of our investment activities 
due to the relatively wide oas levels for purchases during the period  we believe there is a likelihood that  in future periods  we will be able to recognize core spread income from our investment activities at a higher spread level than historically 
we estimate that at december   we will recognize core spread income at a net mortgage to debt oas level of approximately to basis points in the long run  compared to approximately to basis points estimated at december  as market conditions change  our estimate of expected fair value gains from oas may also change  leading to significantly different fair value results 
during  our credit guarantee activities  including our single family mortgage loan credit exposure  decreased fair value of net assets by an estimated billion 
this estimate includes an increase in the single family guarantee obligation of approximately billion  primarily due to a declining credit environment 
this increase in the single family guarantee obligation includes a reduction of billion in the fair value of our guarantee obligation recorded on january   as a result of our adoption of sfas during  our credit guarantee activities decreased fair value of net assets by an estimated billion

also see critical accounting policies and estimates for more information concerning the most significant accounting policies and estimates applied in determining our reported financial position and results of operations 
effective december   we retrospectively changed our method of accounting for our guarantee obligation a to a policy of no longer extinguishing our guarantee obligation when we purchase all or a portion of our issued pcs and structured securities from a policy of effective extinguishment through the recognition of a participation certificate residual and b to a policy that amortizes our guarantee obligation into earnings in a manner that corresponds more closely to our economic release from risk under our guarantee than our former policy  which amortized our guarantee obligation according to the contractual expiration of our guarantee as observed by the decline in the unpaid principal balance of securitized mortgage loans 
all years results presented herein reflect consistent application of this change

we estimate that the future expected principal and interest shortfall on impaired available for sale securities will be significantly less than the probable impairment loss required to be recorded under gaap  as we expect these shortfalls to be less than the recent fair value declines 
the portion of the impairment charges associated with these expected recoveries is recognized as net interest income in future periods

reflects the accrual of periodic cash settlements of all derivatives in qualifying hedge accounting relationships 
includes imputed interest on zero coupon swaps 
net interest income and net interest yield on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased during compared to primarily due to purchases of fixed rate assets at wider spreads relative to our funding costs  a decrease in funding costs  due to the replacement of higher cost short and long term debt with lower cost debt issuances  and a significant increase in the average size of the mortgage related investments portfolio 
during  liquidity concerns in the market resulted in more favorable investment opportunities for agency mortgage related securities at wider spreads 
fhfa s directive that we acquire and hold increased amounts of mortgage loans and mortgage related securities in our mortgage related investments portfolio to provide additional liquidity to the mortgage market also led to the growth in the portfolio during the second half of in response  we increased our purchase activities resulting in an increase in the average balance of our interest earning assets 
interest income for includes million of income related to the accretion of other than temporary impairments of investments in available for sale securities recorded during the second and third quarters of net interest income and net interest yield for also benefited from funding fixed rate assets with a higher proportion of short term debt in a steep yield curve environment 
however  our use of short term debt funding has also been driven by the substantial levels of volatility in the worldwide financial markets  which has limited our ability to obtain long term and callable debt funding 
during  our short term funding balances increased significantly when compared to we use derivatives to synthetically create the substantive economic equivalent of various debt funding structures 
for example  the combination of a series of short term debt issuances over a defined period and a pay fixed swap with the same maturity as the last debt issuance is the substantive economic equivalent of a long term fixed rate debt instrument of comparable maturity 
however  the use of these derivatives exposes us to additional counterparty credit risk 
see non interest income loss derivative gains losses for additional information about the impact of these pay fixed swaps and other derivatives on our consolidated statements of operations 
the increases in net interest income and net interest yield on a fully taxable equivalent basis during were partially offset by the impact of declining interest rates on our floating rate assets held in our mortgage related investments portfolio during  as well as a decline in prepayment fees  or yield maintenance income  on our multifamily whole loans as a result of a decline in prepayments 
the shift within our cash and other investments portfolio during from higher yielding  longer term non mortgage related securities to lower yielding  shorter term cash and cash equivalent investments  such as commercial paper  in combination with lower short term rates  also partially offset the increase in net interest income and net interest yield 
during  we experienced higher funding costs for our mortgage related investments portfolio as our long term debt interest expense increased  reflecting the replacement of maturing debt that had been issued at lower interest rates with higher cost debt 
the decrease in net interest income and net interest yield on a fully taxable equivalent basis for freddie mac 
table of contents compared to was partially offset by a decrease in our mortgage related securities premium amortization expense as purchases into our mortgage related investments portfolio in largely consisted of securities purchased at a discount 
in addition  wider mortgage to debt oas due to continued lower demand for mortgage related securities from depository institutions and foreign investors  along with heightened market uncertainty regarding mortgage related securities  resulted in favorable investment opportunities during however  to manage to our mandatory target capital surplus then in effect  we reduced our average balance of interest earning assets and as a result  we were not able to take full advantage of these opportunities 
non interest income loss management and guarantee income management and guarantee income primarily consists of contractual management and guarantee fees  representing a portion of the interest collected on loans underlying our pcs and structured securities 
the primary drivers affecting management and guarantee income are changes in the average balance of our issued pcs and structured securities and changes in management and guarantee fee rates for newly issued guarantees 
contractual management and guarantee fees reflect adjustments for buy ups and buy downs  whereby the management and guarantee fee rate is adjusted for up front cash payments we make buy up or receive buy down upon issuance of our guarantee 
our guarantee fee rates are established at issuance and remain fixed over the life of the guarantee 
our average rates of management and guarantee income are affected by the mix of products we issue  competition in the market and customer preference for buy up and buy down fees 
the appointment of fhfa as conservator and the conservator s subsequent directive that we provide increased support to the mortgage market has affected our guarantee pricing decisions by limiting our ability to adjust our fees for current expectations of credit risk  and will likely continue to do so 
table provides summary information about management and guarantee income 
management and guarantee income consists of contractual amounts due to us reflecting buy ups and buy downs to base management and guarantee fees as well as amortization of pre deferred delivery and buy down fees received by us which are recorded as deferred income as a component of other liabilities

management and guarantee income and the related average rates also increased in compared to due to an increase in the amortization of pre deferred fees due to declines in interest rates in to a lesser extent  increased purchases of year fixed rate product during  which has higher guarantee fee rates relative to year fixed rate and certain other products  also contributed to the increase in guarantee fee rates 
management and guarantee income increased in compared to resulting from a increase in the average balance of our issued pcs and structured securities

table of contents the change in fair value of the guarantee asset reflects reductions related to the management and guarantee fees received that are considered a return of our recorded investment on the guarantee asset  and changes in present value of future management and guarantee fees we expect to receive over the life of the related pcs or structured securities 
the changes in fair value of future management and guarantee fees are driven by expected changes in interest rates that affect the estimated life of the mortgages underlying our pcs and structured securities issued and the related discount rates used to determine the net present value of the cash flows 
for example  an increase in interest rates extends the life of the guarantee asset and increases the fair value of future management and guarantee fees 
our valuation methodology for the guarantee asset uses market based information  including market values of excess servicing  interest only securities  to determine the present  or fair value of future cash flows associated with the guarantee asset

a portion of these contractual management and guarantee fees is attributed to imputed interest income on the guarantee asset 
contractual management and guarantee fees increased in both and  primarily due to increases in the average balance of our pcs and structured securities issued and  to a lesser extent  increases in average management and guarantee fee rates 
losses in fair value of management and guarantee fees in were primarily attributed to lower market valuations for excess servicing  interest only securities  which were caused by decreases in interest rates during combined with the effects of a decline in investor demand for mortgage related securities 
gains in fair value of management and guarantee fees in were primarily due to an increase in interest rates 
income on guarantee obligation upon issuance of a guarantee of securitized assets  we record a guarantee obligation on our consolidated balance sheets representing the fair value of our obligation to perform under the terms of the guarantee 
our guarantee obligation is amortized into income using a static effective yield calculated and fixed at inception of the guarantee based on forecasted unpaid principal balances 
the static effective yield is evaluated and adjusted when significant changes in economic events cause a shift in the pattern of our economic release from risk  or the loss curve 
for example  certain market environments may lead to sharp and sustained changes in home prices or prepayments of mortgages  leading to the need for an adjustment in the static effective yield for specific mortgage pools underlying the guarantee 
when a change is required  a cumulative catch up adjustment  which could be significant in a given period  is recognized and a new static effective yield is used to determine our guarantee obligation amortization 
the resulting amortization recorded to income on guarantee obligation results in a pattern of revenue recognition that is more consistent with our economic release from risk under changing economic scenarios and the timing of the recognition of losses on the pools of mortgage loans that we guarantee 
over time  we recognize a provision for credit losses on loans underlying a guarantee contract as those losses are incurred 
those incurred losses may equal  exceed or be less than the expected losses we estimated as a component of our guarantee obligation at inception of the guarantee contract 
effective january   we began estimating the fair value of our newly issued guarantee obligations at their inception using the practical expedient provided by fin  as amended by sfas using this approach  the initial guarantee obligation is recorded at an amount equal to the fair value of the compensation received in the related guarantee transactions  including upfront delivery and other fees 
as a result  we no longer record estimates of deferred gains or immediate day one losses ie  where the fair value of the guarantee obligation at issuance exceeded the fair value of the guarantee and credit enhancement related assets on most guarantees 
all unamortized amounts recorded prior to january  will continue to be deferred and amortized using the static effective yield method 
freddie mac 
table of contents table provides information about the components of income on guarantee obligation 
table income on guarantee obligation year ended december  in millions amortization income related to static effective yield cumulative catch up total income on guarantee obligation amortization income increased for  compared to this increase was due to higher amortization income recognized from guarantee obligation balances associated with issuances  which included significant market risk premiums  including those that resulted in significant day one losses  higher cumulative catch up adjustments during  and higher average balances of our issued pcs and structured securities during the cumulative catch up adjustments recognized during were due to significant declines in home prices 
we estimate that the national decline in home prices  based on our own index of our single family mortgage portfolio  during was approximately as compared to approximately a decline during we believe that there will be a continued decline in home prices during based on our index  and thus we may experience additional cumulative catch up adjustments 
cumulative catch up adjustments during and were principally due to increases in mortgage prepayment speeds attributed to declining interest rates

net deferred gains and losses on closed cash flow hedges ie  where the derivative is either terminated or redesignated are included in aoci  net of taxes  until the related forecasted transaction affects earnings or is determined to be probable of not occurring 
hedge accounting gains losses arise when the fair value change of a derivative does not exactly offset the fair value change of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  and is a component of other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
for further information  see note derivatives to our consolidated financial statements 
for all derivatives in qualifying hedge accounting relationships  the accrual of periodic cash settlements is recorded in net interest income on our consolidated statements of operations and those amounts are not included in the table 
for derivatives not in qualifying hedge accounting relationships  the accrual of periodic cash settlements is recorded in derivative gains losses on our consolidated statements of operations 
in the periods presented prior to  we only elected cash flow hedge accounting relationships for certain commitments to sell mortgage related securities  for which we discontinued hedge accounting in december in the first quarter of  we began designating certain derivative positions as cash flow hedges of changes in cash flows associated freddie mac 
table of contents with our forecasted issuances of debt consistent with our risk management goals 
we expanded this hedge accounting strategy in in an effort to reduce volatility in our consolidated statements of operations 
for a derivative accounted for as a cash flow hedge  changes in fair value are reported in aoci  net of taxes  on our consolidated balance sheets to the extent the hedge is effective 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value is reported as other income on our consolidated statements of operations 
we record changes in the fair value  including periodic settlements  of derivatives not in hedge accounting relationships as derivative gains losses on our consolidated statements of operations 
however  in conjunction with our placement in conservatorship on september   we determined that we could no longer assert that the associated forecasted issuances of debt are probable of occurring and  as a result  we ceased designating derivative positions as cash flow hedges associated with forecasted issuances of debt 
while we can no longer assert that the associated forecasted issuances of debt are probable of occurring  we are also unable to assert that the forecasted issuances of debt are probable of not occurring  therefore the previous deferred amount related to these hedges remain in our aoci balance 
this amount will be recognized into earnings over the expected time period for which the forecasted issuances of debt impact earnings 
any subsequent changes in fair value of those derivative instruments are included in derivative gains losses on our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of this discontinued hedge accounting strategy  we transferred billion in notional amount and million in market value from open cash flow hedges to closed cash flow hedges on september  see note derivatives to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our discontinuation of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
at december  and  the net cumulative change in the fair value of all derivatives designated in cash flow hedge relationships for which the forecasted transactions had not yet affected earnings net of amounts previously reclassified to earnings through each year end was an after tax loss of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
these amounts relate to net deferred losses on closed cash flow hedges 
in addition  due to our establishment of a partial valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets during  net deferred losses of million on our cash flow hedges closed during were not adjusted for tax effects in our aoci balance 
the majority of all closed cash flow hedges relate to hedging the variability of cash flows from forecasted issuances of debt 
fluctuations in prevailing market interest rates have no impact on the deferred portion of aoci  net of taxes  relating to closed cash flow hedges 
the deferred amounts related to closed cash flow hedges will be recognized into earnings as the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings  unless it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur 
if it is probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur  then the deferred amount associated with the forecasted transactions will be recognized immediately in earnings 
at december   over and of the billion net deferred losses in aoci  net of taxes  relating to closed cash flow hedges were linked to forecasted transactions occurring in the next and years  respectively 
over the next years  the forecasted debt issuance needs associated with these hedges range from approximately billion to billion in any one quarter  with an average of billion per quarter 
table presents the scheduled amortization of the net deferred losses in aoci at december  related to closed cash flow hedges 
the scheduled amortization is based on a number of assumptions 
actual amortization will differ from the scheduled amortization  perhaps materially  as we make decisions on debt funding levels or as changes in market conditions occur that differ from these assumptions 
for example  for the scheduled amortization for cash flow hedges related to future debt issuances  we assume that we will not repurchase the related debt and that no other factors affecting debt issuance probabilities will change

includes million loss related to the lehman bankruptcy for the year ended december  for additional information  see credit risks institutional credit risk derivative counterparty credit risk 
includes imputed interest on zero coupon swaps 
we use receive and pay fixed swaps to adjust the interest rate characteristics of our debt funding in order to more closely match changes in the interest rate characteristics of our mortgage assets 
a receive fixed swap results in our receipt of a fixed interest rate payment from our counterparty in exchange for a variable rate payment to our counterparty 
conversely  a pay fixed swap requires us to make a fixed interest rate payment to our counterparty in exchange for a variable rate payment from our counterparty 
receive fixed swaps increase in value and pay fixed swaps decrease in value when interest rates decrease with the opposite being true when interest rates increase 
we use swaptions and other option based derivatives to adjust the characteristics of our debt in response to changes in the expected lives of mortgage related assets in our mortgage related investments portfolio 
purchased call and put swaptions  where we make premium payments  are options for us to enter into receive and pay fixed swaps  respectively 
conversely  written call and put swaptions  where we receive premium payments  are options for our counterparty to enter into receive and pay fixed swaps  respectively 
the fair values of both purchased and written call and put swaptions are sensitive to changes in interest rates and are also driven by the market s expectation of potential changes in future interest rates referred to as implied volatility 
purchased swaptions generally become more valuable as implied volatility increases and less valuable as implied volatility decreases 
recognized losses on purchased options in any given period are limited to the premium paid to purchase the option plus any unrealized gains previously recorded 
potential losses on written options are unlimited 
we also use derivatives to synthetically create the substantive economic equivalent of various debt funding structures 
for example  the combination of a series of short term debt issuances over a defined period and a pay fixed swap with the same maturity as the last debt issuance is the substantive economic equivalent of a long term fixed rate debt instrument of comparable maturity 
similarly  the combination of non callable debt and a call swaption with the same maturity as the non callable debt  is the substantive economic equivalent of callable debt 
however  the use of these derivatives exposes us to additional counterparty credit risk

table of contents recoveries on loans impaired upon purchase recoveries on loans impaired upon purchase represent the recapture into income of previously recognized losses on loans purchased and provision for credit losses associated with purchases of delinquent loans from our pcs and structured securities in conjunction with our guarantee activities 
recoveries occur when a non performing loan is repaid in full or when at the time of foreclosure the estimated fair value of the acquired property  less costs to sell  exceeds the carrying value of the loan 
for impaired loans where the borrower has made required payments that return the loan to less than days delinquent  the recovery amounts are instead recognized as interest income over time as periodic payments are received 
the amount of impaired loans purchased into our mortgage related investments portfolio increased significantly during however  since december  when we changed our practice for optional purchases of delinquent loans  the increase in the carrying balances of these loans has slowed 
see credit risks mortgage credit risk loans purchased under financial guarantees for more information 
during and we recognized recoveries on loans impaired upon purchase of million and million  respectively 
recoveries on impaired loans decreased in compared to because in a greater percentage of loans purchased from pc pools were modified instead of being repaid in full or proceeding to foreclosure 
modifications on delinquent loans can delay the ultimate resolution of losses and consequently extend the timeframe for the recognition of our recoveries 
in addition  the amount of our average recoveries per property on impaired loans began to decline during the second half of due to declining home prices 
our temporary suspension of foreclosures on occupied homes that began during the fourth quarter of also may cause temporary declines in our recoveries in the first half of foreign currency gains losses  net we manage the foreign currency exposure associated with our foreign currency denominated debt through the use of derivatives

professional services expense decreased in compared to as we continued to decrease our reliance on consultants and relied more heavily on our employee base to complete certain financial initiatives and our control remediation activities 
overall  administrative expenses declined in as compared to as we implemented these and other cost reduction measures 
provision for credit losses our reserves for mortgage loan and guarantee losses reflects our best projection of defaults we believe are likely as a result of loss events that have occurred through december  and  respectively 
our reserves also include the impact of our projections of the results of strategic loss mitigation initiatives  including a higher volume of loan modifications for troubled borrowers and projections of recoveries through repurchases by seller servicers of defaulted loans due to failure to follow contractual underwriting requirements at the time of the loan origination 
our reserve estimates also reflect our projections of defaults 
however  the substantial deterioration in the national housing market  the uncertainty in other macroeconomic factors and the uncertainty of the effect of any current or future government actions to address the economic and housing crisis makes forecasting of default rates increasingly imprecise 
an inability to realize the benefits of our loss mitigation plans  a lower realized rate of seller servicer repurchases or default rates that exceed our current projections will cause our losses to be significantly higher than those currently estimated 
the provision for credit losses increased significantly in compared to  as continued weakening in the housing market and a rapid rise in unemployment affected our single family mortgage portfolio 
for more information regarding how we derive our estimate for the provision for credit losses  see critical accounting policies and estimates 
in  and to a lesser extent in  we recorded additional reserves for credit losses on loans within our mortgage related investments portfolio and mortgages underlying our pcs  structured securities and other financial guarantees as a result of increased estimates of incurred losses on both multifamily and single family mortgage loans that are expected to experience higher default rates 
our estimates of incurred losses are higher for single family loans we purchased or guaranteed in certain years  particularly those we purchased during  and to a lesser extent and continued deterioration of macroeconomic factors  such as decreases in home prices and home sales during have negatively impacted our estimates of the severity of loss on a per property basis 
our estimates of incurred loss have also increased  especially for certain product types  such as alt a and interest only mortgage products and for loans on properties in certain states  such as california  florida  nevada and arizona  an observed increase in delinquency rates and the percentage of single family loans that transition from delinquency to foreclosure  with more significant increases concentrated in certain regions of the us and for loans with second lien  third party financing 
for example  as of both december  and  single family mortgage loans in the state of florida comprised approximately of our single family mortgage portfolio  however  the loans in this state made up approximately and  respectively  of the total delinquent loans in our single family mortgage portfolio  based on unpaid principal balances 
similarly  as of both december  and  approximately of loans in our single family mortgage portfolio had second lien  third party financing at origination  however  we freddie mac 
table of contents estimate as of december   that these loans comprise more than of our delinquent loans  based on unpaid principal balances  increases in the average loss per loan  or severity as compared to the prior year 
during  there was a significant increase in the average size of delinquent loans  primarily attributed to the increasing percentage of these loans in the west region  which comprised approximately and of our total delinquent loans in the single family mortgage portfolio as of december  and  respectively  and to a lesser extent  increases in counterparty exposure related to our estimates of recoveries through repurchases by seller servicers of defaulted loans due to failure to follow contractual underwriting requirements at origination and under separate recourse agreements 
during  several of our seller servicers were acquired by the fdic  declared bankruptcy or merged with other institutions 
these and other events increase our counterparty exposure  or the likelihood that we may bear the risk of mortgage credit losses without the benefit of recourse to our counterparty 
see credit risks institutional credit risk for additional information 
we expect our provisions for credit losses to remain high in the likelihood that our credit losses will remain high beyond will depend on a number of factors  including changes in property values  regional economic conditions  the success of our loan modification and other loss mitigation efforts  third party mortgage insurance coverage and recoveries and the realized rate of seller servicer repurchases 
see table credit statistics  single family mortgage portfolio for a presentation of the quarterly trend in the deterioration of our credit statistics  including reo disposition severity 
we may further increase our single family loan loss reserves in future periods if home prices decline further than our expectations or our loss severity estimates increase 
reo operations expense the increase in reo operations expense in  as compared to  was primarily due to a significant increase in our reo property inventory in and declining single family reo property values 
the decline in home prices during and  combined with our higher reo inventory balances  resulted in increased market based write downs of reo  which totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect reo operations expense to increase during  if our single family reo volume continues to rise and home prices continue to decline 
our temporary suspension of foreclosures on occupied homes from november  through january  subsequently extended from february  through march   reduced the growth of reo acquisitions and inventory in december however  the expiration of this suspension will likely result in increased acquisitions of reo properties in beginning march   we will suspend foreclosure sales for those loans that are eligible for modification under the hasp until our servicers determine that the borrower of such a loan is not responsive or that the loan does not qualify for a modification under hasp or any of our other alternatives to foreclosure 
losses on certain credit guarantees losses on certain credit guarantees consist of losses recognized upon the issuance of certain pcs in guarantor swap transactions 
prior to january   our recognition of losses on certain guarantee contracts occurred due to any one or a combination of several factors  including long term contract pricing for our flow business  the difference in overall transaction pricing versus pool level accounting measurements and  less significantly  efforts to support our affordable housing mission 
upon adoption of sfas  our losses on certain credit guarantees in subsequent periods  if any  will generally relate to our efforts to meet our affordable housing goals 
effective january   upon the adoption of sfas  which amended fin  we estimate the fair value of our newly issued guarantee obligations as an amount equal to the fair value of compensation received  inclusive of all rights related to the transaction  in exchange for our guarantee 
as a result  we no longer record estimates of deferred gains or immediate day one losses on most guarantees 
this change had a significant positive impact on our financial results during in  and we recognized losses of million  billion and million  respectively  on certain guarantor transactions entered into during those periods 
the decline in losses on certain guarantees in as compared to was due to the adoption of sfas  discussed above 
increased losses on certain credit guarantees during as compared to  reflect expectations of higher defaults and severity in the credit market in which were not fully offset by increases in guarantee and delivery fees due to competitive pressures and contractual fee arrangements 
losses on loans purchased losses on delinquent and modified loans purchased from the mortgage pools underlying our pcs and structured securities occur when the acquisition basis of the purchased loan exceeds the estimated fair value of the loan on the date of purchase 
effective december  we made certain operational changes for purchasing delinquent loans from pc pools  which significantly reduced the volume of our delinquent loan purchases and consequently the amount of our losses on loans purchased during operationally  we no longer automatically purchase loans from pc pools once they become days freddie mac 
table of contents delinquent  but rather we purchase loans from pools a when the loans are modified  b when foreclosure sales occur  c when the loans have been delinquent for months  or d when the loans are days or more delinquent and when the cost of guarantee payments to pc holders  including advances of interest at the pc coupon  exceeds the expected cost of holding the non performing mortgage in our mortgage related investments portfolio 
our operational changes for purchasing delinquent loans from pc pools did not impact our process or timing of modifying the loans  and thus  have had no effect on the existing loss mitigation alternatives that are available to us or our servicers 
this change in practice does not have an impact on our credit losses  as measured by the amount of charge offs  nor on the cure rates of modified loans 
however  when viewed in isolation  this change in practice results in a higher provision for credit losses associated with our pcs and structured securities and a reduction in our losses on loans purchased 
losses on loans purchased decreased from billion in to billion in due to the decline in the volume of our purchases resulting from the operational changes discussed above 
although the volume of our purchases of delinquent loans declined  the number of loans purchased due to modification increased  particularly in the second half of the implementation of our streamlined modification program beginning in late and the hasp in may result in an increased volume of purchases of loans modified with concessions to the borrower and for which we may recognize significant losses on loans purchased 
the reduction in losses due to the decline in volume of our purchases during was significantly offset by decreases in the fair values of impaired and delinquent loans  which caused higher losses on a per loan basis 
the fair values of impaired and delinquent loans are based on market pricing  which declined throughout  with the most severe declines occurring during the fourth quarter 
we expect to recover a portion of these losses over time since the market based valuations imply losses that are higher than our historical experience 
see recoveries on loans impaired upon purchase for discussion of recoveries on those previously purchased loans 
losses on loans purchased increased from million in to billion in due to the combination of higher volumes of our impaired and delinquent loan purchases during as compared to as well as declines in fair values for these loans 
the total number of loans we purchase from pc pools is dependent on a number of factors  including management decisions about the timing of repurchases  the expected increase in loan delinquencies within our pc pools resulting from the current adverse conditions in the housing market  our temporary suspension of foreclosures discussed above and directives from our conservator  including our recently implemented streamlined modification program and the recently announced hasp 
the credit environment remains fluid  and the number of loans that we purchase from pc pools will continue to be affected by events and conditions that occur nationally and in regional markets  as well as changes in our business practices to respond to the current conditions 
securities administrator loss on investment activity in august  acting as the security administrator for a trust that holds mortgage loan pools backing our pcs  we invested in billion of short term  unsecured loans which we made to lehman on the trust s behalf 
we refer to these transactions as the lehman short term lending transactions 
these transactions were due to mature on september   however  lehman failed to repay these loans and the accrued interest 
on september   lehman filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
to the extent there is a loss related to an eligible investment for the trust  we  as the administrator are responsible for making up that shortfall

segment earnings our business operations consist of three reportable segments  which are based on the type of business activities each performs investments  single family guarantee and multifamily 
the activities of our business segments are described in business our business and statutory mission our business segments and are subject to the direction of the conservator  as discussed in business conservatorship and related developments managing our business during conservatorship 
certain activities that are not part of a segment are included in the all other category  this category freddie mac 
table of contents consists of certain unallocated corporate items  such as costs associated with remediating our internal controls and near term restructuring costs  costs related to the resolution of certain legal matters and certain income tax items 
we manage and evaluate performance of the segments and all other using a segment earnings approach  subject to the conduct of our business under the direction of the conservator 
we expect our pursuit of public policy objectives at the direction of the conservator will  in many cases  have a negative impact on the financial results of our segments 
in managing our business  we present the operating performance of our segments using segment earnings 
segment earnings differs significantly from  and should not be used as a substitute for  net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap 
there are important limitations to using segment earnings as a measure of our financial performance 
among them  the need to obtain funding under the purchase agreement is based on our gaap results  as are our regulatory capital requirements which are suspended during conservatorship 
segment earnings adjusts for the effects of certain gains and losses and mark to fair value items  which  depending on market circumstances  can significantly affect  positively or negatively  our gaap results and which  in recent periods  have contributed to our significant gaap net losses 
gaap net losses will adversely impact our gaap stockholders equity deficit  as well as our need for funding under the purchase agreement  regardless of results reflected in segment earnings 
also  our definition of segment earnings may differ from similar measures used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of segment earnings highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying results of the segments in a manner that is useful to the way we manage and evaluate the performance of our business 
segment earnings presents our results on an accrual basis as the cash flows from our segments are earned over time 
the objective of segment earnings is to present our results in a manner more consistent with our business models 
the business model for our investment activity is one where we generally buy and hold our investments in mortgage related assets for the long term  fund our investments with debt and use derivatives to minimize interest rate risk 
the business model for our credit guarantee activity is one where we are a long term guarantor in the conforming mortgage markets  manage credit risk and generate guarantee and credit fees  net of incurred credit losses 
we believe it is meaningful to measure the performance of our investment and guarantee businesses using long term returns  not short term value 
as a result of these business models  we believe that this accrual based metric is a meaningful way to present our results as actual cash flows are realized  net of credit losses and impairments 
we believe segment earnings provides us with a view of our financial results that is more consistent with our business objectives and helps us better evaluate the performance of our business  both from period to period and over the longer term 
segment earnings is calculated for the segments by adjusting gaap net income loss for certain investment related activities and credit guarantee related activities 
segment earnings includes certain reclassifications among income and expense categories that have no impact on net income loss but provide us with a meaningful metric to assess the performance of each segment and our company as a whole 
we continue to assess the methodologies used for segment reporting and refinements may be made in future periods 
see note segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our segments and the adjustments and reclassifications used to calculate segment earnings  as well as the management reporting and allocation process used to generate our segment results 
segment earnings results investments our investments business is responsible for investment activity in mortgages and mortgage related securities  other investments  debt financing  and managing our interest rate risk  liquidity and capital positions 
we invest principally in mortgage related securities and single family mortgages through our mortgage related investments portfolio

in contrast  non credit related security impairments of billion are included in our gaap results but are not included in segment earnings 
segment earnings non interest expense for includes a loss of billion related to the lehman short term lending transactions 
segment earnings net interest income increased million and segment earnings net interest yield increased basis points to basis points for compared to the increases in segment earnings net interest income and segment earnings net interest yield were primarily due to purchases of fixed rate assets at wider spreads relative to our funding costs  decreased funding costs due to the replacement of higher cost short and long term debt with lower cost debt issuances  and growth in the mortgage related investments portfolio 
partially offsetting these increases in segment earnings net interest income and segment earnings net interest yield were the impact of declining rates on our floating rate assets as well as an increase in derivative interest carry expense on net pay fixed swaps as a result of decreased interest rates and higher notional balances resulting from higher issuances of shorter term debt 
we use derivatives to synthetically create the substantive economic equivalent of various debt funding structures 
for example  the combination of a series of short term debt issuances over a defined period and a pay fixed swap with the same maturity as the last debt issuance is the substantive economic equivalent of a long term fixed rate debt instrument of comparable maturity 
however  the use of these derivatives exposes us to additional counterparty credit risk 
in  the growth rate of our mortgage related investments portfolio was compared to for the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage related investments portfolio increased from billion at december  to billion at december  the overall increase in the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage related investments portfolio was primarily due to more favorable investment opportunities for agency securities  due to liquidity concerns in the market  during the portfolio also grew in the second half of due to fhfa s directive that we acquire and hold freddie mac 
table of contents increased amounts of mortgage loans and mortgage related securities in our mortgage related investments portfolio to provide additional liquidity to the mortgage market 
due to the substantial levels of volatility in the worldwide financial markets in  our ability to access both the term and callable debt markets has been limited and we have relied increasingly on the issuance of shorter term debt 
therefore  we are exposed to risks relating to both our ability to issue new debt when our outstanding debt matures and to the variability in interest costs on our new issuances of debt that directly impacts our investments segment earnings 
we held billion of non freddie mac agency mortgage related securities and billion of non agency mortgage related securities as of december  compared to billion of non freddie mac agency mortgage related securities and billion of non agency mortgage related securities as of december  the decline in the unpaid principal balance of non agency mortgage related securities is due to the receipt of monthly principal repayments on these securities 
see consolidated balance sheets analysis mortgage related investments portfolio for additional information regarding our mortgage related securities 
the objectives set forth for us under our charter and conservatorship may negatively impact our investments segment results over the long term 
for example  the planned reduction in our mortgage related investments portfolio balance to billion  through successive annual declines commencing in  will cause a corresponding reduction in our net interest income 
this may cause our investments segment results to decline 
however  at the conservator s direction  we increased the size of our mortgage related investments portfolio to provide additional liquidity to the mortgage market  which has caused our investments segment net interest income to increase 
segment earnings for our investments segment declined slightly in compared to in and  the growth rates of our mortgage related investments portfolio were and  respectively 
in  wider mortgage to debt oas resulted in favorable investment opportunities  particularly in the second half of the year 
in response to these market conditions  we increased our purchases of cmbs and agency mortgage related securities 
in november  additional widening in oas levels negatively impacted our gaap results and lowered our overall capital position 
capital constraints forced us to reduce our balance of interest earning assets  issue billion of non cumulative  perpetual preferred stock and reduce our common stock dividend by in the fourth quarter of as a result  the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage related investments portfolio increased only slightly from billion at december  to billion at december  in addition  we began managing our mortgage related investments portfolio under a voluntary  temporary growth limit during the second half of our net interest yield remained unchanged for compared to  however  our investments segment net interest income declined 
this decline was due  in part  to a decrease in the average balance of our investments segment s mortgage related investments portfolio 
we also experienced higher funding costs as our long term debt interest expense increased  reflecting the replacement of maturing debt that we issued at lower interest rates during the past few years with more expensive debt 
increases in our funding costs were offset by a decline in our mortgage related securities amortization expense as purchases in largely consisted of securities purchased at a discount 
single family guarantee in this segment  we guarantee the payment of principal and interest on single family mortgage related securities  including those held in our mortgage related investments portfolio  in exchange for monthly management and guarantee fees and other up front compensation 
earnings for this segment consist primarily of management and guarantee fee revenues less the related credit costs ie  provision for credit losses and operating expenses 
earnings for this segment also include the interest earned on assets held in the investments segment related to single family guarantee activities  net of allocated funding costs and amounts related to expected net float benefits 
expected net float benefit consists of estimates of float  net of our cost of funding advances  and compensating interest 
float is the income earned from the temporary investment of cash payments received from loan servicers for borrower payments and prepayments in advance of the date that payments are due to pc holders 
the cost of funding advances arises in situations where we are required to pay pc holders prior to receiving cash from the loan servicers 
when a borrower prepays the loan balance  interest is only due up to the date of the prepayment  however  the holder of the pc is entitled to interest for the entire month 
we make payments to the pc holders for this shortfall  which we refer to as compensating interest 
we record our estimate of expected net float benefit in the single family guarantee segment and the difference between expectations and actual results is reflected in segment earnings for our investments segment

segment earnings loss for our single family guarantee segment declined to a loss of billion in compared to a loss of million for the decline reflects an increase in credit related expenses due to higher delinquency rates  higher volumes of non performing loans and foreclosures  higher severity of losses on a per property basis and a decline in home prices and other regional economic conditions 
the decline in segment earnings during was partially offset by an increase in segment earnings management and guarantee income as compared to  which is primarily due to higher average balances of the single family credit guarantee portfolio during  an increase in the average fee rates shown in the table below and higher upfront fee amortization

our single family mortgage purchase and guarantee volumes are impacted by several factors  including origination volumes  mortgage product and underwriting trends  competition  customer specific behavior and contract terms 
mortgage purchase volumes from individual customers can fluctuate significantly 
mortgage originators significantly tightened their credit standards during in response to market conditions  causing conforming  fixed rate mortgages to be the predominant product during we also made significant changes to our underwriting standards in which we expect will reduce our credit risk exposure for new business 
as a result  there has been a shift in the composition of our new issuances during to a greater proportion of higher quality  fixed rate mortgages and a reduction in our guarantee of interest only and alt a mortgage loans 
for example  alt a loans made up approximately and of our mortgage purchase volume during and  respectively  however  alt a loans made up approximately billion or of our single family mortgage purchase volume during in october  we announced that  on and after march   we will no longer purchase mortgages originated in reliance on reduced documentation of income and assets and mortgages to borrowers with credit scores below a specified minimum 
see credit risks mortgage credit risk underwriting requirements and quality control standards for further information 
during  we implemented certain increases in delivery fees  which are paid at the time of securitization 
upfront fees are recognized in segment earnings management and guarantee fee income rather than as part of income on guarantee obligation under gaap 
for more information on our changes in underwriting requirements and delivery fees as well as their effect on the composition of our single family credit guarantee portfolio  see credit risks mortgage credit risk 
the appointment of fhfa as conservator and the conservator s directive that we provide increased support to the mortgage market has affected our guarantee pricing decisions and will likely continue to do so 
net interest income in this segment decreased in compared to  due to our december change to record trust management fees within single family guarantee other non interest income  whereas previously the expected net float benefits were recorded in single family guarantee net interest income 
in addition  single family guarantee trust management fees  included in other non interest income  were negatively impacted by declines in interest rates during  which resulted in lower income on interest earning assets of the trust 
our segment earnings provision for credit losses for the single family guarantee segment increased to billion in  compared to billion in  due to continued credit deterioration in our single family credit guarantee portfolio  primarily related to and loan purchases 
mortgages in our portfolio originated in and have had higher delinquency rates as well as higher loss severities on a per property basis 
our provision is based on our estimate of incurred credit losses inherent in both our mortgage loan and our single family credit guarantee portfolio using recent historical performance  such as the trends in delinquency rates  recent charge off experience  recoveries from credit enhancements and other loss mitigation activities 
our segment earnings provision for loan loss is generally higher than amounts recorded under gaap due to the inclusion of foregone interest income on impaired loans and additional provision expense related to freddie mac 
table of contents loans purchased under our financial guarantees  which are recognized in different line items in our gaap statements of operations 
the delinquency rate on our single family credit guarantee portfolio  representing those loans which are days or more past due and excluding loans underlying structured transactions  increased to basis points as of december  from basis points as of december  increases in delinquency rates occurred in all product types in  but were most significant for interest only and alt a mortgages 
see credit risks table single family delinquency rates by product for further information 
charge offs  gross  for this segment increased to billion in compared to billion in  primarily due to a considerable increase in the volume of reo properties acquired at foreclosure 
declining home prices resulted in higher charge offs  on a per property basis  during  and we expect increases in charge offs to continue in single family guarantee reo operations expense significantly increased for both and compared to the prior year 
the impact of the weak housing market was first evident during in areas of the country where unemployment rates have been relatively high  such as the north central region 
however  during  we experienced significant increases in delinquency rates and reo activity in all other regions of the us  particularly in the states of california  florida  nevada and arizona 
the west region represented approximately of our reo property acquisitions during  based on the number of units 
the highest concentration in the west region is in the state of california 
at december   our reo inventory in california represented approximately of our total reo property inventory  based on loan amount prior to acquisition 
california has accounted for an increasing amount of our credit losses and losses on our loans in this state comprised approximately of our total credit losses in in november  we announced a suspension of foreclosure sales on occupied homes  which remained in effect until january   and was renewed from february  through march   as well as a suspension of evictions on reo properties  which will remain in effect until april  in part  this was done to allow us to implement the streamlined modification program  which we began to implement in december this program and the recently announced hasp are designed to assist delinquent borrowers meeting certain criteria by offering loan modifications and potentially avoiding foreclosure 
as a result of our suspension of foreclosures  we experienced an increase in single family delinquency rates and a decrease in credit losses and reo acquisitions and inventory during december see credit risks mortgage credit risk loss mitigation activities for further information on this program and our more recent foreclosure suspensions  as well as potential impacts to our results 
declines in home prices have contributed to the increase in the weighted average estimated current ltv ratio for loans underlying our single family credit guarantee portfolio to at december  from at december  approximately of loans in our single family credit guarantee portfolio had estimated current ltv ratios above  excluding second liens by third parties  at december   compared to at december  in general  higher total ltv ratios indicate that the borrower has less equity in the home and would thus be more susceptible to foreclosure in the event of a financial downturn 
we expect that home prices will continue to decline during  and will result in increased current estimated ltv ratios on loans in our single family credit guarantee portfolio 
we expect that declines in home prices combined with the deterioration in rates of unemployment and other factors will result in higher credit losses for our single family guarantee segment during multifamily through our multifamily segment  we purchase multifamily mortgages for investment and guarantee the payment of principal and interest on multifamily mortgage related securities and mortgages underlying multifamily housing revenue bonds 
the mortgage loans of the multifamily segment consist of mortgages that are secured by properties with five or more residential rental units 
multifamily loans are typically large  customized  non homogenous loans that are not as conducive to securitization as single family loans and the market for multifamily securitizations is currently relatively illiquid 
accordingly  we typically hold multifamily loans for investment purposes 
in  we began holding multifamily mortgages designated held for sale as part of our initiative to offer securitization capabilities to the market and our customers 
we plan to increase our securitization activity of multifamily loans we hold in our portfolio during  as market conditions permit 
our multifamily segment also includes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor low and moderate income multifamily rental apartments  which benefit from lihtc 
these activities support our mission to supply financing for affordable rental housing 
also included is the interest earned on assets held in our investments segment related to multifamily activities  net of allocated funding costs

segment earnings for our multifamily segment decreased  to million for compared to million for  primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses  which was partially offset by higher lihtc partnership tax benefits 
we also recognized higher management and guarantee fee income during due to higher average balances of our multifamily guarantee portfolio during segment earnings for our multifamily segment decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to lower net interest income and a higher provision for credit losses 
net interest income for this segment primarily reflects interest on our multifamily loan portfolio balance  however it also includes interest earned on cash and other investment balances held in the investments segment related to multifamily activities  net of allocated funding costs 
the net interest income of this segment was unchanged in  compared to however  we benefited from higher expected rates of return on new purchases  coupled with a higher average balance in the multifamily loan portfolio that was offset by lower yield maintenance fees in loan purchases into the multifamily loan and guarantee portfolios on a combined basis were billion for  an increase compared to as we continued to provide stability and liquidity for the financing of rental housing nationwide 
non interest loss declined to million in from million in  due to an increase in management and guarantee income and  to a lesser extent  an increase in bond application fees during compared to the multifamily mortgage market differs from the residential single family market in several respects 
the likelihood that a multifamily borrower will make scheduled payments on its mortgage is a function of a property s cash flow  which is determined by the ability of the property to generate income sufficient to make those payments  and is affected by rent levels  vacancy rates and operating expenses of the borrower 
strength in the multifamily market therefore is affected by the balance between the supply of  and demand for  rental housing both multifamily and single family  which in turn is affected by unemployment rates  the number of new units added to the rental housing supply  rates of household formation freddie mac 
table of contents and the relative cost of owner occupied housing alternatives 
apartment market fundamentals began to deteriorate in the second half of  due to increased vacancy rates  declining rent levels and a weakening employment market in the us given the significant weakness currently being experienced in the us economy  it is likely that apartment fundamentals in the us will continue to deteriorate during which could cause us to provide for additional credit losses 
multifamily capital market conditions also deteriorated significantly in the second half of  with a dramatic decline in available credit and more strict underwriting requirements by investors 
as a result  the multifamily market slowed during  which reduced institutional investor activity and resulted in significantly lower lending activity for both construction and refinancing 
as a result of the continuing weakness in the apartment and capital markets  we expect industry wide loan demand in to decline by an additional to from levels 
we continued to be very active in the multifamily market in and  by our purchase or guarantee of new loans totaling approximately billion and billion  respectively 
our continued high level of purchase and guarantee activity during  despite declining industry fundamentals  reflects our acknowledged priority to continue providing support for the us mortgage market during this period of uncertainty  and our ability to adjust our underwriting standards and pricing to reflect the heightened level of risk 
our multifamily segment provision for credit losses increased to million in from million in to determine our estimate for incurred losses on our multifamily loan and guarantee portfolios  we evaluate each property based on available financial or operational results and also incorporate available economic data to update these results and evaluate the severity of expected losses 
although we use the most recently available results of our multifamily borrowers to assess our estimate of reserves  there is a lag in reporting as they prepare their results in the normal course of business 
consequently  our reserve estimate for reflects our best judgment of the severity associated with our probable incurred losses and reflects deterioration in recent market conditions  particularly increases in unemployment rates  higher vacancy rates and declines in average monthly rental rates during the second half of we acquired three reo properties during the fourth quarter of  bringing our total multifamily reo inventory to six properties at december  we increased our reserve estimates in to reflect the recent deterioration in market conditions  particularly in the fourth quarter  which resulted in increased estimates of severities of incurred loss 
there were no purchases or sales of lihtc investments in tax benefits for lihtc partnerships increased to million in from million in tax benefits from lihtc partnerships are recognized in our multifamily segment earnings regardless of the ability to claim or use them at the corporate level

table of contents the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage related investments portfolio increased by billion to billion at december  compared to december  the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage related securities held in our mortgage related investments portfolio increased by billion during the overall increase in the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage related investments portfolio was primarily due to more favorable investment opportunities for agency securities given a broad market decline driven by a lack of liquidity in the market during in response  our net purchase activity increased considerably as we deployed capital at favorable oas levels 
the portfolio also grew in the second half of due to fhfa s directive that we acquire and hold increased amounts of mortgage loans and mortgage related securities in our mortgage related investments portfolio to provide additional liquidity to the mortgage market 
although our pcs and structured securities and agency mortgage related securities balances increased billion during the year  this was partially offset by decreases in non agency mortgage related securities balances 
non agency mortgage related securities decreased billion primarily due to principal repayments on securities backed by subprime loans  alt a and other loans and mta loans 
as of march   the voluntary growth limit on our mortgage related investments portfolio expired 
additionally  our mandatory target capital surplus was reduced by fhfa to from above our statutory minimum capital requirement on march  this surplus requirement has not been in effect since the suspension of our regulatory capital requirements by the conservator on october  the balance of mortgage loans increased by billion during we invest primarily in multifamily loans on fully developed apartment complexes with institutional customers 
these loans include both adjustable and fixed rates 
fixed rate loans generally include prepayment fees if the borrowers prepay within the yield maintenance period  which is normally the initial five to ten years 
we have grown both the adjustable and fixed rate portfolios considerably during due to attractive purchase opportunities 
while industry wide loan demand is expected to decline in  we expect continued growth in our multifamily loan portfolio during  but not as robust as as mortgage interest rates declined late in the second half of  single family refinance mortgage originations increased and the volume of deliveries of single family mortgage loans to us for cash purchase rather than for guarantor swap transactions also increased 
we provide liquidity to our seller servicers through our cash purchase program 
loans purchased through the cash purchase program are typically sold to investors through a cash auction of pcs  and  in the interim  are carried as mortgage loans on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  because of continuing market disruptions in the second half of  demand for our cash auctions of pcs has decreased and we sold fewer pcs in cash auctions 
our increased cash purchase activity coupled with fewer pcs sold at cash auctions  as well as our increased purchases of nonperforming loans from the mortgage pools underlying our pcs and structured securities  resulted in a higher balance of single family mortgage loans at december  than at december  higher risk components of our mortgage related investments portfolio our mortgage related investments portfolio includes mortgage loans with higher risk characteristics and mortgage related securities backed by subprime loans  alt a and other loans and mta loans 
higher risk single family mortgage loans we generally do not classify our investments in single family mortgage loans within our mortgage related investments portfolio as either prime or subprime  however  we recognize that there are mortgage loans within our mortgage related investments portfolio with higher risk characteristics 
for example  we estimate that there were billion and billion at december  and december   respectively  of loans with original ltv ratios greater than and credit scores  based on the rating system developed by fair  isaac and co  inc  or fico  less than at the time of loan origination 
in addition  we estimate that approximately billion and billion of security collateral underlying our structured transactions at december  and  respectively  were classified as subprime  based on our classification that they are also higher risk loan types 
many mortgage market participants classify single family loans with credit characteristics that range between their prime and subprime categories as alt a 
although there is no universally accepted definition of alt a  industry participants have used this classification principally to describe loans for which the underwriting process has been streamlined in order to reduce the documentation requirements of the borrower or allow alternative documentation 
in determining our alt a exposure in loans underlying our single family mortgage portfolio  we have classified mortgage loans as alt a if the lender that delivers them to us has classified the loans as alt a  or if the loans had reduced documentation requirements  which indicate that the loan should be classified as alt a 
we estimate that approximately billion  or  of loans underlying our single family pcs and structured securities at december  were classified as alt a mortgage loans 
in addition  we estimate that approximately billion  or approximately  of our investments in single family mortgage loans in our mortgage related investments portfolio were classified as alt a loans at december  see credit risks mortgage credit risk for further information 
freddie mac 
table of contents non agency mortgage related securities backed by subprime loans participants in the mortgage market often characterize single family loans based upon their overall credit quality at the time of origination  generally considering them to be prime or subprime 
there is no universally accepted definition of subprime 
the subprime segment of the mortgage market primarily serves borrowers with poorer credit payment histories and such loans typically have a mix of credit characteristics that indicate a higher likelihood of default and higher loss severities than prime loans 
such characteristics might include a combination of high ltv ratios  low credit scores or originations using lower underwriting standards such as limited or no documentation of a borrower s income 
at december  and  we held investments of billion and billion  respectively  of non agency mortgage related securities backed by subprime loans in our mortgage related investments portfolio 
during  we did not buy or sell any of these securities 
in addition to the contractual interest payments  we received monthly remittances of principal repayments on these securities  which totaled billion during  representing a partial return of our investment in these securities 
we have seen a decrease in the annualized rate of principal repayments during  from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of these securities include significant credit enhancement  particularly through subordination 
of these securities  and were investment grade at december  and  respectively 
we recognized impairment losses on these securities of billion during the unrealized losses  net of tax  on these securities are included in aoci and totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the declines in fair values for these securities are mainly attributable to poor underlying collateral performance  decreased liquidity and larger risk premiums in the mortgage market 
non agency mortgage related securities backed by alt a and other loans as noted above  we have classified securities as alt a if the securities were labeled as alt a when sold to us or if we believe the underlying collateral includes a significant amount of alt a loans

non agency mortgage related securities backed by mta loans mta adjustable rate mortgages which are a type of option arm are indexed to the moving treasury average  have adjustable interest rates and optional payment terms  including options that allow for deferral of principal payments and result in negative amortization for an initial period of years 
mta loans generally have a specified date when the mortgage is recast to require principal payments under new terms  which can result in substantial increases in monthly payments by the borrower 
we classified these securities as mta if the securities were labeled as mta when sold to us or if we believe the underlying collateral includes a significant amount of mta loans 
we had billion and billion of non agency mortgage related securities classified as mta at december  and  respectively 
with the exception of million of unpaid principal balance purchased in january  we did not buy or sell any of these securities during in addition to the contractual interest payments  we received monthly remittances of principal repayments on these securities  which totaled billion during  representing a partial return of our investment in these securities

table of contents at december   our gross unrealized losses on available for sale mortgage related securities were billion 
the main components of these losses are gross unrealized losses of billion related to non agency mortgage related securities backed by subprime loans  alt a and other loans and mta loans and commercial mortgage backed securities 
we believe that these unrealized losses on non agency mortgage related securities at december  were principally a result of decreased liquidity and larger risk premiums in the non agency mortgage market 
all securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated to determine if the impairment is other than temporary 
the evaluation of these securities considers available information  including analyses based on loss severity  default  prepayment and other borrower behavior assumptions 
other than temporary impairments table summarizes our impairments on our mortgage related securities recorded by security type and the duration of the unrealized loss prior to impairment of less than months and months or greater

during the fourth quarter of  of the billion in non agency mortgage related securities in our available for sale portfolio at december   we have identified securities primarily backed by subprime loans  alt a and other loans and mta loans with billion of unpaid principal balance that are probable of incurring a contractual principal or interest loss 
this probable loss is due to significant recent sustained deterioration in the performance of the underlying collateral of these securities and lack of confidence in the credit enhancements provided by three monoline insurers 
we have determined that it is both probable a principal and interest shortfall will occur on the insured securities and that in such a case  there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the insurer s ability to pay all future claims 
as such  we recognized impairment losses on non agency mortgage related securities of billion during the fourth quarter of  which were determined to be other than temporary 
the recent deterioration has not impacted our ability and intent to hold these securities 
we estimate that the future expected principal and interest shortfall on these securities will be significantly less than the impairment loss recognized under gaap  as we expect these shortfalls to be less than the recent fair value declines 
our estimates of expected losses increased during the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 
the portion of the impairment charges associated with expected recoveries that we estimate may be recognized as net interest income in future periods was billion as of december  the deterioration in the mortgage market and resulting illiquidity has caused the government to take unprecedented action during the second half of the decline in mortgage credit performance has been most severe for subprime loans  alt a and other loans and mta loans 
many of the same global economic factors impacting the performance of our guarantee portfolio led to a considerably more pessimistic outlook for the performance of our mortgage related securities in our mortgage related investments portfolio 
rising unemployment  accelerating home price declines  tight credit conditions  freddie mac 
table of contents volatility in mortgage rates and libor  and weakening consumer confidence not only contributed to poor performance during the year but significantly impacted our expectations regarding future performance  both of which are critical in assessing other than temporary impairments 
furthermore  the subprime loans  alt a and other loans and mta loans backing our securities have significantly greater concentrations in the states that are undergoing the greatest economic stress  such as california  florida  arizona and nevada 
our securities backed by and first lien subprime loans accounted for billion of the impaired unpaid principal balance and billion of other than temporary impairment expense during the fourth quarter of as with the other asset classes  a key determinant in our conclusion that impairments were other than temporary was the considerable deterioration of economic conditions and the housing market during the fourth quarter of which adversely impacted our view of future performance 
delinquencies on the and subprime loans backing these securities increased by and  respectively 
our securities backed by alt a loans and other loans accounted for billion of the impaired unpaid principal balance and billion of other than temporary impairment expense during the fourth quarter of  with approximately of such amounts coming from loans originated in and the loans backing these securities experienced increases in delinquencies  material price declines  ratings actions  and deteriorating expectations concerning future performance 
our securities backed by mta loans accounted for billion of the impaired unpaid principal balance and billion of other than temporary impairment expense during the fourth quarter delinquencies on and vintage mta loans increased and  respectively  during the fourth quarter of securities backed by mta loans experienced sustained price declines  with prices for this category  on average  falling by approximately in the fourth quarter of the mta sector also experienced continued downgrades during the quarter  with only of our securities rated aaa as of december   versus at the end of the third quarter 
during and  we recorded other than temporary impairments related to investments in mortgage related securities of billion and million  respectively 
the other than temporary impairments recognized during related primarily to non agency securities backed by subprime loans  alt a and other loans and mta loans  due to the combination of a more pessimistic view of future performance due to the economic environment and poor performance of the collateral underlying these securities 
the impairments also relate to credit enhancements provided by primary monoline bond insurance from three monoline insurers on individual securities in an unrealized loss position  as we have determined that it is both probable a principal and interest shortfall will occur on the insured securities and that in such a case  there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the insurer s ability to pay all future claims 
in the case of monoline insurers  we considered our own analysis as well as additional qualitative factors  such as the ability of each monoline to access capital and to generate new business  pending regulatory actions  ratings  security prices and credit default swap levels traded on the insurers 
while it is possible that under certain conditions  defaults and severity of losses on our remaining available for sale securities for which we have not recorded an impairment charge could exceed our subordination and credit enhancement levels and a principal or interest loss could occur  we do not believe that those conditions were probable at december  based on our ability and intent to hold our remaining available for sale securities for a sufficient time to recover all unrealized losses and our consideration of available information  we have concluded that the reduction in fair value of these securities was temporary at december  see note investments in securities to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on how we evaluate our available for sale portfolio for other than temporary impairment 
for the securities where we determined that the impairment was other than temporary  we estimate that the future expected principal and interest shortfall will be significantly less than the probable impairment loss required to be recorded under gaap  as we expect these shortfalls to be less than the recent fair value declines 
we recognized impairment losses during on securities primarily backed by subprime  alt a and other loans and mta loans of billion 
the portion of these impairment charges associated with expected recoveries that we estimate may be recognized as net interest income in future periods was billion on securities backed primarily by subprime  alt a and other and mta loans as of december  this reflects a reduction in the estimate of future recoveries of prior quarter impairment charges of billion as of december  our assessments concerning other than temporary impairment and accretion of impairment charges require significant judgment and are subject to change as the performance of the individual securities changes  mortgage conditions evolve and our assessments of future performance are updated 
bankruptcy reform  loan modification programs and other government intervention can significantly change the performance of the underlying loans and thus our securities 
current market conditions are unprecedented  in our experience  and actual results could differ materially from our expectations 
freddie mac 
table of contents furthermore  different market participants could arrive at materially different conclusions regarding the likelihood of various default and severity outcomes  and these differences tend to be magnified for nontraditional products such as mta loans 
hypothetical scenarios on our investments in non agency mortgage related securities we present hypothetical scenarios based on the key assumptions in our analyses designed to simulate the distribution of cash flows from the underlying loans to the securities that we hold considering different default rate and severity assumptions 
in preparing each scenario  we use numerous assumptions in addition to the default rate and severity assumptions  including  but not limited to  the timing of losses  prepayment rates  the collectability of excess interest and interest rates that could materially impact the results 
since we do not use this analysis for determination of our reported results under gaap  this analysis is hypothetical and may not be indicative of our actual results 
tables provide the summary results of the default rate and severity hypothetical scenarios for our investments in available for sale non agency mortgage related securities backed by first lien subprime  alt a and mta loans at december  in previous quarters we divided the portfolios into delinquency quartiles and ran more stressful default rates on the quartiles with the highest levels of current delinquencies 
in light of increasing uncertainty concerning default rates and severity due to the overall deterioration in the economy and the impact of loan modifications  pending bankruptcy reform legislation and other government intervention on the loans underlying our securities  we increased the number of default and severity scenarios to reflect a broader range of possible outcomes 
while the more stressful scenarios are beyond what we currently believe are probable  these tables give insight into the potential economic losses under hypothetical scenarios 
in addition to the hypothetical scenarios  these tables also display underlying collateral performance and credit enhancement statistics  by vintage and quartile of delinquency 
within each of these quartiles  there is a distribution of both credit enhancement levels and delinquency performance  and individual security performance will differ from the quartile as a whole 
furthermore  some individual securities with lower subordination could have higher delinquencies 
the projected economic losses presented for each hypothetical scenario represent the present value of possible cash shortfalls given the related assumptions 
in past quarters we have included the present value of both the principal and interest shortfalls 
however  we do not believe that the interest shortfalls are representative of our risk of economic loss as these amounts represent returns on our investment versus returns of our investment 
as such  the projected economic losses include the present value of potential principal shortfalls only 
additionally  some of these securities are not subject to principal write downs until their legal final maturity  which leads to a smaller present value loss than on a security that could take principal write downs earlier 
however  these amounts do not represent the other than temporary impairment charge that would result under the given scenario 
any other than temporary impairment charges would vary depending on the fair value of the security at that point in time  and could be higher than the amount of losses indicated by these scenarios

of the billion in this portfolio as of december   billion represented investments in cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the investments in this portfolio also included billion of non mortgage related securities that we could sell to provide us with an additional source of liquidity to fund our business operations

in addition  we use the portfolio to hold capital on a temporary basis until we can deploy it into mortgage related investments or credit guarantee opportunities 
we may also sell the securities in this portfolio to meet mortgage funding needs  provide diverse sources of liquidity or help manage the interest rate risk inherent in mortgage related assets 
during  we increased the balance of our cash and other investments portfolio by billion  primarily due to a billion increase in highly liquid shorter term cash and cash equivalent assets  including deposits in financial institutions and commercial paper  partially offset by a billion decrease in longer term non mortgage related investments  including asset backed securities 
as a result of counterparty credit concerns during the latter half of  these deposits in financial institutions included substantial cash balances in accounts that did not earn interest

the decrease in additions to our guarantee asset during compared to was primarily due to a decrease in the overall issuance volume of our guaranteed securities 
our issuance volume progressively decreased during the second half of freddie mac 
table of contents as the housing market slowed and seller servicers increasingly utilized fha and ginnie mae programs for newly originated mortgages 
fair value losses on guarantee asset increased for compared to  primarily due to significant declines in interest rates during  particularly in the fourth quarter  as well as declines in market valuations for excess servicing  interest only mortgage securities  which we use to value our guarantee asset 
as a result of certain government actions  funding costs for many financial institutions declined  which caused the average rates for conventional single family mortgages to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of real estate owned  net we acquire residential properties in satisfaction of borrower defaults on mortgage loans that we own or for which we have issued our financial guarantees 
the balance of our reo  net increased substantially to billion at december  from billion at december  our single family reo property inventory doubled during  with the most significant amount of acquisitions in the states of california  arizona  florida  michigan and nevada 
reo acquisitions in the west region and florida generally have higher average property values due to home price appreciation prior to the more recent decreases in home prices 
our temporary suspension of foreclosure sales on occupied homes from november  through january  caused a decrease in the growth of reo acquisitions and inventory in december we reinstated the suspension of foreclosure sales on occupied homes from february  through march  the expiration of this suspension will likely result in continued growth of our reo inventory during see credit risks mortgage credit risk credit loss performance for additional information 
net deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the expected future tax consequences of existing temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax reporting basis of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
the realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income or upon our intent and ability to hold available for sale debt securities until the recovery of any temporary unrealized losses 
on a quarterly basis  we determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
in so doing  we consider all evidence currently available  both positive and negative  in determining whether  based on the weight of that evidence  the net deferred tax assets will be realized and whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
subsequent to the date of our entry into conservatorship  we determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of our net deferred tax assets would not be realized due to our inability to generate sufficient taxable income 
we made the same determination in the fourth quarter of after a thorough evaluation of available evidence  including the events and developments related to our conservatorship  other recent events in the market  and related difficulty in forecasting future profit levels 
as a result  in  we recorded a billion partial valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  including billion recorded in the fourth quarter 
as of december   we had a remaining deferred tax asset of billion representing the tax effect of unrealized losses on our available for sale debt securities  which management believes is more likely than not of being realized because of our intent and ability to hold these securities until the unrealized losses are recovered

total stockholders equity deficit total stockholders equity deficit at december  reflects the following actions as a result of the purchase agreement the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock increased by billion  reflecting the issuance of billion of senior preferred stock on september  and our receipt of billion on november  from treasury 
we issued a warrant to treasury with an estimated value of billion for the purchase of our common stock representing of our common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis at the time of exercise at a price of per share 
we paid dividends of million in cash on the senior preferred stock to treasury on december  at the direction of our conservator 
we issued the senior preferred stock and the warrant to treasury in consideration for the commitment set forth in the purchase agreement  and for no other consideration 
as a result  the issuance of the senior preferred stock and warrant to treasury had no impact on total stockholders equity deficit as the offset was to additional paid in capital 
if we do not pay future dividends on the senior preferred stock in cash  the amount of the dividend will be added to the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock 
without the consent of treasury  we are restricted from making payments to purchase or redeem our common or preferred stock as well as paying any dividends  including preferred dividends  other than dividends on the senior preferred stock 
we did not declare common or preferred dividends during the second half of other than on the senior preferred stock 
total stockholders equity deficit also reflects the following actions of the director of fhfa  as conservator the elimination of the par value of our common stock  which resulted in the reclassification of million from common stock to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  an increase in the number of common shares available for issuance to four billion shares as of december  see executive summary for additional information regarding our purchase agreement with treasury and actions taken by fhfa  as conservator 
total stockholders equity deficit decreased billion during this decrease was primarily a result of a net loss of billion during  a billion net decrease in aoci  billion of common and preferred stock dividends declared prior to conservatorship  and billion of senior preferred stock dividends to treasury 
these factors were partially offset by an increase of billion to our beginning retained earnings as a result of the adoption of sfas and the billion increase in the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock  of which the initial billion of the liquidation preference had no impact on the total stockholders equity deficit 
the balance of aoci at december  was a net loss of approximately billion  net of taxes  compared to a net loss of billion  net of taxes  at freddie mac

these off balance sheet items predominantly consist of a the unrecognized guarantee asset and guarantee obligation associated with our pcs issued through our guarantor swap program prior to the implementation of fin  b certain commitments to purchase mortgage loans and c certain credit enhancements on manufactured housing asset backed securities 
the fair value balance sheets also include certain assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments such as property and equipment and real estate owned  which are included in other assets at their carrying value in accordance with gaap 
during and  our fair value results were impacted by several improvements in our approach for estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments 
see off balance sheet arrangements and critical accounting policies and estimates as well as note summary of significant accounting policies and note fair value disclosures to our consolidated financial statements for more information on fair values 
in conjunction with the preparation of our consolidated fair value balance sheets  we use a number of financial models 
see risk factors  operational risks and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and other market risks for information concerning the risks associated with these models 
key components of changes in fair value of net assets our attribution of changes in the fair value of net assets relies on models  assumptions  and other measurement techniques that evolve over time 
changes in the fair value of net assets from period to period result from returns measured on a fair value basis on our investment and credit guarantee activities and capital transactions and are primarily attributable to changes in a number of key components investment activities core spread income core spread income on our mortgage related investments portfolio is a fair value estimate of the net current period accrual of income from the spread between our mortgage related investments and our debt  calculated on an option adjusted basis 
oas is an estimate of the yield spread between a given financial instrument and a benchmark libor  agency or treasury yield curve  after consideration of potential variability in the instrument s cash flows resulting from any options embedded in the instrument  such as prepayment options 
changes in mortgage to debt oas the fair value of our net assets can be significantly affected from period to period by changes in the net oas between the mortgage and agency debt sectors 
the fair value impact of changes in oas for a given period represents an estimate of the net unrealized increase or decrease in fair value of net assets arising from net fluctuations in oas during that period 
we do not attempt to hedge or actively manage the basis risk represented by the impact of changes in mortgage to debt oas because we generally hold a substantial portion of our mortgage assets for the long term and we do not believe that periodic increases or decreases in the fair value of net assets arising from fluctuations in oas will significantly affect the long term value of our mortgage related investments portfolio 
our estimate of the effect of changes in oas excludes the impact of other market risk factors we actively manage  or economically hedge  to keep interest rate risk exposure within prescribed limits 
asset liability management return asset liability management return represents the estimated net increase or decrease in the fair value of net assets resulting from net exposures related to the market risks we actively manage 
we do not hedge all of the interest rate risk that exists at the time a mortgage is purchased or that arises over its life 
the market risks to which we are exposed as a result of freddie mac 
table of contents our mortgage related investments portfolio activities that we actively manage include duration and convexity risks  yield curve risk and volatility risk 
we seek to manage these risk exposures within prescribed limits as part of our overall portfolio management strategy 
taking these risk positions and managing them within prudent limits is an integral part of our investment activity 
we expect that the net exposures related to market risks we actively manage will generate fair value returns  although those positions may result in a net increase or decrease in fair value for a given period 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and other market risks for more information 
credit guarantee activities core management and guarantee fees  net core management and guarantee fees  net represents a fair value estimate of the annual income of the credit guarantee portfolio  based on current portfolio characteristics and market conditions 
this estimate considers both contractual management and guarantee fees collected over the life of the credit guarantee portfolio and credit related delivery fees collected up front when pools are formed  and associated costs and obligations  which include default costs 
change in the fair value of the credit guarantee portfolio change in the fair value of the credit guarantee portfolio represents the estimated impact on the fair value of the credit guarantee business resulting from additions to the portfolio net difference between the fair values of the guarantee asset and guarantee obligation recorded when pools are formed plus the effect of changes in interest rates  projections of the future credit outlook and other market factors eg  impact of the passage of time on cash flow discounting 
our estimated fair value of the credit guarantee portfolio will change as credit conditions change 
we generally do not hedge changes in the fair value of our existing credit guarantee portfolio  with two exceptions discussed below 
while periodic changes in the fair value of the credit guarantee portfolio may have a significant impact on the fair value of net assets  we believe that changes in the fair value of our existing credit guarantee portfolio are not the best indication of long term fair value expectations because such changes do not reflect our expectation that  over time  replacement business will largely replenish management and guarantee fee income lost because of prepayments 
however  to the extent that projections of the future credit outlook reflected in the changes in fair value are realized  our fair value results may be affected 
we hedge interest rate exposure related to net buy ups up front payments we make that increase the management and guarantee fee that we will receive over the life of the pool and float expected gains or losses resulting from our mortgage security program remittance cycles 
these value changes are excluded from our estimate of the changes in fair value of the credit guarantee portfolio  so that it reflects only the impact of changes in interest rates and other market factors on the unhedged portion of the projected cash flows from the credit guarantee business 
the fair value changes associated with net buy ups and float are considered in asset liability management return described above because they relate to hedged positions 
fee income fee income includes resecuritization fees  fees generated by our automated underwriting service and delivery fees on some mortgage purchases

estimated impact of changes in mortgage to debt oas on fair value results for and  we estimate that on a pre tax basis the changes in the fair value of net assets  before capital transactions  included decreases of approximately billion and billion  respectively  due to a net widening of mortgage to debt oas 
how we estimate the impact of changes in mortgage to debt oas on fair value results the impact of changes in oas on fair value should be understood as an estimate rather than a precise measurement 
to estimate the impact of oas changes  we use models that involve the forecast of interest rates and prepayment behavior and other inputs 
we also make assumptions about a variety of factors  including macroeconomic and security specific data  interest rate paths  cash flows and prepayment rates 
we use these models and assumptions in running our business  and we rely on many of the models in producing our financial statements and measuring  managing and reporting interest rate and other market risks 
the use of different estimation methods or the application of different assumptions could result in a materially different estimate of oas impact 
an integral part of this framework includes the attribution of fair value changes to assess the performance of our investment activities 
on a daily basis  all interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and derivatives are modeled using our proprietary prepayment and interest rate models 
management uses interest rate risk statistics generated from this process  along with daily market movements  coupon accruals and price changes  to estimate and attribute returns into various risk factors commonly used in the fixed income industry to quantify and understand sources of fair value return 
one important risk factor is the change in fair value due to changes in mortgage to debt oas 
understanding our estimate of the impact of changes in mortgage to debt oas on fair value results a number of important qualifications apply to our disclosed estimates 
the estimated impact of the change in oas on the fair value of our net assets in any given period does not depend on other components of the change in fair value 
although the fair values of our financial instruments will generally move toward their par values as the instruments approach maturity  investors should not expect that the effect of past changes in oas will necessarily reverse through future changes in oas 
to the extent that actual prepayment or interest rate distributions differ from the forecasts contemplated in our models  changes in values reflected in mortgage to debt oas may not be recovered in fair value returns at a later date 
when the oas on a given asset widens  the fair value of that asset will typically decline  all other things being equal 
however  we believe such oas widening has the effect of increasing the likelihood that  in future periods  we will recognize income at a higher spread on this existing asset 
the reverse is true when the oas on a given asset tightens current period fair values for that asset typically increase due to the tightening in oas  while future income recognized on the asset is more likely to be earned at a reduced spread 
although a widening of oas is generally accompanied by lower current period fair values  it can also provide us with greater opportunity to purchase new assets for our mortgage related investments portfolio at the wider mortgage to debt oas 
for these reasons  our estimate of the impact of the change in oas provides information regarding one component of the change in fair value for the particular period being evaluated 
in addition  results for a single period should not be used to extrapolate long term fair value returns 
we believe the potential fair value return of our business over the long term depends primarily on our ability to add new assets at attractive mortgage to debt oas and to effectively manage over time the risks associated with these assets  as well as the risks of our existing portfolio 
estimated impact of credit guarantee activities on fair value results our credit guarantee activities  including multifamily and single family mortgage loan credit exposure  decreased pre tax fair value by an estimated billion in this estimate includes an increase in the single family guarantee obligation of approximately billion  primarily due to a declining credit environment 
this increase in the single family guarantee freddie mac 
table of contents obligation includes a reduction of billion in the fair value of our guarantee obligation recorded on january   as a result of our adoption of sfas liquidity and capital resources liquidity our business activities require that we maintain adequate liquidity to fund our operations  which may include the need to make payments upon the maturity  redemption or repurchase of our debt securities  make payments of principal and interest on our debt securities and on our pcs and structured securities  make net payments on derivative instruments  pay dividends on our senior preferred stock  purchase mortgage related securities and other investments  and purchase mortgage loans 
see risk management and disclosure commitments for a discussion of our agreement with fhfa to maintain and periodically test a liquidity management and contingency plan 
pursuant to this agreement  fhfa periodically assesses the size of our liquidity portfolio 
we fund our cash requirements primarily by issuing short term and long term debt 
other sources of cash include receipts of principal and interest payments on securities or mortgage loans we hold  other cash flows from operating activities  including guarantee activities  borrowings against mortgage related securities and other investment securities we hold  and sales of securities we hold 
as described below under actions of treasury  the federal reserve and fhfa  treasury  the federal reserve and fhfa have taken a number of actions that affect our cash requirements and ability to fund those requirements 
the support of treasury and the federal reserve to date has enabled us to access debt funding on terms sufficient for our needs 
as discussed above  our dividend obligations on the senior preferred stock are substantial  and make it more likely that we will face increasingly negative cash flows from operations 
for more information  see risk factors conservatorship and related developments factors including credit losses from our mortgage guarantee activities have had an increasingly negative impact on our cash flows from operations during and as we anticipate these trends to continue for the foreseeable future  it is likely that the company will increasingly rely upon access to the public debt markets as a source of funding for ongoing operations 
access to such public debt markets may not be available 
we measure our cash position on a daily basis  netting uses of cash with sources of cash 
we manage the net cash position with the goal of providing debt funds to cover expected net cash outflows without adversely affecting overall funding costs 
our approach to liquidity management has three components we are required to maintain a net cash surplus for at least days based on projected outflows and inflows  we maintain alternative sources of liquidity to allow normal operations without relying upon the issuance of unsecured debt 
the alternative sources of liquidity include potential sales from our cash and other investments portfolio and our ability to borrow against our largely unencumbered agency mortgage related investments portfolio through repurchase transactions with treasury under the lending agreement  as current market conditions make it difficult to find other suitable counterparties for such transactions  and our liquidity management policy requires us to maintain a portfolio of liquid  marketable  non mortgage related securities with maturities greater than days or designated money market instruments of at least billion 
these securities provide liquidity either through potential sales or our receipt of payments from the securities  including at maturity 
we monitor compliance with these requirements on a daily basis 
we periodically conduct tests of our ability to implement our liquidity plans in response to hypothetical liquidity events 
as discussed below under mortgage related investments portfolio  current market conditions limit the availability of the assets in our mortgage related investments portfolio as a significant source of funding 
consequently  our long term liquidity contingency strategy currently is dependent on use of the lending agreement  which expires on december  we may require cash in order to fulfill our mortgage purchase commitments 
historically  we fulfilled our purchase commitments related to our mortgage purchase flow business primarily by swap transactions  whereby our customers exchange mortgage loans for pcs  rather than through cash outlays 
however  it is at the discretion of the seller  subject to limitations imposed by the contract governing the commitment  whether the purchase commitment is fulfilled by a swap transaction or through the exchange of cash 
since mortgage interest rates declined late in the fourth quarter of  there has been an increase in refinance mortgage originations 
a higher than historically experienced volume of these refinance originations have been delivered to us for cash purchase rather than for swap transactions 
we provide liquidity to our seller servicers through our cash purchase program 
loans purchased through the cash purchase program are typically sold to investors through a cash auction of pcs  and  in the interim  are carried as mortgage loans on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  because of continuing market disruptions in the second half of  demand for our cash auctions of pcs freddie mac 
table of contents has continued to be negatively impacted  and  when coupled with our increased cash purchase activity  resulted in us retaining higher balances of single family mortgage loans at december  than at december  see off balance sheet arrangements other for additional information regarding our purchase commitments at december  for use of the fedwire system  the federal reserve requires that we fully fund our account in the system to the extent necessary to cover payments on our debt and mortgage related securities each day  before the federal reserve bank of new york  acting as our fiscal agent  will initiate such payments 
we have open lines of credit with third parties  certain of which require that we post collateral that  in certain limited circumstances  the secured party has the right to repledge to other third parties  including the federal reserve bank 
as of december   we pledged approximately billion of securities to these secured parties 
these lines of credit  which provide intraday liquidity to fund our activities through the fedwire system  are uncommitted intraday loan facilities 
as a result  while we expect to continue to use these facilities  we may not be able to draw on them if and when needed 
see note investments in securities collateral pledged to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
depending on market conditions and the mix of derivatives we employ in connection with our ongoing risk management activities  our derivative portfolio can be either a net source or a net use of cash 
for example  depending on the prevailing interest rate environment  interest rate swap agreements could cause us either to make interest payments to counterparties or to receive interest payments from counterparties 
purchased options require us to pay a premium while written options allow us to receive a premium 
we are required to pledge collateral to third parties in connection with secured financing and daily trade activities 
in accordance with contracts with certain derivative counterparties  we post collateral to those counterparties for derivatives in a net loss position  after netting by counterparty  above agreed upon posting thresholds 
see note investments in securities collateral pledged to our consolidated financial statements for information about assets we pledge as collateral 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  including those discussed in legal proceedings  which may result in a use of cash 
actions of treasury  the federal reserve and fhfa treasury  the federal reserve and fhfa have taken a number of actions that affect our cash requirements and ability to fund those requirements  including the following we have entered into the purchase agreement with treasury  in connection with which treasury has provided us with its announced commitment to provide up to billion in funding under specified conditions  we may request funds from treasury until december  under our lending agreement with treasury  treasury has implemented a program to purchase mortgage related securities issued by freddie mac and fannie mae  under which treasury held billion of gse mortgage related securities as of january  the federal reserve has implemented a program to purchase up to billion in direct obligations of freddie mac  fannie mae and the fhlbs and up to billion of mortgage related securities issued by freddie mac  fannie mae and ginnie mae 
the federal reserve will purchase these direct obligations and mortgage related securities from primary dealers 
under this program  the federal reserve held billion of our direct obligations and purchased billion of our mortgage related securities as of february   fhfa  as conservator  has eliminated the dividends on our common stock and preferred stock other than the senior preferred stock  and fhfa has suspended our capital requirements and the requirement to provide funds to the hud and treasury housing funds established by the reform act 
the purchase agreement provides that  if fhfa determines that our liabilities exceed our assets under gaap  treasury will contribute funds in an amount equal to the difference between such liabilities and assets  a higher amount may be drawn if treasury and freddie mac mutually agree that the draw should be increased beyond the level by which liabilities exceed assets under gaap 
on november   we received billion from treasury under the purchase agreement  and we expect to receive an additional billion in march as a result of our draws under the purchase agreement  the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock will increase from billion as of september  to billion 
our annual dividend obligation  based on that liquidation preference  will be billion  which is in excess of our annual net income in eight of the ten prior fiscal years 
these dividend obligations make it more likely that we will face increasingly negative cash flows from operations 
to date  our need for funding under the purchase agreement has not been caused by cash flow shortfalls but rather primarily reflects large credit related expenses and non cash fair value adjustments as well as a partial valuation allowance freddie mac 
table of contents against our net deferred tax assets that resulted in reductions to our gaap stockholders equity deficit 
however  we expect this to change  particularly in light of the size of our dividend obligation in future periods 
under the purchase agreement  our ability to repay the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock is limited and we will not be able to do so for the foreseeable future  if at all 
the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock and our related dividend obligations will increase further if we make additional draws under the purchase agreement or any dividends or quarterly commitment fees payable under the purchase agreement are not paid in cash 
the amounts payable for dividends on the senior preferred stock are substantial and will have an adverse impact on our financial position and net worth and  to the extent they are paid in cash  will increase the need for additional funding under the purchase agreement 
the purchase agreement includes significant restrictions on our ability to manage our business  including limiting the amount of indebtedness we can incur and capping the size of our mortgage related investments portfolio as of december  in addition  beginning in  we must decrease the size of our mortgage related investments portfolio at the rate of per year until it reaches billion 
depending on the pace of future mortgage liquidations  we may need to reduce or eliminate our purchases of mortgage assets or sell mortgage assets to achieve this reduction 
we currently do not have plans to sell our mortgage assets at a loss 
in addition  while the senior preferred stock is outstanding  we are prohibited from paying dividends other than on the senior preferred stock or issuing equity securities without treasury s consent 
the terms of the purchase agreement and warrant make it unlikely that we will be able to obtain equity from private sources 
for additional information concerning the potential impact of the purchase agreement  including taking additional large draws  see risk factors conservatorship and related developments 
we have not received funding to date under the lending agreement 
given that the interest rate we are likely to be charged under the lending agreement will be significantly higher than the rates we have historically achieved through the sale of unsecured debt  use of the facility in significant amounts could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
the lending agreement will terminate on december   but will remain in effect as to any loan outstanding on that date 
after december   treasury still may purchase up to billion of our obligations under its permanent authority  as set forth in our charter 
in an effort to conserve capital  on september   fhfa  as conservator  announced the elimination of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock  excluding the senior preferred stock issued to treasury under the purchase agreement 
on september   fhfa  as conservator  advised us of fhfa s determination that no further common or preferred stock dividends should be paid by our reit subsidiaries  home ownership funding corporation and home ownership funding corporation ii 
since we are the majority owner of both the common and preferred shares of these two reits  this action has eliminated our access through such dividend payments to the cash flows of the reits 
on october   fhfa announced that it was suspending capital classification of freddie mac during conservatorship in light of the purchase agreement 
fhfa has directed us to focus our risk and capital management activities on  among other things  maintaining a positive balance of gaap stockholders equity in order to reduce the likelihood that we will need to make additional draws on the purchase agreement with treasury 
however  fhfa has also directed us to pursue other objectives  such as providing relief to struggling homeowners  which can conflict with maintaining positive stockholders equity 
in addition  notwithstanding our failure to maintain required capital levels  fhfa has directed us to continue to make interest and principal payments on our subordinated debt 
for more information  see capital adequacy and business regulation and supervision federal housing finance agency other regulatory actions 
the reform act requires us to set aside in each fiscal year  an amount equal to basis points for each dollar of the unpaid principal balance of total new business purchases  and allocate or transfer such amount i to hud to fund a housing trust fund established and managed by hud and ii to a capital magnet fund established and managed by treasury 
fhfa has the authority to suspend our allocation upon finding that the payment would contribute to our financial instability  cause us to be classified as undercapitalized or prevent us from successfully completing a capital restoration plan 
fhfa advised us that it has suspended the requirement to set aside or allocate funds for the housing trust fund and the capital magnet fund until further notice

debt securities we fund our business activities primarily through the issuance of short and long term debt 
competition for funding can vary with economic  financial market and regulatory environments 
historically  we mainly competed for funds in the debt issuance markets with fannie mae and the fhlbs 
however  we face increasing competition for funding from other debt issuers  as many of our bank competitors are currently able to issue debt that is guaranteed by the us government 
freddie mac 
table of contents this development may increase our funding costs 
we repurchase or call our outstanding debt securities from time to time to help support the liquidity and predictability of the market for our debt securities and to manage our mix of liabilities funding our assets 
to fund our business activities  we depend on the continuing willingness of investors to purchase our debt securities 
any change in applicable legislative or regulatory exemptions  including those described in business regulation and supervision  could adversely affect our access to some debt investors  thereby potentially increasing our debt funding costs 
during  worldwide financial markets experienced substantial levels of volatility 
this was particularly true over the latter half of as market participants struggled to digest the new government initiatives  including our conservatorship 
in this environment where demand for debt instruments weakened considerably  and the debt funding markets are sometimes frozen  our ability to access both the term and callable debt markets has been limited  and we have relied increasingly on the issuance of shorter term debt 
while we use interest rate derivatives to economically hedge a significant portion of our interest rate exposure  we are exposed to risks relating to both our ability to issue new debt when our outstanding debt matures and to the variability in interest costs on our new issuances of debt 
in the second half of  we experienced less demand for our debt securities  as reflected in wider spreads on our term and callable debt 
this reflected overall deterioration in our access to unsecured medium and long term debt markets 
however  the federal reserve has been an active purchaser in the secondary market of our long term debt under its purchase program  and spreads on our debt and our access to the debt markets have improved in early as a result of this activity 
there are many factors contributing to the reduced demand for our debt securities in the capital markets  including continued severe market disruptions  market concerns about our capital position and the future of our business including its future profitability  future structure  regulatory actions and agency status and the extent of us government support for our debt securities 
in addition  the various us government programs are still being digested by market participants creating uncertainty as to whether competing obligations of other companies are more attractive investments than our debt securities 
as noted above  due to our limited ability to issue long term debt  we have relied increasingly on short term debt to fund our purchases of mortgage assets and to refinance maturing debt 
as a result  we have been required to refinance our debt on a more frequent basis  exposing us to an increased risk of insufficient demand  increasing interest rates and adverse credit market conditions 
it is unclear if or when these market conditions will reverse allowing us increased access to the longer term debt markets that is not based on support from treasury and the federal reserve 
see risk factors for a discussion of the risks to our business posed by our reliance on the issuance of debt to fund our operations 
the purchase agreement provides that  without the prior consent of treasury  we may not increase our indebtedness as defined in the purchase agreement above a specified limit or become liable for any subordinated indebtedness 
for the purposes of the purchase agreement  the balance of our indebtedness at december  did not exceed the specified limit

short term debt we fund our operating cash needs  in part  by issuing reference bills securities and other discount notes  which are short term instruments with maturities of one year or less that are sold on a discounted basis  paying only principal at maturity 
our reference bills securities program consists of large issues of short term debt that we auction to dealers on a regular schedule 
we issue discount notes with maturities ranging from one day to one year in response to investor demand freddie mac 
table of contents and our cash needs 
short term debt also includes certain medium term notes that have original maturities of one year or less 
long term debt we issue debt with maturities greater than one year primarily through our medium term notes program and our reference notes securities program 
medium term notes we issue a variety of fixed and variable rate medium term notes  including callable and non callable fixed rate securities  zero coupon securities and variable rate securities  with various maturities ranging up to years 
medium term notes with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short term debt 
medium term notes typically contain call provisions  effective as early as three months or as long as ten years after the securities are issued 
reference notes securities reference notes securities are regularly issued  us dollar denominated  non callable fixed rate securities  which we currently issue with original maturities ranging from two through ten years 
we have also issued reference notes securities denominated in euros  which remain outstanding  but did not issue any such securities in or we hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into swap transactions that convert foreign currency denominated obligations to us dollar denominated obligations 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and other market risks sources of interest rate risk and other market risks for more information 
the investor base for our debt is predominantly institutional

subordinated debt during  we did not issue or call any freddie subs securities 
during  we called billion of higher cost freddie subs securities  while not issuing any new freddie subs securities 
at both december  and  the balance of our subordinated debt outstanding was billion 
our subordinated debt in the form of freddie subs securities is a component of our risk management and disclosure commitments with fhfa 
see risk management and disclosure commitments for a discussion of changes affecting our subordinated debt as a result of our placement in conservatorship and the purchase agreement  and the conservator s suspension of certain requirements relating to our subordinated debt 
under the purchase agreement  we may not issue subordinated debt without treasury s consent 
debt retirement activities we repurchase or call our outstanding debt securities from time to time to help support the liquidity and predictability of the market for our debt securities and to manage our mix of liabilities funding our assets 
when our debt securities become seasoned or one time call options on our debt securities expire  they may become less liquid  which could cause their price to decline 
by repurchasing debt securities  we help preserve the liquidity of our debt securities and improve their price performance  which helps to reduce our funding costs over the long term 
our repurchase activities also help us manage the funding mismatch  or duration gap  created by changes in interest rates 
for example  when interest rates decline  the expected lives of the mortgage related securities held in our mortgage related investments portfolio decrease  reducing the need for long term debt 
we use a number of different means to shorten the effective weighted average lives of our outstanding debt securities and thereby manage the duration gap  including retiring long term debt through repurchases or calls  changing our debt funding mix between short and long term debt  or using derivative instruments  such as entering into receive fixed swaps or terminating or assigning pay fixed swaps 
from time to time  we may also enter into transactions in which we exchange newly issued debt securities for similar outstanding debt securities held by investors 
these transactions are accounted for as debt exchanges

table of contents credit ratings our ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funding  as well as our cost of funds  are highly dependent upon our credit ratings

cash and other investments portfolio we maintain a cash and other investments portfolio that is important to our financial management and our ability to provide liquidity and stability to the mortgage market 
at december   the investments in this portfolio consisted of liquid non mortgage related securities that we could sell to provide us with an additional source of liquidity to fund our business operations 
for additional information on our cash and other investments portfolio  see consolidated balance sheets analysis cash and other investments portfolio 
the non mortgage related investments in this portfolio may expose us to institutional credit risk and the risk that the investments could decline in value due to market driven events such as credit downgrades or changes in interest rates and other market conditions 
see credit risks institutional credit risk for more information 
mortgage related investments portfolio historically  our mortgage related investments portfolio assets have been a significant capital resource and a potential source of funding  if needed 
a large majority of this portfolio is unencumbered 
however  deteriorating market conditions have made it unlikely that we could obtain substantial amounts of funding by using these securities as collateral in repurchase transactions or other forms of secured borrowing  other than pursuant to the lending agreement 
during  the market for non agency securities backed by subprime  alt a and other loans and mta mortgages continued to experience a significant reduction in liquidity and wider spreads  as investor demand for these assets decreased 
during  the percentages of our non agency securities backed by subprime mortgages that were aaa rated and the total rated as investment grade  based on the lowest rating available  decreased from to and from to  respectively 
in addition  during  the percentages of our non agency securities backed by alt a and other mortgages that were aaa rated and the total rated as investment grade  based on the lowest rating available  decreased from to and from to  respectively 
also  during  the percentages of our non agency securities backed by mta loans that were aaa rated and the total rated as investment grade  based on the lowest rating available  decreased from to and from to  respectively 
we expect these trends to continue in the near future 
these market conditions  and the declining credit quality of the assets  limit their availability as a significant source of funds  as their value has declined  and it may be more difficult to sell them 
however  we do continue to receive monthly remittances  although declining  from the underlying collateral 
in addition  we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery and  other than certain freddie mac 
table of contents mortgage related securities primarily backed by subprime loans  alt a and other loans  and mta loans where we have already realized other than temporary impairments  we do not currently expect the cash flows from these securities to negatively impact our liquidity

on september   the director of fhfa announced that fhfa had directed us to provide additional funding to the mortgage markets through the purchase of mortgage related securities 
this directive  however  does not supersede the restrictions on the size of our mortgage related investments portfolio under the purchase agreement 
under the purchase agreement and fhfa regulation  our mortgage related investments portfolio as of december  may not exceed billion  and must decline by per year thereafter until it reaches billion 
cash flows our cash and cash equivalents increased billion to billion during beginning in the second quarter of  all investments in commercial paper with maturities of less than three months were entered into for working capital purposes 
consequently  commercial paper with maturities of less than three months was classified as cash and cash equivalents rather than investments 
cash flows used for operating activities during were billion  which primarily reflected a reduction in cash as a result of increases in purchases of held for sale mortgage loans 
cash flows used for investing activities during were billion  primarily resulting from purchases of trading securities and available for sale securities  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of available for sale securities and sales of trading securities 
cash flows provided by financing activities in were billion  largely attributable to proceeds from the issuance of debt securities  net of repayments 
sfas requires the classification of trading securities cash flows based on the purpose for which the securities were acquired 
upon adoption of sfas  effective january   we classified our trading securities cash flows as investing activities because we intend to hold these securities for investment purposes 
prior to our adoption of sfas  we classified cash flows on all trading securities as operating activities 
as a result  the operating and investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows have been impacted by this change 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased billion to billion during cash flows used for operating activities in were billion  which reflected a reduction in cash primarily from a decrease in liabilities to pc investors as a result of a change in our pc issuance process to use of securitization trusts 
net cash used was primarily provided by net interest income  management and guarantee fees and changes in other operating assets and liabilities 
cash flows provided by investing activities in were billion  primarily due to a net increase in cash flows as we reduced our balance of federal funds sold and eurodollars 
this was partially offset by an increase in cash used to purchase mortgage loans under financial guarantees as a result of increasing delinquencies 
cash flows used for financing activities in were billion and resulted from a decrease in debt securities  net  preferred and common stock repurchases and dividends paid 
cash used was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock 
our cash and cash equivalents increased billion to billion during cash flows provided by operating activities in were billion  which primarily reflected cash flows provided by net interest income  management and guarantee fees and changes in other operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by non interest expenses 
cash flows used for investing activities in were billion  primarily resulting from purchases of held for investment mortgages and available for sale securities  as well as a net decrease in cash flows from federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities and repayments of held for investment mortgages 
cash flows used for financing activities in were billion and were primarily due to repayments of debt securities  repurchases of common stock  payment of cash dividends on preferred stock and common stock  and payments of housing tax credit partnerships notes payable  partially offset by proceeds from issuance of debt securities 
capital adequacy our entry into conservatorship resulted in significant changes to the assessment of our capital adequacy and our management of capital 
on october   fhfa announced that it was suspending capital classification of us during conservatorship in light of the purchase agreement 
concurrent with this announcement  fhfa classified us as undercapitalized as of june  based on discretionary authority provided by statute 
fhfa noted that although our capital calculations as of june  reflected that we met the statutory and fhfa directed requirements for capital  the continued market downturn in july and august of raised significant questions about the sufficiency of our capital 
factors cited by fhfa leading to the downgrade in our capital classification and the need for conservatorship included a our accelerated safety and soundness weaknesses  especially with regard to our credit risk  earnings outlook and capitalization  b continued and substantial deterioration in equity  debt and mortgage related securities market conditions  c our current and projected financial performance  d our inability to raise capital or issue debt according to normal freddie mac 
table of contents practices and prices  e our critical importance in supporting the us residential mortgage markets and f concerns over the growing proportion of intangible assets as part of our core capital 
fhfa continues to closely monitor our capital levels  but the existing statutory and fhfa directed regulatory capital requirements are not binding during conservatorship 
we continue to provide our regular submissions to fhfa on both minimum and risk based capital 
fhfa continues to publish relevant capital figures minimum capital requirement  core capital  and gaap net worth but does not publish our critical capital  risk based capital or subordinated debt levels during conservatorship 
additionally  fhfa announced on october  that it will engage in rule making to revise our minimum capital and risk based capital requirements 
see note regulatory capital to our consolidated financial statements for our minimum capital requirement  core capital and gaap net worth results as of december  fhfa has directed us to focus our risk and capital management  among other things  on maintaining a positive balance of gaap stockholders equity in order to reduce the likelihood that we will need to make additional draws on the purchase agreement with treasury  while returning to long term profitability 
the purchase agreement provides that  if fhfa determines as of quarter end that our liabilities have exceeded our assets under gaap  treasury will contribute funds to us in an amount equal to the difference between such liabilities and assets 
the maximum aggregate amount that may be funded under the purchase agreement initially was billion  which treasury has committed to increase to billion 
under the reform act  fhfa must place us into receivership if fhfa determines in writing that our assets are less than our obligations for a period of days 
fhfa has notified us that the measurement period for any mandatory receivership determination with respect to our assets and obligations would commence no earlier than the sec public filing deadline for our quarterly or annual financial statements and would continue for calendar days after that date 
see business regulation and supervision federal housing finance agency receivership for additional information on mandatory receivership 
at december  our liabilities exceeded our assets under gaap by billion while our stockholders equity deficit totaled billion 
as such  we must obtain funding from treasury pursuant to its commitment under the purchase agreement in order to avoid being placed into receivership by fhfa 
on november   we received billion from treasury under the purchase agreement  and we expect to receive an additional billion in march as a result of these draws  the aggregate liquidation preference on the senior preferred stock will increase from billion as of september  to billion and the remaining funding available under treasury s announced commitment will decrease to approximately billion 
we expect to make additional draws on treasury s funding commitment in the future 
the size of such draws will be determined by a variety of factors  including whether market conditions continue to deteriorate 
the senior preferred stock accrues quarterly cumulative dividends at a rate of per year or per year in any quarter in which dividends are not paid in cash until all accrued dividends have been paid in cash 
we paid our first quarterly dividend of million in cash on the senior preferred stock on december  at the direction of our conservator 
following receipt of our pending draw  treasury will be entitled to annual cash dividends of billion  as calculated based on the aggregate liquidation preference of billion 
if we make additional draws under the purchase agreement  this would further increase our dividend obligation 
this substantial ongoing dividend obligation  combined with potentially substantial commitment fees payable to treasury starting in and limited flexibility to pay down draws under the purchase agreement  will have an adverse impact on our future financial position and net worth 
a variety of factors could materially affect the level and volatility of our gaap stockholders equity deficit in future periods  requiring us to make additional draws under the purchase agreement

these non derivative commitments totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the increase in these commitments during is due primarily to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers

effective december  we established securitization trusts for the administration of cash remittances received on the underlying assets of our pcs and structured securities 
we receive trust management income  which represents the fees we earn as master servicer  issuer  trustee and administrator for our pcs and structured securities 
these fees  which are included in our non interest income  are derived from interest earned on principal and interest cash flows held in the trusts between the time funds are remitted to the trusts by servicers and the date of distribution to our pc and structured securities holders 
the trust management income is offset by interest expense we incur when a borrower prepays a mortgage  but the full amount of interest for the month is due to the pc investor 
we have off balance sheet exposure to the trusts of the same maximum amount that applies to our credit risk of our outstanding guarantees  however  we also have exposure to the trusts and applicable institutional counterparties for any investment losses that are incurred in our role as the securities administrator for the trusts 
in accordance with the trust agreements  we invest the funds of the trusts in eligible short term financial instruments that are mainly the highest rated debt types as classified by a nationally recognized rating service organization

see business conservatorship and related developments for further information on both the purchase and lending agreements 
as part of the guarantee arrangements pertaining to certain multifamily housing revenue bonds and securities backed by multifamily housing revenue bonds  we provided commitments to advance funds  commonly referred to as liquidity guarantees  totaling billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
these guarantees require us to advance funds to third parties that enable them to repurchase tendered bonds or securities that are unable to be remarketed 
any repurchased securities are pledged to us to secure funding until the securities are remarketed 
we hold cash and cash equivalents in our cash and other investments portfolio equal to these commitments to advance funds

our contractual obligations include other purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations are included through the termination date specified in the respective agreements  even if the contract is renewable 
many of our purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow us to cancel the agreement prior to the expiration of the contract within a specified notice period  however  this table includes these obligations without regard to such termination clauses unless we have provided the counterparty with actual notice of our intention to terminate the agreement

table of contents in table  the amounts of future interest payments on debt securities outstanding at december  are based on the contractual terms of our debt securities at that date 
these amounts were determined using the key assumptions that a variable rate debt continues to accrue interest at the contractual rates in effect at december  until maturity and b callable debt continues to accrue interest until its contractual maturity 
the amounts of future interest payments on debt securities presented do not reflect certain factors that will change the amounts of interest payments on our debt securities after december   such as a changes in interest rates  b the call or retirement of any debt securities and c the issuance of new debt securities 
accordingly  the amounts presented in the table do not represent a forecast of our future cash interest payments or interest expense 
table excludes the following items any future cash payments associated with the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock  as well as the quarterly commitment fee and the dividends on the senior preferred stock because the timing and amount of any such future cash payments are uncertain 
beginning on march   we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee to treasury  which will accrue from january  we are required to pay this fee  unless waived by treasury  each quarter for as long as the purchase agreement is in effect 
the amount of this fee has not yet been determined

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  income and expenses 
certain of our accounting policies  as well as estimates we make  are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
they often require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments and estimates  regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from our estimates and different judgments and assumptions related to these policies and estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies and estimates relate to a valuation of a significant portion of assets and liabilities  b allowances for loan losses and reserve for guarantee losses  c application of the static effective yield method to amortize the guarantee obligation  d application of the effective interest method  e impairment recognition on investments in securities  and f realizability of net deferred tax assets 
for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies  including recently issued accounting pronouncements  see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of a significant portion of assets and liabilities a significant portion of our assets and liabilities is measured on our consolidated financial statements based on fair value  including i mortgage related and non mortgage related securities  ii mortgage loans held for sale  iii derivative instruments  iv guarantee asset  v guarantee obligation  vi debt securities denominated in foreign currencies and vii reo less cost to sell 
for certain of these assets and liabilities  which are complex in nature  the measurement of fair value requires significant management judgments and assumptions 
these judgments and assumptions  as well as changes in market conditions  may have a material effect on our gaap consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations as well as our consolidated fair value balance sheets 
fair value affects our statements of operations in the following ways for certain financial instruments that are recorded in the gaap consolidated balance sheets at fair value  changes in fair value are recognized in current period earnings 
these include mortgage related securities classified as trading  which are recorded in gains losses on investment activity  derivatives with no hedge designation  which are recorded in derivative gains losses  the guarantee asset  which is recorded in gains losses on guarantee asset  and debt securities denominated in foreign currencies  which are recorded in gains losses on foreign currency denominated debt recorded at fair value 
for other financial instruments that are recorded in the gaap consolidated balance sheets at fair value  changes in fair value are deferred  net of tax  in aoci 
these include mortgage related and non mortgage related securities classified as available for sale  which are initially measured at fair value with deferred gains and losses recognized in aoci 
these deferred gains and losses may affect earnings over time through amortization  sale or impairment recognition  and changes in derivatives that were designated in cash flow hedge accounting relationships 
the deferred gains and losses on closed cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings as the originally forecasted transactions affect earnings 
if it is probable the originally forecasted transaction will not occur  the associated deferred gain or loss in aoci is reclassified to earnings immediately 
our guarantee obligation is initially recorded at an amount equal to the fair value of compensation received in the related securitization transaction  but is not remeasured at fair value on a periodic basis 
this obligation affects earnings over time through amortization to income on guarantee obligation 
mortgage loans purchased under our financial guarantees result in recognition of losses on loans purchased when the fair values of the purchased loans are less than our acquisition basis in the loans at the date of purchase 
mortgage loans  held for sale  include single family and multifamily mortgage loans 
we carry the fair value of single family mortgage loans  held for sale  at the lower of cost or fair value 
we elected the fair value option for multifamily mortgage loans and account for these loans at fair value 
changes in fair value are recorded through earnings in gains losses on investment activity 
reo is initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell and is subsequently carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
when a loan is transferred to reo  losses are charged off against the allowance for loan losses at the time of transfer and gains are recognized immediately in earnings 
subsequent declines in fair value are recorded through earnings losses in reo operations income expense

table of contents fair value measurements effective january   we adopted sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
see determination of fair value for additional information about fair value hierarchy and measurements 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
upon adoption of sfas on january   we began estimating the fair value of our newly issued guarantee obligations at their inception using the practical expedient provided by fin  as amended by sfas using the practical expedient  the initial guarantee obligation is recorded at an amount equal to the fair value of compensation received  inclusive of all rights related to the transaction  in exchange for our guarantee 
as a result  we no longer record estimates of deferred gains or immediate  day one losses on most guarantees 
in addition  amortization of the guarantee obligation now more closely follows our economic release from risk under the guarantee 
all unamortized amounts recorded prior to january  continue to be deferred and amortized using the static effective yield method 
valuation of the guarantee obligation subsequent to initial recognition uses current pricing assumptions and related inputs 
for information regarding our fair value methods and assumptions  see note fair value disclosures to our consolidated financial statements 
determination of fair value sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on the inputs a market participant would use at the measurement date 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs reflect assumptions based on the best information available under the circumstances 
unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available  or in situations where there is little  if any  market activity for an asset or liability at the measurement date 
we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs  where available  and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities  level quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values 
we categorize assets and liabilities in the scope of sfas within the fair value hierarchy based on the valuation process used to derive their fair values and our judgment regarding the observability of the related inputs 
those judgments are based on our knowledge and observations of the markets relevant to the individual assets and liabilities and may vary based on current market conditions 
in applying our judgments  we look to ranges of third party prices  transaction volumes and discussions with dealers and pricing service vendors to understand and assess the extent of market benchmarks available and the judgments or modeling required in their processes 
based on these factors  we determine whether the fair values are observable in active markets or whether the markets are inactive 
our level financial instruments consist of exchange traded derivatives where quoted prices exist for the exact instrument in an active market 
our level instruments generally consist of high credit quality agency mortgage related securities  commercial mortgage backed securities  non mortgage related asset backed securities  interest rate swaps  option based derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt 
these instruments are generally valued through one of the following methods a dealer or pricing service inputs with the value derived by comparison to recent transactions of similar securities and adjusting for differences in prepayment or liquidity characteristics  or b modeled through an industry standard modeling technique that relies upon observable inputs such as discount rates and prepayment assumptions 
our level assets primarily consist of non agency residential mortgage related securities and our guarantee asset 
while the non agency mortgage related securities market has become significantly less liquid  resulting in lower transaction volumes  wider credit spreads and less transparency in  we value our non agency mortgage related securities based primarily on prices received from third party pricing services and prices received from dealers 
the techniques used by these pricing services and dealers to develop the prices generally are either a a comparison to transactions of instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles  or b industry standard modeling such as the discounted cash flow model 
for a large majority of the securities we value using dealers and pricing services  we obtain at least three independent prices  which are non binding to us or our counterparties 
when multiple prices are received  we use the median of the prices 
the models and related assumptions used by the dealers and pricing services are owned and managed by them 
however  we have an understanding of their processes used to develop the prices provided to us based on our ongoing due diligence 
we generally have formal discussions with our dealers and pricing service vendors on a quarterly basis to maintain a current understanding freddie mac 
table of contents of the processes and inputs they use to develop prices 
we make no adjustments to the individual prices we receive from third party pricing services or dealers for non agency mortgage related securities backed by subprime loans  alt a loans and mta loans beyond calculating median prices and discarding certain prices that are not valid based on our validation processes 
see controls over fair value measurement for information on our validation processes 
we consider credit risk in the valuation of our assets and liabilities 
for foreign currency denominated debt with the fair value option elected  the total fair value change was a net gain of billion for of this amount  billion was attributable to changes in the instrument specific credit risk 
the changes in fair value attributable to changes in instrument specific credit risk were determined by comparing the total change in fair value of the debt to the total change in fair value of the interest rate and foreign currency derivatives used to hedge the debt 
any difference in the fair value change of the debt compared to the fair value change in the derivatives is attributed to instrument specific credit risk 
for multifamily held for sale loans with the fair value option elected  we recorded million from the change in fair value in gains losses on investment activity in our consolidated statements of operations during of this amount  million was attributable to changes in the instrument specific credit risk partially offset by changes attributable to interest rate risk 
the gains and losses attributable to changes in instrument specific credit risk related to our multifamily held for sale loans were determined primarily from the changes in oas level 
in addition  we consider credit risk in the valuation of our derivative positions 
for derivatives that are in an asset position  we hold collateral against those positions in accordance with agreed upon thresholds 
the amount of collateral held depends on the credit rating of the counterparty and is based on our credit risk policies 
see credit risks institutional credit risk derivative counterparty credit risk for a discussion of our counterparty credit risk 
similarly  for derivatives that are in a liability position we post collateral to counterparties in accordance with agreed upon thresholds 
the fair value of derivative assets considers the impact of institutional credit risk in the event that the counterparty does not honor its payment obligation 
additionally  the fair value of derivative liabilities considers the impact of our institutional credit risk 
for a description of how we determine the fair value of our guarantee asset  see note retained interests in mortgage related securitizations to our consolidated financial statements 
at december  and  the total unpaid principal balances of pcs and structured securities outstanding were  billion and  billion  respectively 
at december  and  we owned billion and billion  respectively  of pcs and structured securities  or and  respectively  of the total pcs and structured securities outstanding 
there are inherent limitations when trying to extrapolate an amount of the total fair value of the guarantee asset and obligation attributable to the pcs and structured securities we own 
the credit performance of each pool differs  based on the underlying characteristics of the loans  vintage  seasoning  and other factors that cannot be accurately factored into a pro rata allocation 
as a result  a simple pro rata allocation of the fair value of our guarantee asset and obligation based on the percentage of pcs and structured securities we hold relative to total pcs and structured securities outstanding will not necessarily provide a reasonable proxy for the adjustment to the fair value of our pcs and structured securities necessary to derive the fair value of an unguaranteed security 
our valuation process and related sfas hierarchy assessments require us to make judgments regarding the liquidity of the marketplace 
these judgments are based on the volume of securities traded in the marketplace  the width of bid ask spreads and dispersion of prices on similar securities 
as previously mentioned  we have observed a significant reduction in liquidity within the non agency mortgage related security markets 
we continue to utilize the prices provided to us by various pricing services and dealers and believe that the procedures executed by the pricing services and dealers  combined with our internal verification process  ensure that the prices used to develop the financial statements are in accordance with the guidance in sfas we periodically evaluate our valuation techniques and may change them to improve our fair value estimates  to accommodate market developments or to compensate for changes in data availability and reliability or other operational constraints 
we review a range of market quotes from pricing services or dealers and perform analysis of internal valuations on a monthly basis to confirm the reasonableness of the valuations 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and other market risks for a discussion of market risks and our interest rate sensitivity measures  pmvs and duration gap

table of contents table below summarizes our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level in the valuation hierarchy at december  table summary of assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis at december  assets liabilities investments in securities available for sale  at fair value trading  at fair value debt securities mortgage non mortgage mortgage mortgage loans guarantee denominated related related related held for sale  at derivative asset  at in foreign derivative securities securities subtotal securities fair value assets  net fair value total currencies liabilities  net total dollars in millions level level level total total gaap fair value percentages by level are based on gross fair value of derivative assets and derivative liabilities before counterparty netting  cash collateral netting  net trade settle receivable or payable and net derivative interest receivable or payable 
changes in level recurring fair value measurements at december   we measured and recorded on a recurring basis billion  or approximately of total assets  at fair value using significant unobservable inputs level  before the impact of counterparty and cash collateral netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy 
our level assets primarily consist of non agency residential mortgage related securities and our guarantee asset 
we also measured and recorded on a recurring basis million  or less than of total liabilities  at fair value using significant unobservable inputs  before the impact of counterparty and cash collateral netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy 
our level liabilities consist of derivative liabilities  net 
during  our level assets increased significantly because the market for non agency mortgage related securities backed by subprime  alt a and mta mortgage loans continued to experience a significant reduction in liquidity and wider spreads  as investor demand for these assets decreased 
as a result  we have observed more variability in the quotes received from dealers and third party pricing services 
consequently  we transferred billion of level assets to level during these transfers were primarily within non agency mortgage related securities backed by subprime  alt a and mta mortgage loans where inputs that are significant to their valuation became limited or unavailable 
we concluded that the prices on these securities received from pricing services and dealers were reflective of significant unobservable inputs as the markets have become significantly less active  requiring higher degrees of judgment to extrapolate fair values from limited market benchmarks 
we recorded billion of additional losses  partially in aoci  on these transferred assets during  which were included in our level reconciliation

controls over fair value measurement to ensure that fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable  we employ control processes to validate the techniques and models we use 
these control processes include review and approval of new transaction types  price verification and review of valuation judgments  methods  models  process controls and results 
groups independent of our trading and investing function  including financial valuation control and the valuation committee  participate in the review and validation process 
the valuation committee includes senior representation from business areas  our enterprise risk oversight division and our finance division 
our financial valuation control group performs monthly independent verification of fair value measurements by comparing the methodology driven price to other market source data to the extent available  and uses independent analytics to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable 
financial valuation control s review targets coverage across all products with increased attention to higher risk impact valuations 
validation processes are intended to ensure that the individual prices we receive from third parties are consistent with our observations of the marketplace and prices that are provided to us by other dealers or pricing services 
where applicable  prices are back tested by comparing the settlement prices to where fair values were measured 
analytical procedures include automated checks of prices for reasonableness based on variations from prices in previous periods  comparisons of prices to internally calculated expected prices  based on market moves  and relative value comparisons based on specific characteristics of securities 
to the extent that we determine that a price is outside of established parameters  we will further examine the price  including follow up discussions with the specific pricing service or dealer and ultimately not use that price if we are not able to determine the price is valid 
the prices provided to us freddie mac 
table of contents consider the existence of credit enhancements  including monoline insurance coverage and the current lack of liquidity in the marketplace 
these processes are executed prior to the use of the prices in the financial statements 
where models are employed to assist in the measurement of fair value  material changes made to those models during the periods presented are reviewed and approved by the valuation committee 
inputs used by those models are regularly updated for changes in the underlying data  assumptions  valuation inputs  or market conditions 
in addition  the model governance committee is responsible for the review and approval of the pricing models used in our fair value measurements 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities effective january   we adopted sfas for certain eligible financial instruments 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value in order to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the effect of the first measurement to fair value is reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings accumulated deficit 
we elected the fair value option for certain available for sale mortgage related securities that were identified as an economic offset to the changes in fair value of the guarantee asset caused by interest rate movements  foreign currency denominated debt and investments in securities classified as available for sale securities and identified as within the scope of eitf as a result of the adoption of sfas  we recognized a billion after tax increase to our beginning retained earnings accumulated deficit at january  in addition  during the third quarter of  we elected the fair value option for certain multifamily held for sale mortgage loans 
for additional information on the impact of the election of the fair value option  see note summary of significant accounting policies recently adopted accounting standards to our consolidated financial statements 
for information regarding our fair value methods and assumptions  see note fair value disclosures to our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for guarantee losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses on mortgage loans held for investment and a reserve for guarantee losses on pcs  collectively referred to as our loan loss reserves  to provide for credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred 
we use the same methodology to determine our allowance for loan losses and reserve for guarantee losses  as the relevant factors affecting credit risk are the same 
to calculate the loan loss reserves for the single family loan portfolio  we aggregate homogeneous loans into pools based on common underlying characteristics  using statistically based models to evaluate relevant factors affecting loan collectibility 
we consider the output of these models  together with other information about such factors as expected future levels of loan modifications  expected repurchases of loans by seller servicers as a result of their non compliance with our underwriting standards and the effects of such macroeconomic variables as unemployment and home price movements  to determine the best estimate of losses incurred 
to calculate loan loss reserves for the multifamily loan portfolio  we also use models  evaluate certain larger loans for impairment  and review repayment prospects and collateral values underlying individual loans 
we regularly evaluate the underlying estimates and models we use when determining the loan loss reserves and update our assumptions to reflect our historical experience and current view of economic factors 
inputs used by those models are regularly updated for changes in the underlying data  assumptions  valuation inputs  or market conditions 
determining the adequacy of the loan loss reserves is a complex process that is subject to numerous estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment about matters that involve a high degree of subjectivity 
key estimates and assumptions that impact our loan loss reserves include loss severity trends  default experience  expected proceeds from credit enhancements  collateral valuation  loss mitigation activities  counterparty credit of mortgage insurers and seller servicers  and identification and impact assessment of macroeconomic factors  such as home price declines  rental rates and unemployment rates 
no single statistic or measurement determines the adequacy of the loan loss reserves 
changes in one or more of the estimates or assumptions used to calculate the loan loss reserves could have a material impact on the loan loss reserves and provision for credit losses 
this management estimate is inherently more difficult to predict due to the absence of historical freddie mac 
table of contents precedents relative to the current environment 
as such  during  management judgment was an increasingly significant aspect of the loan loss reserve estimation process 
we believe the level of our loan loss reserves is reasonable based on internal reviews of the factors and methodologies used 
a management committee reviews the overall level of loan loss reserves  as well as the factors and methodologies that give rise to the estimate  and submits the best point estimate for review by senior management 
application of the static effective yield method to amortize the guarantee obligation we amortize our guarantee obligation of our single family guarantee and multifamily segments into income on guarantee obligation in our consolidated statements of operations under the static effective yield method 
the static effective yield is calculated and fixed at inception of the guarantee based on forecasted unpaid principal balances 
the static effective yield is evaluated and adjusted when significant changes in economic events cause a shift in the pattern of our economic release from risk 
for example  certain market environments may lead to sharp and sustained changes in home prices or prepayments of mortgages  leading to the need for an adjustment in the static effective yield for specific mortgage pools underlying the guarantee 
when a change is required  a cumulative catch up adjustment  which could be significant in a given period  is recognized and a new static effective yield is used to determine our guarantee obligation amortization 
these cumulative catch up adjustments  which may be positive or negative  are recorded to provide a pattern of revenue recognition that is consistent with our economic release from risk and the timing of the recognition of losses on the pools of mortgage loans we guarantee 
see consolidated results of operations non interest income loss income on guarantee obligation for further information 
application of the effective interest method as described in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements  we use the effective interest method in our investments segment to a recognize interest income on our investments in debt securities  and b amortize related deferred items into interest income 
the application of the effective interest method requires us to estimate the effective yield at each period end using our current estimate of future prepayments 
determination of these estimates requires significant judgment  as expected prepayment behavior is inherently uncertain 
estimates of future prepayments are derived from market sources and our internal prepayment models 
judgment is involved in making initial determinations about prepayment expectations and in updating those expectations over time in response to changes in market conditions  such as interest rates and other macroeconomic factors 
see the discussion of market risks and our interest rate sensitivity measures under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and other market risks 
we believe that our current estimates of future prepayments are reasonable and comparable to those used by other market participants 
impairment recognition on investments in securities we recognize impairment losses on available for sale securities through gains losses on investment activity in our consolidated statements of operations when we have concluded that a decrease in the fair value of a security is not temporary 
prior to january   for securities accounted for under eitf  an impairment loss was recognized through gains losses on investment activity in our consolidated statements of operations when there was both a decline in fair value below the carrying amount and an adverse change in expected cash flows 
effective january   we elected the fair value option for available for sale securities identified as within the scope of eitf and record valuation changes to gains losses on investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations in the period they occur  including increases in value 
see valuation of a significant portion of assets and liabilities the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities for additional information 
determination of whether an adverse change has occurred involves judgment about expected prepayments and credit events 
further  we review all securities for potential impairment whenever the security s fair value is less than its amortized cost to determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the investments until a forecasted recovery 
this review considers a number of factors  including the severity of the decline in fair value  credit ratings  the length of time the investment has been in an unrealized loss position  loan level default modeling and the likelihood of sale in the near term 
while market prices and rating agency actions are factors that are considered in the impairment analysis  analysis of the underlying collateral based on loss severity  default  prepayment and other borrower behavior assumptions serves as an important factor in determining if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
implicit in this analysis is information relevant to expected cash flows such as collateral performance and characteristics that also underlies the other impairment factors mentioned above  and we consider other available qualitative information when assessing whether an impairment is other than temporary 
see note investments in securities table available for sale securities in a gross unrealized loss position to our consolidated financial statements for the length of time our available for sale securities have been in an unrealized loss position 
we recognize impairment losses when quantitative and qualitative factors indicate that it is probable that the security will suffer a contractual principal loss or interest shortfall 
we apply significant judgment in determining whether impairment loss recognition is appropriate 
we believe our judgments are reasonable 
freddie mac 
table of contents however  different judgments could have resulted in materially different impairment loss recognition 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements and consolidated balance sheets analysis mortgage related investments portfolio for more information on impairment recognition on securities 
in addition  we estimate that the future expected principal and interest shortfall on impaired available for sale securities will be significantly less than the probable impairment loss required to be recorded under gaap  as we expect these shortfalls to be less than the recent fair value declines 
the portion of the impairment charges associated with these expected recoveries is recognized as net interest income in future periods 
realizability of net deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the expected future tax consequences of existing temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax reporting basis of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
the realization of these net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income or upon our intent and ability to hold available for sale debt securities until the recovery of any temporary unrealized losses 
on a quarterly basis  our management determines whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
in so doing  our management considers all evidence currently available  both positive and negative  in determining whether  based on the weight of that evidence  it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
for more information about the evidence that management considers  see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
the consideration of this evidence requires significant estimates  assumptions and judgments  particularly about our financial condition and results of operations for several years into the future and our intent and ability to hold available for sale debt securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery 
as discussed in risk factors  recent events fundamentally affecting our control  management and operations are likely to affect our future financial condition and results of operations 
these events have resulted in a variety of uncertainties regarding our future operations  our business objectives and strategies and our future profitability  the impact of which cannot be reliably forecasted at this time 
as such  any changes in these estimates  assumptions or judgments may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
as described in note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  our management determined that  as of december   it was more likely than not that we would not realize the portion of our net deferred tax assets that is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
this determination was driven by recent events and the resulting uncertainties that existed as of december  that are discussed in risk factors 
as a result  we recorded an additional valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets at december  the valuation allowance recorded in the third and fourth quarters had a material effect on our financial position as of december  and our results of operations for it is possible that  in future periods  the uncertainties regarding our future operations and profitability could be resolved such that it could become more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets would be realized due to the generation of sufficient taxable income 
if that were to occur  our management would assess the need for a reduction of the valuation allowance  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period of the reduction 
also  as described in note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  our management has determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary for the portion of our net deferred tax assets that is dependent upon our intent and ability to hold available for sale debt securities until the recovery of any temporary unrealized losses 
these temporary unrealized losses have only impacted comprehensive income  not income from continuing operations or our taxable income  nor will they impact income from continuing operations or taxable income if they are held to maturity 
as such  the realization of this deferred tax asset is not dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income but is instead dependent on our intent and ability to hold these securities until recovery  which may be at maturity 
the conclusion by management that these unrealized losses are temporary and that we have the intent and ability to hold these securities until recovery requires significant estimates  assumptions and judgments  as described above in impairment recognition on investments in securities 
any changes in these estimates  assumptions or judgments in future periods may result in the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  which would result in some of this deferred tax asset not being realized and may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations

table of contents credit risks our total mortgage portfolio is subject primarily to two types of credit risk mortgage credit risk and institutional credit risk 
mortgage credit risk is the risk that a borrower will fail to make timely payments on a mortgage or security we own or guarantee 
we are exposed to mortgage credit risk on our total mortgage portfolio because we either hold the mortgage assets or have guaranteed mortgages in connection with the issuance of a pc  structured security or other borrower performance commitment 
institutional credit risk is the risk that a counterparty that has entered into a business contract or arrangement with us will fail to meet its obligations 
mortgage and credit market conditions deteriorated in the second half of and more rapidly throughout these conditions were brought about by a number of factors  which have increased our exposure to both mortgage credit and institutional credit risks 
factors negatively affecting the mortgage and credit markets during included changes in other financial institutions underwriting standards which allowed for new higher risk mortgage products in and that resulted in historically high default rates  increases in unemployment  declines in home prices nationally  higher incidence of institutional insolvencies  higher levels of foreclosures and delinquencies  significant volatility  significantly lower levels of liquidity in institutional credit markets  wider credit spreads  rating agency downgrades of mortgage related securities or counterparties  and declines in rental rates and increased vacancy rates affecting multifamily housing operators and investors 
mortgage credit risk mortgage credit risk is primarily influenced by the credit profile of the borrower on the mortgage  the features of the mortgage itself  the type of property securing the mortgage  home price trends and the general economy 
to manage our mortgage credit risk  we focus on three key areas underwriting requirements and quality control standards  portfolio diversification  and portfolio management activities  including loss mitigation and the use of credit enhancements 
all mortgages that we purchase or guarantee have an inherent risk of default 
we vary our guarantee fee pricing relative to differing levels of mortgage credit risk 
the appointment of fhfa as conservator and the conservator s subsequent directive that we provide increased support to the mortgage market has affected guarantee pricing decisions by limiting our ability to adjust our fees for current expectations of credit risk  and will likely continue to do so 
we also seek to manage the underlying risk by using our underwriting and quality control processes 
our underwriting process evaluates mortgage loans and the borrowers ability to repay the loans using several critical risk characteristics  including the borrower s credit score  the borrower s monthly income relative to debt payments  ltv ratio  type of mortgage product and occupancy type 
see business regulation and supervision federal housing finance agency housing goals and home purchase subgoals for a discussion of factors that may cause us to purchase loans that do not meet our normal standards 
mortgage market background we have been significantly adversely affected by deteriorating conditions in the single family housing and mortgage markets during and in recent years  financial institutions significantly increased mortgage lending and securitization of certain higher risk mortgage products  such as subprime  option arm and alt a loans  and these loans comprised a much larger proportion of origination and securitization issuance volumes during and  as compared to prior years 
during this time  we increased our participation in the market for these products through our purchases of non agency mortgage related securities  which we hold in our mortgage related investments portfolio and  to a lesser extent  through our guarantee activities 
our expanded participation in these products was driven by a combination of competing objectives  including meeting our affordable housing goals  serving our customers and generating returns for investors 
the exposure to mortgage credit risk for a number of financial institutions also increased with the expanding use of leverage as well as mortgage credit derivative products 
we believe these products  such as credit default swaps  or cds  and collateralized debt obligations  or cdos  obscured the distribution of risk among market participants 
moreover  the complexity of such instruments made the overall risk exposure of the financial institutions using them less apparent 
we believe concerns about counterparties with significant exposures associated with these instruments further reduced transaction volumes and new issuances of non agency mortgage related securities during the table below illustrates the size of mortgage origination and securitization activities during the past three years relative to our own market participation 
we have not presented cds or cdo market statistics  since there is no reliable data that illustrates these exposures and we have not significantly participated in the market for these products

as shown above  single family mortgage loan purchases for our total mortgage portfolio comprised approximately  and of total mortgage originations during  and  respectively 
the trend of increasing market share reflects the greater composition of gse conforming mortgage loan originations during and resulting from the tightening of underwriting for mortgage credit by financial institutions and the fact that most non agency institutions have sharply curtailed their securitization activities 
issuances of non agency mortgage related securities backed by subprime mortgages increased significantly during and  as compared to prior years 
as shown above  our purchases of non agency mortgage related securities represented approximately of the total issuance of these securities during both and during  the market for issuances of non agency mortgage related securities has been nearly non existent 
as a result of greater variability in underwriting standards during and  the deterioration in mortgage performance has varied considerably across different market segments 
although prior to we increased our participation in the market for newer and higher risk mortgage products  our single family mortgage portfolio has been generally subject to more consistent underwriting standards and thus  our portfolio has performed better relative to most market participants and market segments 
however  as discussed in consolidated balance sheets analysis mortgage related investments portfolio  we are exposed to the performance of these other participants and segments through our investments in non agency mortgage related securities 
macroeconomic conditions deteriorated during  which affected the performance of all types of mortgage loans 
both prime and non prime borrowers have been affected by the compounding pressures on household wealth caused by declines in home values  declines in the stock market  rising rates of unemployment  increasing food prices and fluctuating energy prices

represents the ratio of the number of loans that entered the foreclosure process during the respective quarter divided by the number of loans in the portfolio at the end of the quarter 
underwriting requirements and quality control standards we use a process of delegated underwriting for the single family mortgages we purchase or securitize 
in this process  we provide originators with a series of mortgage underwriting standards and the originators represent and warrant to us that the mortgages sold to us meet these requirements 
we subsequently review a sample of these loans and  if we determine that any loan is not in compliance with our contractual standards  we may require the seller servicer to repurchase that mortgage or make us whole in the event of a default 
we have also expanded our review of the underwriting of loans that we own or guarantee that default in order to assess the sellers compliance with the representations and warranties under our purchase contracts 
we provide originators with written standards and or automated underwriting software tools to assist them in comparing loans to our standards 
we use other quantitative credit risk management tools that are designed to evaluate single family mortgages and monitor the related mortgage credit risk for loans we may purchase 
these statistically based risk assessment tools increase our ability to distinguish among single family loans based on their expected risk  return and importance to our mission 
in many cases  underwriting standards are tailored under contracts with individual customers 
during  and  our seller servicers utilized our standard underwriting loan evaluation tool for  and  respectively  of loans purchased for our single family mortgage portfolio 
a significant portion of the mortgages we purchase are underwritten by our seller servicers using alternative automated underwriting systems or agreed upon underwriting standards that differ from our system or guidelines  which has increased our credit risk 
mortgage originators significantly tightened their credit standards during in response to declining market conditions  causing conforming  fixed rate mortgages to be the predominant product during we also made significant changes to our underwriting standards in which we expect will reduce our credit risk exposure for new business 
these changes include reducing purchases of mortgages with ltv ratios over  and limiting combinations of higher risk characteristics in loans we purchase  including those with reduced documentation 
in some cases  binding commitments under existing customer contracts have delayed the effective dates of underwriting adjustments for a period of months 
there has been a shift in the composition of our new issuances during to a greater proportion of higher quality  fixed rate mortgages and a reduction in our guarantees of interest only and alt a mortgage loans 
for example  alt a loans made up approximately and of our single family mortgage purchase volume during and  respectively  however  alt a mortgages made up approximately billion or of our single family mortgage purchase volume during in october  we announced that we will no longer purchase mortgages originated in reliance on reduced documentation of income and assets and mortgages to borrowers with credit scores below a specified minimum on and after march  the economic stimulus act of increased the conforming loan limit in certain high cost areas for single family mortgages originated from july  through december  to the higher of the applicable conforming loan limit  for a one family residence or of the median house price for the geographic area  not to exceed of the applicable base limit  or  for a one family residence 
we specified certain credit requirements for loans we accepted in this category  including but not limited to a limitations in certain volatile home price markets  b required borrower documentation of income and assets  c limits on cash out refinancing amounts and d a maximum original ltv ratio of 
we began purchasing and securitizing these conforming jumbo mortgages in april our purchases of these loans into our total mortgage portfolio for totaled billion in unpaid principal balance 
in november  fhfa announced that the base conforming loan limit for the gses will remain at the current level of  for a one family residence for with higher limits in certain high cost areas  as defined under the reform freddie mac 
table of contents act 
the reform act allows increases in our single family conforming loan limits beginning january   based on changes in the housing price index established by fhfa 
consistent with existing guidance  any decreases in this index would be accumulated and would be used to offset any future increases in the housing price index  so that loan limits do not decrease from year to year 
in high cost areas where of the median house price exceeds the otherwise applicable conforming loan limit the reform act sets the loan limits at the lesser of i of the median house price for the area or ii of the conforming loan limit  currently  for a one family residence 
on february   president obama signed the recovery act  which provides that  for mortgages originated in calendar year  the loan limits for high cost areas will be the higher of the limit determined under the reform act and the limit determined under the economic stimulus act of for our purchases of multifamily mortgage loans  we significantly rely on an intensive pre purchase underwriting process and  in some cases  credit enhancements 
our underwriting process includes assessments of the local market  the borrower  the property manager  the property s historical and projected financial performance and the property s physical condition  which may include a physical inspection of the property 
we rely for the most part on third party appraisals and environmental and engineering reports 
we have also engaged third party underwriters to underwrite mortgages on our behalf 
during  we began a program of delegated underwriting for certain multifamily mortgages we purchase or securitize and we expanded our use of delegated underwriting during credit enhancements our charter generally requires that single family mortgages with ltv ratios above at the time of purchase must be covered by one of the following a mortgage insurance from a mortgage insurer that we determine is qualified on the portion above of the outstanding balance  b a seller s agreement to repurchase or replace any mortgage in default for such period and under such circumstances as we may require  or c retention by the seller of at least a participation interest in the mortgages 
in addition  for some mortgage loans  we elect to share the default risk by transferring a portion of that risk to various third parties through a variety of other credit enhancements 
in many cases  the lender s or third party s risk is limited to a specific level of losses at the time the credit enhancement becomes effective 
in addition  on february   the obama administration announced the hasp  which includes an initiative that will allow mortgages owned or guaranteed by us to be refinanced without obtaining credit enhancement beyond that already in place for that loan 
for more information  see executive summary conservatorship 
at december  and  credit enhanced mortgages and mortgage related securities represented approximately and of the  billion and  billion  respectively  of the unpaid principal balance of our total mortgage portfolio  excluding non freddie mac guaranteed mortgage related securities  our structured transactions and that portion of issued structured securities that is backed by ginnie mae certificates 
we exclude non freddie mac guaranteed mortgage related securities because they expose us primarily to institutional credit risk 
we exclude that portion of structured securities backed by ginnie mae certificates because the incremental credit risk to which we are exposed is considered insignificant 
although many of our structured transactions are credit enhanced  we present the credit enhancement coverage information separately in table below due to the use of subordination in many of the securities structures 
see consolidated balance sheets analysis mortgage related investments portfolio for additional information on our investments in non freddie mac mortgage related securities 
we recognized recovery proceeds of million  million and million in  and  respectively  under our primary and pool mortgage insurance policies and other credit enhancements as discussed below related to our single family mortgage portfolio 
our ability and desire to expand or reduce the portion of our total mortgage portfolio covered by credit enhancements will depend on our evaluation of the credit quality of new business purchase opportunities  the risk profile of our portfolio and the future availability of effective credit enhancements at prices that permit an attractive return 
while the use of credit enhancements reduces our exposure to mortgage credit risk  it increases our exposure to institutional credit risk 
as guarantor  we remain responsible for the payment of principal and interest if mortgage insurance or other credit enhancements do not provide full reimbursement for covered losses 
if an entity that provides credit enhancement fails to fulfill its obligation  the result could be a reduction in the amount of our recovery of charge offs in our gaap results 
primary mortgage insurance is the most prevalent type of credit enhancement protecting our total mortgage portfolio and is typically provided on a loan level basis for certain single family mortgages 
primary mortgage insurance transfers varying portions of the credit risk associated with a mortgage to a third party insurer 
the amount of insurance we obtain on any mortgage depends on our requirements and our assessment of risk 
we may  from time to time  agree with the insurer to reduce the amount of coverage that is in excess of our charter s minimum requirement 
most mortgage insurers increased premiums and tightened underwriting standards during these actions may impact our ability to serve borrowers making a down payment of less than of the value of the property at the time of loan origination 
in order to file a claim under a primary mortgage insurance policy  the insured loan must be in default and the borrower s interest in the underlying property must have been extinguished  such as through a foreclosure action 
the mortgage insurer has a prescribed period of freddie mac 
table of contents time within which to process a claim and make a determination as to its validity and amount 
it typically takes two months from the time a claim is filed to receive a primary mortgage insurance payment  however  due to our insurers performing greater diligence reviews on these claims to verify the original underwriting of the loans by our seller servicers is in accordance with their standards  the recovery timelines during have been extended by several months 
at december  and  in connection with pcs and structured securities backed by single family mortgage loans  excluding the loans that are underlying structured transactions  we had maximum coverage totaling billion and billion  respectively  in primary mortgage insurance 
other prevalent types of credit enhancements that we use are lender recourse and indemnification agreements under which we may require a lender to reimburse us for credit losses realized on mortgages  as well as pool insurance 
pool insurance provides insurance on a pool of loans up to a stated aggregate loss limit 
in addition to a pool level loss coverage limit  some pool insurance contracts may have limits on coverage at the loan level 
for pool insurance contracts that expire before the completion of the contractual term of the mortgage loan  we seek to ensure that the contracts cover the period of time during which we believe the mortgage loans are most likely to default 
at december  and  in connection with the single family mortgage portfolio  excluding the loans that are underlying structured transactions  the maximum amount of losses we could recover under lender recourse and indemnification agreements was billion and billion  respectively 
most mortgage insurers that provide pool and primary mortgage insurance coverage to us have been downgraded by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
we have institutional credit risk relating to the potential insolvency or non performance of mortgage insurers that insure mortgages we purchase or guarantee 
we manage this risk by establishing eligibility standards for mortgage insurers and by regularly monitoring our exposure to individual mortgage insurers 
our monitoring includes regularly performing analysis of the estimated financial capacity of mortgage insurers under different adverse economic conditions 
we also monitor the mortgage insurers credit ratings  as provided by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and we periodically review the methods used by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
to the extent there are downgrades in the credit rating of a mortgage insurer  we consider whether each downgrade and various other factors may indicate an increased likelihood that the insurer will not have the ability to pay our estimated exposure to covered losses 
see institutional credit risk mortgage seller servicers and mortgage insurers for further discussion about our seller servicers and mortgage loan insurers 
in order to file a claim under a pool insurance policy  we generally must have finalized the primary mortgage claim  disposed of the foreclosed property  and quantified the net loss payable to us with respect to the insured loan to determine the amount due under the pool insurance policy 
certain pool mortgage insurance policies have specified loss deductibles that must be met before we are entitled to recover under the policy 
pool insurance proceeds are generally received five to six months after disposition of the underlying property 
at both december  and  in connection with pcs and structured securities backed by single family mortgage loans  excluding the loans that are underlying single family structured transactions  we had maximum coverage totaling billion in pool insurance 
other forms of credit enhancements on our single family mortgage portfolio include government guarantees  collateral including cash or high quality marketable securities pledged by a lender  excess interest and subordinated security structures 
at december  and  in connection with pcs and structured securities backed by single family mortgage loans  excluding the loans that are underlying single family structured transactions  the maximum amount of losses we could recover under other forms of credit enhancements was billion and billion  respectively

charge offs are the amount of contractual principal balance that has been discharged in order to satisfy the mortgage and extinguish our guarantee 
includes billion and billion at december  and  respectively  that are securitized fha va loans  for which those agencies provide recourse for of qualifying losses associated with the loan 
the delinquency rates associated with single family structured transactions have increased significantly during compared to prior years 
although our credit losses to date have been mitigated to a large extent by credit enhancement  we have increased our provision for credit losses on these securities during since significantly less credit enhancement remains for these transactions 
our credit losses on structured transactions during are principally related to option arm loans underlying several of these transactions 
we are actively monitoring the credit performance of the loans underlying these structured transactions  particularly those originated during and  and we will continue to work with the servicers of these loans on their loss mitigation efforts in we also use credit enhancements to mitigate risk on certain multifamily mortgages and mortgage revenue bonds 
the types of credit enhancements used for multifamily mortgage loans include recourse to the mortgage seller  third party guarantees or letters of credit  cash escrows  subordinated participations in mortgage loans or structured pools  sharing of losses with sellers  and cross default and cross collateralization provisions 
cross default and cross collateralization provisions typically work in tandem 
with a cross default provision  if the loan on a property goes into default  we have the right to declare specified other mortgage loans of the same borrower or certain of its affiliates to be in default and to foreclose those other mortgages 
in cases where the borrower agrees to cross collateralization  we have the additional right to apply excess proceeds from the foreclosure of one mortgage to amounts owed to us by the same borrower or its specified affiliates relating to other multifamily mortgage loans we own 
at december  and  in connection with multifamily mortgage loans owned by us and underlying pcs and structured securities  but excluding structured transactions  we had credit enhancements as described above  which provide for reimbursement of default losses up to a maximum totaling billion and billion  respectively  excluding coverage under cross collateralization and cross default provisions 
other credit risk management activities to compensate us for unusual levels of risk in some mortgage products  we may charge upfront delivery fees above a base management and guarantee fee  which is calculated based on credit risk factors such as the mortgage product type  loan purpose  ltv ratio and other loan or borrower attributes 
in addition  we occasionally use financial incentives and credit derivatives in situations where we believe they will benefit our credit risk management strategy 
these arrangements are intended to reduce our credit related expenses  thereby improving our overall returns 
during  we implemented certain increases in delivery fees  which are paid at the time of securitization 
these increases included a basis point fee assessed on all loans purchased or guaranteed through flow business channels  as well as higher or new upfront fees for certain mortgages deemed to be higher risk based on product type  property type  loan purpose  ltv ratio and or borrower credit scores 
we negotiated increases in our contractual fee rates for pc issuances through bulk channels throughout in response to increases in market pricing of mortgage credit risk 
certain of our planned increases in delivery fees that were to be implemented in november  including an additional basis point increase in fees for flow business purchases  were cancelled 
during the fourth quarter of  we made significant changes to delivery fee schedules that take effect for settlements on and after january   including increasing certain delivery fees based on combinations of ltv ratios  credit scores  product types and other characteristics 
the appointment of fhfa as conservator and the conservator s subsequent directive that we provide increased support to the mortgage market has freddie mac 
table of contents affected guarantee pricing decisions by limiting our ability to adjust our fees for current expectations of credit risk  and will likely continue to do so 
we have also entered into credit derivatives on specified mortgage related assets that in most cases are intended to limit our exposure to credit default losses 
the fair value of these credit derivatives was not material at either december  or see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and other market risks use of derivatives and interest rate risk management types of derivatives credit derivatives for further discussion 
portfolio diversification a key characteristic of our credit risk portfolio is diversification along a number of critical risk dimensions 
we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics which may affect the default experience on our overall mortgage portfolio  such as product mix  ltv ratios and geographic concentrations 
mortgage portfolio characteristics as previously noted  we seek to manage credit risk in our single family mortgage portfolio by varying our pricing for our management and guarantee fees based on the risk we assume and by using our underwriting and quality control processes 
our underwriting process evaluates mortgage loans using several critical risk characteristics  such as credit score  ltv ratio and occupancy type 
table provides characteristics of our single family new business purchases in  and  and of our single family mortgage portfolio at december   and freddie mac 
table of contents table characteristics of single family mortgage portfolio purchases during the year ended portfolio at december  december  original ltv ratio range less than above to above to above to above to above total weighted average original ltv ratio estimated current ltv ratio range less than above to above to above to above to above total weighted average estimated current ltv ratio credit score and above to to to less than not available total weighted average credit score loan purpose purchase cash out refinance other refinance total property type unit units total occupancy type primary residence second vacation home investment total purchases and ending balances are based on the unpaid principal balance of the single family mortgage portfolio excluding structured securities backed by ginnie mae certificates and certain structured transactions 
structured transactions with ending balances of billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively  are excluded since these securities are backed by non freddie mac issued securities for which the loan characteristics data is not available 
original ltv ratios are calculated as the amount of the mortgage we guarantee including the credit enhanced portion  divided by the lesser of the appraised value of the property at time of mortgage origination or the mortgage borrower s purchase price 
second liens not owned or guaranteed by us are excluded from the ltv ratio calculation 
current market values are estimated by adjusting the value of the property at origination based on changes in the market value of homes since origination 
estimated current ltv ratio range is not applicable to purchases we made during  includes the credit enhanced portion of the loan and excludes any secondary financing by third parties 
including secondary financing  the total ltv ratios above were at both december  and credit score data is as of mortgage loan origination and is based on fico scores 
loan to value ratios an important safeguard against credit losses for mortgage loans in our single family non credit enhanced portfolio is provided by the borrowers equity in the underlying properties 
as discussed above in credit enhancements  our charter generally requires that single family mortgages with ltv ratios above at the time of purchase be covered by specified freddie mac 
table of contents credit enhancements or participation interests 
in addition  we employ other types of credit enhancements  including pool insurance  indemnification agreements  collateral pledged by lenders and subordinated security structures 
as shown in the table above  the percentage of loans with estimated current ltv ratios greater than has increased from at december  to of our single family mortgage portfolio as of december  as estimated current ltv ratios increase  the borrower s equity in the home decreases  which negatively affects the borrower s ability to refinance or to sell the property and purchase a less expensive home or move to a rental property 
if a borrower has an estimated current ltv ratio greater than  the borrower is underwater and thus is more likely to default than other borrowers  regardless of the borrower s financial condition 
for the approximately and of single family mortgage loans with greater than estimated current ltv ratios  the borrowers had a weighted average credit score at origination of and at december  and  respectively 
credit score credit scores are a useful measure for assessing the credit quality of a borrower 
credit scores are numbers reported by credit repositories  based on statistical models  that summarize an individual s credit record and predict the likelihood that a borrower will repay future obligations as expected 
fico scores are the most commonly used credit scores today 
fico scores are ranked on a scale of approximately to points 
statistically  consumers with higher credit scores are more likely to repay their debts as expected than those with lower scores 
at december   and  the weighted average credit score for our single family mortgage portfolio based on the credit score at origination was  and  respectively 
loan purpose mortgage loan purpose indicates how the borrower intends to use the funds from a mortgage loan 
the three general categories are purchase  cash out refinance and other refinance 
in a purchase transaction  funds are used to acquire a property 
in a cash out refinance transaction  in addition to paying off existing mortgage liens  the borrower obtains additional funds that may be used for other purposes  including paying off subordinate mortgage liens and providing unrestricted cash proceeds to the borrower 
in other refinance transactions  the funds are used to pay off existing mortgage liens and may be used in limited amounts for certain specified purposes  such refinances are generally referred to as no cash out or rate and term refinances 
other refinance transactions also include refinance mortgages for which the delivery data provided was not sufficient for us to determine whether the mortgage was a cash out or a no cash out refinance transaction 
the percentage of purchase mortgages in our single family portfolio acquisition volume has declined in each of the last three years 
due to continued declines in mortgage interest rates  current economic conditions  and the prevalence of modification programs we expect this trend will continue 
property type single family mortgage loans are defined as mortgages secured by housing with up to four living units 
mortgages on one unit properties tend to have lower credit risk than mortgages on multiple unit properties 
occupancy type borrowers may purchase a home as a primary residence  second vacation home or investment property that is typically a rental property 
mortgage loans on properties occupied by the borrower as a primary residence tend to have a lower credit risk than mortgages on investment properties or secondary residences 
geographic concentration because our business involves purchasing mortgages from every geographic region in the us  we maintain a geographically diverse single family mortgage portfolio 
while our single family mortgage portfolio s geographic distribution was relatively stable from to and remains broadly diversified across these regions  we were negatively impacted by material home price declines in each region during see note concentration of credit and other risks to our consolidated financial statements for more information concerning the distribution of our single family mortgage portfolio by geographic region 
mortgage product types product mix affects the credit risk profile of our total mortgage portfolio 
in general  year amortizing fixed rate mortgages exhibit the lowest default rate among the types of mortgage loans we securitize and purchase  due to the accelerated rate of principal amortization on these mortgages and the credit profiles of borrowers who seek and qualify for them 
in a rising interest rate environment  balloon reset mortgages and arms typically default at a higher rate than fixed rate mortgages  although default rates for different types of arms may vary 
the primary mortgage products within our single family mortgage portfolio are conventional first lien  fixed rate mortgage loans 
we did not purchase any second lien mortgage loans in or however  during the past several years  there was a rapid proliferation of mortgage product types designed to address a variety of borrower and lender needs  freddie mac 
table of contents including issues of affordability and reduced income documentation requirements 
while features of these products have been on the market for some time  their prevalence in the market and in our total mortgage portfolio increased in and despite an increase in adjustable rate and optional payment mortgages in the origination market in the last few years  mortgage loans and loans underlying our pcs and structured securities are predominately single family long term fixed rate products 
adjustable rate  interest only and option arm loans these mortgages are designed to offer borrowers greater choices in their payment terms 
adjustable rate mortgages typically have initial periods during which the interest rate is fixed 
after this initial period  which can typically range from two to ten years  the interest rate on the loan will then periodically reset based on a current market rate 
interest only mortgages allow the borrower to pay only interest for a fixed period of time before the loan begins to amortize 
option arm loans permit a variety of repayment options  which include minimum  interest only  fully amortizing year and fully amortizing year payments 
minimum payment option loans allow the borrower to make monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for the period 
the unpaid interest  known as negative amortization  is added to the principal balance of the loan  which increases the outstanding loan balance 
at a specified date  the payment terms are recast  which can result in substantial increases in monthly payments by the borrower 
there are approximately billion and billion of option arm mortgage loans  including some mta loans  which are a type of option arm  underlying our structured transactions as of december  and  respectively 
originations of interest only and option arm loans in the market declined substantially in our purchases of interest only mortgage products decreased in  representing approximately of our single family mortgage portfolio purchases compared to approximately in we did not purchase any option arm mortgage loans during and at december  and  interest only and option arm loans collectively represented approximately and  respectively  of the unpaid principal balance of our single family mortgage portfolio 
we also invest in non agency mortgage related securities backed by mta adjustable rate mortgage loans 
as of december  and  we had billion and billion  respectively  of non agency mortgage related securities classified as having mta loans as collateral

higher risk combinations combining certain loan characteristics often can indicate a higher degree of credit risk 
for example  single family mortgages with both high ltv ratios and borrowers who have lower credit scores typically experience higher rates of delinquency and default and higher credit losses 
however  our participation in these categories generally contributes to our affordable housing goals 
at december   approximately of mortgage loans in our single family mortgage portfolio were made to borrowers with credit scores below and had first lien  original ltv ratios  greater than at the time of mortgage origination 
in addition  as of december   of alt a single family loans we own or have guaranteed were made to borrowers with credit scores below at mortgage origination 
in prior years  as home prices increased  many borrowers used second liens at the time of purchase to reduce the ltv ratio on first lien mortgages 
including this secondary financing by third parties  we estimate that the percentage of first lien loans we own or have guaranteed that had total original ltv ratios above at origination was approximately at both december  and freddie mac 
table of contents subprime loans participants in the mortgage market often characterize single family loans based upon their overall credit quality at the time of origination  generally considering them to be prime or subprime 
there is no universally accepted definition of subprime 
the subprime segment of the mortgage market primarily serves borrowers with poorer credit payment histories and such loans typically have a mix of credit characteristics that indicate a higher likelihood of default and higher loss severities than prime loans 
such characteristics might include a combination of high ltv ratios  low credit scores or originations using lower underwriting standards such as limited or no documentation of a borrower s income 
the subprime market helps certain borrowers by broadening the availability of mortgage credit 
while we have not historically characterized the single family loans underlying our pcs and structured securities as either prime or subprime  we do monitor the amount of loans we have guaranteed with characteristics that indicate a higher degree of credit risk see higher risk combinations for further information 
in addition  we estimate that approximately billion and billion of security collateral underlying our structured transactions at december  and  respectively  were classified as subprime  based on our classification that they are also higher risk loan types 
on july   the american securitization forum  or asf  working with various constituency groups as well as representatives of us federal government agencies  updated the streamlined foreclosure and loss avoidance framework for securitized subprime arm loans  or the asf framework  which the asf originally issued in the asf framework provides guidance for servicers to streamline borrower evaluation procedures and to facilitate the use of foreclosure and loss prevention efforts in an attempt to reduce the number of us subprime residential mortgage borrowers who might default because the borrowers cannot afford the increased payments after the interest rate is reset  or adjusted  on their mortgage loans 
the asf framework is focused on subprime  first lien arms that have an initial fixed interest rate period of months or less  are included in securitized pools  were originated between january  and july   and have an initial interest rate reset date between january  and july  defined as subprime arm loans within the asf framework 
under the asf framework  subprime arm loans are divided into the following segments segment those where the borrowers are expected to refinance their loans if they are unable or unwilling to meet their reset payment obligations  segment those where the borrowers are unlikely to be able to refinance into any readily available mortgage product 
criteria to categorize these loans include a credit score less than and other criteria that would otherwise make the loan fha ineligible 
segment those where the borrowers are unlikely to be able to refinance into any readily available mortgage product and the servicer is expected to pursue available loss mitigation actions 
as of december   approximately million of mortgage loans that back our pcs and structured securities met the qualifications of segment  subprime arm loans 
however  we have not applied the approach in the asf framework and it has not had any impact on the off balance sheet treatment of our pcs and structured securities that hold loans meeting the related subprime arm loans criteria 
our loss mitigation approach for subprime arm loans under the asf framework is the same as any other delinquent loan underlying our pcs and structured securities 
refer to loss mitigation activities below for a description of our approach to loss mitigation activity 
we categorize non agency mortgage related securities as subprime generally if they were labeled as such at the time we purchased them 
at december  and  we held investments of approximately billion and billion  respectively  of non agency mortgage related securities backed by subprime loans 
these securities include significant credit enhancement  particularly through subordination  and and of these securities were investment grade at december  and  respectively 
during  these securities have experienced significant and rapid credit deterioration  which accelerated in the second half of see consolidated balance sheet analysis mortgage related investments portfolio for more information  including discussion of our evaluation of these securities for impairment 
alt a loans many mortgage market participants classify single family loans with credit characteristics that range between their prime and subprime categories as alt a because these loans have a combination of characteristics of each category or may be underwritten with lower or alternative documentation requirements relative to a full documentation mortgage loan 
although there is no universally accepted definition of alt a  industry participants have used this classification principally to describe loans for which the underwriting process has been streamlined in order to reduce the documentation requirements of the borrower or allow alternative documentation 
we principally acquire single family mortgage loans originated as alt a from our traditional lenders that largely specialize in originating prime mortgage loans 
these lenders typically originate alt a loans as a complementary product offering and generally follow an origination path similar to that used for their prime origination process 
in determining our alt a exposure in loans underlying our single family mortgage portfolio  we have classified mortgage loans as alt a if the freddie mac 
table of contents lender that delivers them to us has classified the loans as alt a  or if the loans had reduced documentation requirements  which indicate that the loan should be classified as alt a 
we estimate that approximately billion  or  and billion  or  of the loans underlying our single family pcs and structured securities at december  and  respectively  were classified as alt a mortgage loans 
in addition  we estimate that approximately billion  or  and billion  or  of our investments in single family mortgage loans in our mortgage related investments portfolio were classified as alt a at december  and  respectively 
for all of these alt a loans combined  the average credit score was  and the estimated current average ltv ratio  based on our first lien exposure  was 
the delinquency rate for these alt a loans was and at december  and  respectively 
we implemented several changes in our underwriting and eligibility criteria in to reduce our acquisition of certain higher risk loan products  including alt a loans 
as a result  our purchases of single family alt a mortgage loans for our total mortgage portfolio totalled billion in as compared to billion in beginning march   we are no longer purchasing loans underwritten using reduced documentation requirements 
we also invest in non agency mortgage related securities backed by single family alt a loans in our mortgage related investments portfolio 
we have classified these securities as alt a if the securities were labeled as alt a when sold to us or if we believe the underlying collateral includes a significant amount of alt a loans 
a total of billion and billion of our single family non agency mortgage related securities were backed by alt a and other mortgage loans at december  and  respectively 
see consolidated balance sheet analysis mortgage related investments portfolio for credit statistics and other information  including discussion of our evaluation of these securities for impairment 
delinquencies we report single family delinquency rate information based on the number of loans that are days or more past due and those in the process of foreclosure 
for multifamily loans  we report delinquency rates based on net carrying values of mortgage loans days or more past due and those in the process of foreclosure 
mortgage loans whose contractual terms have been modified under agreement with the borrower are not counted as delinquent for purposes of reporting delinquency rates if the borrower is less than days delinquent under the modified terms 
for purposes of reporting delinquency rates  we include all the single family loans that we own and those that back our pcs and structured securities for which we actively manage the credit risk 
consequently  we exclude that portion of our structured securities that are backed by ginnie mae certificates and our structured transactions 
we exclude structured securities backed by ginnie mae certificates because these securities do not expose us to meaningful amounts of credit risk due to the guarantee provided on these securities by the us government 
we exclude structured transactions because these securities are backed by non freddie mac securities and consequently  we do not service the underlying loans and do not perform primary loss mitigation 
many of these securities are significantly credit enhanced through subordination and are not representative of the loans for which we have primary  or first loss  exposure

the impact of the weak housing market was first evident during in areas of the country where unemployment rates had been relatively high  such as the north central region 
however  during  home prices declined broadly across the us and in many geographical areas  particularly in parts of the west  southeast and north central regions  where these freddie mac 
table of contents declines have been combined with increased rates of unemployment and weakness in home sales 
we experienced significant increases in delinquency rates throughout  which have been most severe in the west and southeast regions  particularly in the states of california  florida  nevada and arizona 
for example  as of december   single family loans in the state of florida comprised of our single family mortgage portfolio based on unpaid principal balances  however  this state made up approximately of the delinquent loans in our single family mortgage portfolio  based on unpaid principal balances 
to assist the greater numbers of borrowers becoming past due on their loans  we substantially increased our use of loan modifications during  which improves our delinquency rates to the extent that the borrowers remain current under the modified terms 
however  as the decline in economic conditions has been protracted  we have also experienced an increased incidence of redefault during on loans that have been modified 
if economic conditions do not improve  we expect these trends to continue in in addition to rising levels of home ownership in the us  our single family mortgage portfolio has been affected by the heavy refinance volumes that occurred during the last three years 
consequently  many of the loans in the portfolio were originated during that period 
at december   approximately of our single family mortgage portfolio consisted of mortgage loans originated in  or  which have experienced higher rates of delinquency in the earlier years of their terms as compared to our historical experience 
we attribute this increase to a number of factors  including a an environment of decreasing home sales and broadly declining home prices  b the expansion of credit terms under which loans were underwritten during and  and c an increase in the origination and our purchase of interest only and alt a mortgage products that have higher inherent credit risk than traditional fixed rate mortgage products 
in addition  the delinquency rates for our mortgage loans originated in remain relatively high due to deteriorating home prices and increasing unemployment rates  despite having a greater proportion of higher quality  fixed rate mortgages

our delinquency rates for the single family mortgage portfolio including structured transactions were  and at december   and  respectively 
in support of our servicers who are increasing their efforts to assist troubled borrowers avoid foreclosure  we announced in july that we have extended the timeframe for completion of the foreclosure process in certain states 
in addition  many states  including florida  already have relatively long foreclosure processes 
as more fully discussed in loss mitigation activities below  we announced a streamlined modification program and suspended all foreclosure sales on occupied homes from november  through january  and from february  through march  these modification and suspension actions as well as the longer foreclosure process timeframes of certain states experiencing significant home price declines have  in part  caused our delinquency rates to increase more rapidly in  as loans that would have been foreclosed have instead remained in delinquent status 
until economic conditions moderate and fundamentals of the housing market improve  we expect our delinquency rates to continue to rise 
in general  our suspension or delays of foreclosure sales and any imposed delays in foreclosure by regulatory or governmental agencies will cause our delinquency rates to rise more rapidly 
the net effect on our results from implementation of broad based loan modification programs  such as the streamlined modification program and initiatives under the hasp  or the implementation of governmental actions or programs that expand the ability of delinquent borrowers to refinance into more affordable loans is uncertain 
these modification efforts may not reduce our eventual credit losses 
increases in delinquency rates occurred in all product types during  but were most significant for interest only and adjustable rate mortgage loans as well as all products underwritten with lower documentation standards that we categorize as freddie mac

table of contents loans purchased under financial guarantees as securities administrator  we are required to purchase a mortgage loan from a mortgage pool if a court of competent jurisdiction or a duly authorized federal government agency determines that our purchase of the mortgage was unauthorized and a cure is not practicable without unreasonable effort or expense  or if such a court or government agency requires us to repurchase the mortgage 
additionally  we are required to purchase all convertible arms when the borrower exercises the option to convert the interest rate from an adjustable rate to a fixed rate  and in the case of balloon reset loans  shortly before the mortgage reaches its scheduled balloon reset date 
for the years ended december  and  we repurchased billion and million  respectively  of such convertible arms and balloon reset loans 
the increase in these repurchases during was primarily due to higher volumes of convertible arm loans we securitized during to  which was a period of generally declining mortgage interest rates 
as guarantor  we also have the right to purchase mortgages that back our pcs and structured securities other than structured transactions from the underlying loan pools in certain circumstances  such as when they are significantly past due 
this right to repurchase collateral is known as our repurchase option 
effective december  we made certain operational changes for purchasing delinquent loans from pc pools  which significantly reduced the volume of our delinquent loan purchases 
see business our business and statutory mission our business segments single family guarantee segment pc trust documents for further information 
we may consider further changes to our practice concerning our election to repurchase single family mortgage loans during  in order to manage our capital and cash flow or other factors 
we record at fair value loans that we purchase in connection with our performance under our financial guarantees and record losses on certain loans purchased on our consolidated statements of operations in order to reduce our net investment in such loans to their fair value

 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  or sop excludes modifications involving capitalization  or addition  of past due amounts to the balance of the loan to return to current status during includes loans that have subsequently returned to current status under the original loan terms 
our net investment in loans purchased under our financial guarantees with reductions to fair value increased approximately in we purchased approximately billion in unpaid principal balances of these loans with a fair value at acquisition of billion during loans acquired in added approximately billion of purchase discount  which is comprised of billion that was previously recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as loan loss reserve and billion of losses on loans purchased 
we expect repurchase activity to increase in because the volume of our loan modifications is expected to significantly increase and many more of our delinquent loans will reach months of delinquency 
we expect that we will continue to incur significant losses on the purchase of delinquent or modified loans in however  the volume and severity of these losses is dependent on many factors  including the effects of our change in practice for repurchases and changes in fair values of delinquent or modified loans  which are impacted by regional changes in home prices 
as of december   the cure rates for delinquent or modified loans purchased out of pcs during and were approximately and  respectively 
the cure rate is the percentage of loans purchased from pcs under our freddie mac 
table of contents financial guarantee that have returned to current status  or have been paid off  divided by the total loans purchased from pcs under our financial guarantee 
our cure rates for loans purchased out of pcs during are not directly comparable to prior year rates due to the impact of our operational changes for purchasing delinquent loans made in december as a result of these operational changes  we have principally purchased loans that have undergone significant loss mitigation efforts  including those that have been modified 
consequently  we began purchasing an increasing number of foreclosed single family properties directly out of pc pools during as compared to the same period in although our operational change decreased the number of loans we would have otherwise purchased  it had no effect on our loss mitigation efforts nor does it change the ultimate credit losses upon resolution of the loan 
however  this operational change will continue to have a significant impact on our cure rate statistics for the loans we purchase under financial guarantees in  because delinquent loans  that prior to the operational change would have been purchased from the pools will now generally remain in the pools until they are modified  foreclosed or cure within the pc pool 
those mortgages that remained in the pools  and reperformed or proceeded to foreclosure during are not included in these cure rate statistics

rounded to hundreds of units 
as of december   the status of loans purchased under our financial guarantees above reflects an increase in the cure rate and a significant decrease in the percentage of those loans with reo and foreclosure alternative outcomes when compared to the status of delinquent loan purchases 
the increase in cure rate and decline in the percentage of those loans proceeding to foreclosure or foreclosure alternatives reflect the change in our operational practice with respect to purchases of delinquent loans discussed above 
we believe that the percentage of delinquent loans purchased during that remain delinquent should decline during since these cure rates do not fully reflect our current modification efforts due to the significant time required to complete the loan resolution process 
we believe that a quarterly and annual presentation of these cure rate statistics is important to illustrate both the lag effect of the resolution process inherent in delinquent loans as well as the poorer performance of delinquent loans that we purchased out of pc pools and modified during as compared to prior years 
we have increased our mitigation activity  including modifications where we agree to reduce the interest rate of the loan and to add delinquent amounts to the balance of the loan to bring the borrower current 
however  during we also experienced an increased incidence of loans returning to delinquent status  or that redefault  on loans that have been modified 
this is shown in the table above by comparing the cure rates as of the end of each respective period bottom half of the table with the cure rates as of december  we expect that continued freddie mac 
table of contents deterioration in home prices and home sales activity during will continue to negatively impact our cure rates and redefault rates on modified loans 
loss mitigation activities loss mitigation activities are a key component of our strategy for managing and resolving troubled assets and lowering credit losses 
our single family loss mitigation strategy emphasizes early intervention in delinquent mortgages and providing alternatives to foreclosure 
other single family loss mitigation activities include providing our single family servicers with default management tools designed to help them manage non performing loans more effectively and support fulfillment of our mission by assisting borrowers in retaining homeownership 
our seller servicers have a key role in the success of our loss mitigation activities 
the significant increases in delinquent loan volume and the deteriorating conditions of the mortgage market during placed a strain on the loss mitigation resources of many of our seller servicers 
a decline in the performance of any seller servicers in loss mitigation efforts could result in missed opportunities for modifications and an increase in our credit losses 
foreclosure alternatives are intended to reduce the number of delinquent mortgages that proceed to foreclosure and  ultimately  mitigate our total credit losses by reducing or eliminating a portion of the costs related to foreclosed properties 
our foreclosure alternatives include repayment plans  which are contractual plans to make up past due amounts 
they mitigate our credit losses because they assist borrowers in returning to compliance with the original terms of their mortgages 
loan modifications  which involve adding outstanding indebtedness  such as delinquent interest  to the unpaid principal balance of the loan or changing other terms of a mortgage as an alternative to foreclosure 
we typically examine the borrower s capacity to make payments under the new terms by reviewing the borrower s qualifications  including income and other indebtedness 
loan modifications include either a those that result in a concession to the borrower  which are situations in which we do not expect to recover the full original principal or interest due under the original loan terms  or b those that do not result in a concession to the borrower  such as those which add the past due amounts to the balance of the loan  extend the term or a combination of both 
the majority of our loan modifications completed during were those in which we agreed to add the past due amounts to the balance of the loan and did not make a concession to the borrower with respect to the outstanding balance of the loan 
however  the percentage of modifications with concessions to the borrower increased in and will likely continue to increase in forbearance agreements  under which reduced payments or no payments are required during a defined period 
they provide a temporary suspension of the foreclosure process to allow additional time for the borrower to return to compliance with the original terms of the borrower s mortgage or to implement another foreclosure alternative 
pre foreclosure sales  in which the borrower  working with the servicer  sells the home and pays off all or part of the outstanding loan  accrued interest and other expenses from the sale proceeds 
table presents the number of loans with foreclosure alternatives for  and table single family foreclosure alternatives december  number of loans repayment plans loan modifications forbearance agreements pre foreclosure sales foreclosure alternatives based on our single family mortgage portfolio  excluding structured transactions  and that portion of structured securities that is backed by ginnie mae certificates 
due to the higher rates of delinquency in our single family mortgage portfolio in  we significantly increased our use of loan modifications and repayment plans as compared to in august  we implemented a plan designed to increase the efforts of our servicers to execute foreclosure alternatives that included a an increase in fee compensation paid to servicers for each repayment plan  loan modification or pre foreclosure sale executed  b extending the time period for foreclosures in order to increase our ability to negotiate repayment plans and loan modifications in states with relatively fast foreclosure processes  and c expanding our guidelines on the types of loans eligible and conditions required for loan modification  thereby making this alternative available for a larger number of loans  including those previously modified 
also during the third quarter of  in order to accelerate our loss mitigation efforts  we implemented a trial program to proactively offer modifications on some of the delinquent loans underlying our pcs that we identified using certain criteria that indicate they are more likely to proceed to foreclosure 
this trial modification program did not follow our typical freddie mac 
table of contents modification process  where we evaluate the borrower s capacity to meet the modified terms by reviewing qualifications such as income and other indebtedness 
this trial program primarily involved loan modification with concessions where we reduced the interest rate on the loans but not the outstanding balance 
the early results of this trial modification program indicate a significantly higher incidence of redefault on modified loans than our historical experience 
during the fourth quarter of  large scale loss mitigation programs through the use of modifications that freeze or reduce the interest rate and sometimes reduce the principal balance of a troubled borrower s loan became increasingly prevalent in the market 
for example  in october  bank of america corporation announced a program for modifications of certain subprime and option arm loans originated by countrywide financial corporation prior to december  in october  fha implemented a program under the hope for homeowners program that enables refinancing of mortgages originated prior to january  for borrowers meeting certain criteria 
on november   our conservator announced a broad based streamlined modification program  involving freddie mac  fannie mae  fha  fhfa and seller servicers  which is intended to offer fast track loan modifications to certain troubled borrowers 
effective december   we directed our servicers to begin offering loan modifications to troubled borrowers under this program 
such borrowers may be eligible for modifications that would reduce the borrower s monthly payment by capitalizing past due payments  reducing interest rates  extending mortgage terms  forbearing principal  or a combination of these options 
the resulting modified loans are intended to provide these borrowers with an affordable monthly payment  defined as one where the borrower s monthly payment is no more than of the household s monthly gross income 
the streamlined modification program complements existing loss modification programs we utilize to avoid foreclosures 
in order to allow our seller servicers time to implement the streamlined modification program and provide additional relief to troubled borrowers  we temporarily suspended all foreclosure sales on occupied homes from november  through january  and from february  through march  we pursue loss mitigation options with delinquent borrowers during these temporary suspension periods  however  we also have continued to proceed with aspects of the foreclosure process 
in addition  we temporarily suspended the eviction process for occupants of foreclosed homes from november  through april  and announced an initiative to provide for month to month rentals to qualified former borrowers and tenants that occupy our newly foreclosed single family properties 
we expect that a significant number of delinquent loans eligible for modification under the streamlined modification program and the hasp will enter forbearance during the programs require a three month probationary period during which the borrower will be deemed in forbearance and must pay the reduced monthly payment 
after the third monthly payment is received by our seller servicers  the modification under these programs will become effective 
we anticipate that this will result in a temporary increase in our forbearance volume in addition to the expected rise in modifications with concessions during we expect to purchase a significant number of loans modified under these programs from pc pools 
purchases of these loans from pc pools will likely result in recognition of increased losses on loans purchased on our consolidated statements of operations during the success of modifications under our streamlined modification program and the hasp is dependent on many factors  including the ability to obtain updated information from borrowers  resources of our seller servicers to execute the process  the employment status and financial condition of the borrower and the intent of the borrower to continue to occupy the home 
in many cases  borrowers who have either overextended themselves with second liens on the property  experienced financial hardship or vacated the property will not be able to cure their delinquency through this program 
in early january  legislation was introduced into congress that is intended to stem the rate of foreclosures by allowing bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of mortgages on principal residences for borrowers in chapter bankruptcy 
if enacted  this legislation could cause bankruptcy filings to rise  potentially increasing troubled debt restructurings for mortgages in our single family mortgage portfolio and increasing our losses on loans purchased  which are recognized on our consolidated statements of operations 
for more information  see business regulation and supervision pending bankruptcy legislation and risk factors legal and regulatory risks legislation or regulation affecting the financial services  mortgage and investment banking industries may adversely affect our business activities and financial results 
on february   the obama administration announced the hasp  which includes an initiative to encourage modifications of mortgages for both homeowners who are in default and those who are at risk of imminent default  through various government incentives to both lenders and homeowners 
we expect that our efforts under the hasp will replace those under our streamlined modification program 
beginning march   we will suspend foreclosure sales for those loans that are eligible for modification under the hasp until our servicers determine that the borrower of such a loan is not responsive or that the loan does not qualify for a modification under hasp or any of our other alternatives to foreclosure 
for more information  see executive summary conservatorship 
we require multifamily seller servicers to manage mortgage loans they have sold to us in order to mitigate potential losses 
for loans over million  servicers must generally submit an annual assessment of the mortgaged property to us freddie mac 
table of contents based on the servicer s analysis of financial and other information about the property 
if a loan defaults  we may offer a foreclosure alternative to the borrower 
for example  we may modify the terms of a multifamily mortgage loan  which gives the borrower an opportunity to bring the loan current and retain ownership of the property 
because the activities of multifamily seller servicers are an important part of our loss mitigation process  we rate their performance regularly and conduct on site reviews of their servicing operations to confirm compliance with our standards 
non performing assets we classify loans in our single family mortgage portfolio that are past due for days or more seriously delinquent or whose contractual terms have been modified due to the financial difficulties of the borrower as non performing assets 
similarly  we classify multifamily loans as non performing assets if they are days or more past due  if collectibility of principal and interest is not reasonably assured based on an individual loan level assessment  or if their contractual terms have been modified due to financial difficulties of the borrower

beginning december  we changed our operational practice for purchasing loans from pc pools  which effectively delayed our purchase of nonperforming loans into our mortgage related investments portfolio 
this change  combined with higher delinquency rates  caused an increase in nonperforming loans underlying pcs and structured securities during see business our business and statutory mission our business segments single family guarantee segment pc trust documents for further information 
for more information about reo balances  see note summary of significant accounting policies and note real estate owned to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of nonperforming assets increased to approximately billion as of december   from billion at december   due to the continued deterioration in single family housing market fundamentals which has resulted in higher delinquency transition rates in the increase in delinquency transition rates  as compared to our historical experience  has been progressively greater for loans originated in and we believe this trend is  in part  due to greater origination volume of alt a and interest only mortgages  as well as an increase in estimated current and total ltv ratios for mortgage loans originated in those years 
in addition  the average size of the unpaid principal balance of non performing assets in our portfolio rose in until nationwide home prices stop declining and regional and national economies improve  we expect to continue to experience higher delinquency transition rates than those experienced in and an increase in our non performing assets

the amount of charge offs for credit loss performance is generally calculated as the contractual balance of a loan at the date it is discharged less the estimated value of the property acquired in disposition of the loan 
recoveries of charge offs primarily result from foreclosure alternatives and reo acquisitions on loans where a share of default risk has been assumed by mortgage insurers  servicers  or other third parties through credit enhancements

calculated as annualized credit losses divided by the average total mortgage portfolio  excluding non freddie mac mortgage related securities and the portion of structured securities that is backed by ginnie mae certificates 
our credit loss performance is a historic metric that measures losses at the conclusion of the loan and related collateral resolution process 
there is a significant lag in time between the implementation of loss mitigation activities and the final resolution of delinquent mortgage loans as well as the disposition of nonperforming assets 
our credit loss performance does not include our provision for credit losses and losses on loans purchased 
we expect our credit losses to continue to increase during  as market conditions  such as home prices and the rate of home sales  continue to deteriorate 
as discussed in loss mitigation activities  we implemented the streamlined modification program in late and announced several periods of suspensions in foreclosure sales of occupied homes 
our suspension or delay of foreclosure sales and any imposed delay in foreclosures by regulatory or governmental agencies will cause a delay in our recognition of charge offs and credit losses 
the execution and success of broad based loan modification programs  and the implementation of any governmental actions or programs that expand the ability of delinquent borrowers to refinance with concessions of past due principal or interest amounts  including legislative changes to bankruptcy laws  could lead to higher charge offs and increases of our credit losses

the impact of a national decline in single family home prices  decreasing home sales activity and tightening credit standards of most financial institutions during lessened the ability of homeowners exposed to deterioration in their financial condition to refinance their mortgages or sell the property for an amount above the outstanding indebtedness on the home 
increases in our single family reo acquisitions have been most significant in the states of california  arizona  michigan  florida and nevada 
the mortgage loans in west region states and florida have had higher average loan balances due to home price appreciation of the last several years  prior to the most recent decreases in home prices 
the west region represents approximately of the new reo acquisitions during  and based on the number of units  the highest concentration in that region is in the state of california 
california and florida have accounted for an increasing amount of our credit losses and comprised approximately of our total credit losses in as discussed in loss mitigation activities  we implemented the streamlined modification program in late and announced several periods of suspensions in foreclosure sales of occupied homes 
our suspension or delay of foreclosure sales and any imposed delay in foreclosures by regulatory or governmental agencies will cause a significant temporary decline in reo acquisitions and the rate of growth of reo inventory

table of contents loan loss reserves we maintain two mortgage related loan loss reserves allowance for losses on mortgage loans held for investment and reserve for guarantee losses at levels we deem adequate to absorb probable incurred losses on mortgage loans held for investment in our mortgage related investments portfolio and mortgages underlying our pcs  structured securities and other financial guarantees 
determining the loan loss and credit related loss reserves associated with our mortgage loans and pcs and structured securities is complex and requires significant management judgment about matters that involve a high degree of subjectivity 
this management estimate was inherently more difficult to perform during due to the absence of historical precedents relative to the current economic environment 
see critical accounting policies and estimates allowance for loan losses and reserve for guarantee losses and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further information

charge offs presented above exclude million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to loans purchased under financial guarantees and reflected within losses on loans purchased on our consolidated statements of operations 
recoveries of charge offs primarily resulting from foreclosure alternatives and reo acquisitions on loans where a share of default risk has been assumed by mortgage insurers  servicers or other third parties through credit enhancements 
consist primarily of a the transfer of a proportional amount of the recognized reserves for guarantee losses related to pc pools associated with non performing loans purchased from mortgage pools underlying our pcs  structured securities and long term standby agreements to establish the initial recorded investment in these loans at the date of our purchase  and b amounts attributable to uncollectible interest on pcs and structured securities in our mortgage related investments portfolio 
see consolidated results of operations non interest expense provision for credit losses  for a discussion of our to provision for credit losses 
credit risk sensitivity we provide a credit risk sensitivity analysis as part of our risk management and disclosure commitments with fhfa 
since we do not use this analysis for determination of our reported results under gaap  this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and may not be indicative of our actual results 
our credit risk sensitivity analysis assesses the estimated increase in the present value of expected single family mortgage portfolio credit losses over a ten year period as the result of an immediate decline in home prices nationwide  followed by a stabilization period and return to the base case 
we use an internally developed monte carlo simulation based model to generate our credit risk sensitivity analysis 
the monte carlo model uses a simulation program to generate numerous potential interest rate paths that  in conjunction with a prepayment model  are used to estimate mortgage cash flows along each path 
in the credit risk sensitivity analysis  we adjust the home price assumption used in the base case to estimate the amount of potential credit costs resulting from a sudden decline in home prices 
our estimate of this measure of sensitivity  after considering recoveries of credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance and our assumptions about home price changes after the initial decline  was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
however  our estimate of the actual decline in national average home prices based on our measure  which uses data on homes underlying our single family mortgage portfolio excluding structured transactions  was approximately for the year ended december  if home prices continue to decline in  more homeowners will find themselves owing more on their mortgage than their home is currently worth 
as borrower equity declines  our expectation of credit losses typically increases 
as such  we expect our credit risk sensitivity to further increase if home prices continue to decline

table of contents institutional credit risk our primary institutional credit risk exposure arises from agreements with mortgage seller servicers  mortgage insurers  issuers  guarantors or third party providers of credit enhancements including bond insurers  mortgage investors and originators  institutional counterparties of investments held in our cash and other investments portfolio and such investments managed for our pc trusts  and derivative counterparties 
a significant failure by a major entity in one of these categories to perform could have a material adverse effect on our mortgage related investments portfolio  cash and other investments portfolio or credit guarantee activities 
the recent challenging market conditions adversely affected  and are expected to continue to adversely affect  the liquidity and financial condition of a number of our counterparties 
for example  some of our largest mortgage seller servicers have failed  and others experienced ratings downgrades and liquidity constraints 
other of our counterparties may also experience similar problems 
the weakened financial condition and liquidity position of some of our counterparties  insurers and mortgage seller servicers may adversely affect their ability to perform their obligations to us  or the quality of the services that they provide to us 
consolidation in the industry could further increase our exposure to individual counterparties 
in addition  any efforts we take to reduce exposure to financially weakened counterparties could result in increased exposure to a smaller number of institutions 
during  we terminated our arrangements with certain mortgage seller servicers due to their failure to meet our eligibility requirements and we continue to closely monitor the eligibility of mortgage seller servicers under our standards 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a loss of billion related to the lehman short term lending transactions 
in addition  we had trading relationships or otherwise conducted business with lehman and several of its affiliates  which gave rise to various claims that we may have with respect to lehman and its affiliates 
see derivative counterparty credit risk and mortgage seller servicers for additional information about our exposure to lehman and its affiliates 
we also recognized increased provision for loan losses during as a result of institutional counterparties that failed to pay us or for which we have substantial uncertainty regarding their ability to perform on their obligations to us 
the failure of any other of our primary counterparties to meet their obligations to us could have additional material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
mortgage seller servicers we acquire a significant portion of our mortgage loans from several large lenders 
these lenders  or seller servicers  are among the largest mortgage loan originators in the us we are exposed to institutional credit risk arising from the insolvency or non performance by our mortgage seller servicers  including non performance of their repurchase obligations arising from the representations and warranties made to us for loans they underwrote and sold to us 
under our agreements with mortgage seller servicers  we have the right to request that mortgage seller servicers repurchase mortgages sold to us if those mortgages do not comply with those agreements 
as a result  our mortgage seller servicers repurchase noncomplying mortgages sold to us  or indemnify us against losses on those mortgages  whether we securitized the loans or held them in our mortgage related investments portfolio 
during and  repurchases of single family mortgages by our mortgage seller servicers without regard to year of original purchase were approximately billion and million of unpaid principal  respectively 
when a mortgage seller servicer repurchases a mortgage that is securitized by us  our guarantee asset and obligation are extinguished similar to any other form of liquidation event for our pcs 
however  when we have a seller servicer repurchase a noncomplying mortgage after we have repurchased it from the pc pool under our performance guarantee  we remove the carrying value of our related mortgage asset and recognize recoveries on loans impaired upon purchase 
the servicing fee charged by mortgage servicers varies by mortgage product 
in order to compensate our seller servicers for their servicing duties  we generally require them to retain a minimum percentage fee for mortgages serviced on our behalf  typically of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loans 
however  on an exception basis  we allow a lower minimum servicing amount 
the credit risk associated with servicing fees relates to whether  if a servicer is unable to fulfill its repurchase or other responsibilities  we could sell the applicable servicing rights to a successor servicer and recover  from the sale proceeds  amounts owed to us by the defaulting servicer 
previously  we believed that the value of those servicing rights generally provided us with significant protection against our exposure to a seller servicer s failure to perform its repurchase obligations 
under current market conditions  it is less likely that a buyer of servicing rights will be willing to assume the responsibility of the defaulting servicer for representations and warranties about the eligibility of the mortgages at the time of their sale to us 
this might necessitate that we accept a price for the servicing rights that does not cover all freddie mac 
table of contents obligations of the defaulting servicer or negatively affect our ability to recover amounts owed by the defaulting servicer 
we have contingency procedures in place that are intended to provide for a timely transfer of current servicing information in the event one of our major counterparties is no longer able to fulfill its servicing responsibilities 
however  due to the significant size of the mortgage servicing portfolios of some of our major customers relative to the servicing capacity of the market  the failure of one of our major servicers could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations in a timely manner 
in order to manage the credit risk associated with our mortgage seller servicers  we require them to meet minimum financial capacity standards  insurance and other eligibility requirements 
we institute remedial actions against seller servicers that fail to comply with our standards 
these actions may include transferring mortgage servicing to other qualified servicers or terminating our relationship with the seller servicer 
we conduct periodic operational reviews of our single family mortgage seller servicers to help us better understand their control environment and its impact on the quality of loans sold to us and the quality of the loan servicing activities performed on our loans 
we use this information to determine the terms of business we conduct with a particular seller servicer 
due to the strain on the mortgage finance industry during and  a number of our significant seller servicers have been adversely affected and have undergone dramatic changes in their ownership or financial condition 
in july  bank of america corporation completed its acquisition of countrywide financial corporation  and together these companies subsidiaries accounted for of our single family mortgage purchase volume during gmac mortgage  llc  or gmac  a subsidiary of residential capital llc  or rescap  is one of our seller servicers and comprised approximately of our mortgage purchase volume during rescap has recently made several announcements related to its weakened financial condition and concern regarding its ability to continue operations in the short term 
in december  gmac received additional capital from treasury under the tarp 
in september  washington mutual bank  which accounted for of our single family mortgage purchase volume during the nine months ended september   was closed by the office of thrift supervision 
the fdic was named receiver and the deposits  assets and certain liabilities of washington mutual s banking operations were acquired by jpmorgan chase bank  na we have agreed to jpmorgan chase becoming the servicer of mortgages previously serviced by washington mutual in return for jpmorgan chase s agreement to assume washington mutual s recourse obligations to repurchase any of such mortgages that were sold to us with recourse 
with respect to mortgages that washington mutual sold to us without recourse  jpmorgan chase has agreed to make a one time payment to us with respect to obligations of washington mutual to repurchase any of such mortgages that are inconsistent with certain representations and warranties made at the time of sale 
chase home finance llc  a subsidiary of jpmorgan chase  is also a significant seller servicer and when combined with washington mutual collectively provided of our single family mortgage purchase volume during in addition  wachovia corporation  the parent of our customers wachovia bank  na and wachovia mortgage  fsb  which together accounted for of our single family mortgage purchase volume during the nine months ended september   agreed to be acquired by wells fargo company in september wells fargo bank  na  a subsidiary of wells fargo company  is also one of our significant seller servicers and accounted for of our single family mortgage purchase volume during given the uncertainty of the current housing market we have entered into arrangements with existing customers at their renewal dates that allow us to change credit and pricing terms faster than in the past 
however  these arrangements  as well as significant customer consolidation discussed above  may increase the volatility of mortgage purchase and securitization volume from these customers in the future 
in july  indymac bancorp  inc announced that the fdic had been made a conservator of the bank  and we also have potential exposure to indymac for servicing related obligations  including repurchase obligations  which we currently estimate to be between to million 
although indymac has suspended its repurchases from us during its conservatorship  we are pursuing our ability to recover certain amounts from the assignment of mortgage servicing rights on mortgages currently serviced by indymac 
lehman and its affiliates also service single family loans for us 
we have potential exposure to lehman for servicing related obligations due to us  including mortgage repurchase obligations  which is currently estimated to be approximately million 
lehman has also suspended its repurchases from us since declaring bankruptcy 
our estimate of probable losses for exposure to seller servicers for their repurchase obligations to us is considered as part of our estimate for our provision for credit losses as of december  the estimates of potential exposure are higher than our estimates for probable loss as we consider the range of possible outcomes as well as the passage of time  which can change the indicators of incurred  or probable losses 
our current estimates of potential exposure to lehman and indymac have increased in  particularly the last half of the year 
we also consider the estimated value of related mortgage servicing rights in determining our estimates of probable loss  which reduce our potential exposures 
we believe we have adequately provided for these exposures in our loan loss reserves at december   however  our actual losses may exceed our estimates 
we manage the credit risk associated with our multifamily seller servicers by establishing eligibility requirements for participation in our multifamily programs 
these seller servicers must also meet our standards for originating and servicing freddie mac 
table of contents multifamily loans 
we conduct quality control reviews of our multifamily mortgage seller servicers to determine whether they remain in compliance with our standards 
mortgage insurers we have institutional credit risk relating to the potential insolvency or non performance of mortgage insurers that insure mortgages we purchase or guarantee 
we manage this risk by establishing eligibility standards for mortgage insurers and by regularly monitoring our exposure to individual mortgage insurers 
our monitoring includes regularly performing analysis of the estimated financial capacity of mortgage insurers under different adverse economic conditions 
we periodically perform on site reviews of mortgage insurers to confirm compliance with our eligibility requirements and to evaluate their management and control practices 
in addition  state insurance authorities regulate mortgage insurers and we periodically meet with certain state authorities to review market concerns

table of contents non freddie mac securities investments in non freddie mac issued securities expose us to institutional credit risk to the extent that servicers  issuers  guarantors  or third parties providing credit enhancements become insolvent or do not perform 
our non freddie mac mortgage related securities portfolio consists of both agency and non agency mortgage related securities 
agency mortgage related securities  which are securities issued or guaranteed by fannie mae or ginnie mae  present minimal institutional credit risk due to the prevailing view that these securities have a level of credit quality at least equivalent to non agency mortgage related securities rated aaa based on the s p rating scale or an equivalent rating from other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
see consolidated balance sheets analysis mortgage related investments portfolio for more information on institutional credit risk associated with our mortgage related investments portfolio  including information on higher risk components and an analysis of significant impairment charges we recorded during related to our investments in non agency mortgage related securities 
non agency mortgage related securities expose us to institutional credit risk if the nature of the credit enhancement relies on a third party to cover potential losses 
most of our non agency mortgage related securities rely primarily on subordinated tranches to provide credit loss protection and limit exposure to counterparty risk 
bond insurance  including primary and secondary policies  is an additional credit enhancement covering non agency securities held in our mortgage related investments portfolio or non mortgage related investments held in our cash and other investments portfolio 
primary policies are acquired by the issuing trust while secondary policies are acquired by us 
bond insurance exposes us to the risks related to the bond insurer s ability to satisfy claims

no remaining counterparty represents greater than of our total coverage outstanding 
we seek to manage institutional credit risk on non agency mortgage related securities by only purchasing securities that meet our investment guidelines and performing ongoing analysis to evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuers and servicers of these securities and the bond insurers that guarantee them 
to assess the creditworthiness of bond insurers  we may perform additional analysis  including on site visits  and similar due diligence measures 
in accordance with our risk management policies we will continue to actively monitor the financial strength of bond insurers in this challenging market environment 
in the event one or more of these bond insurers were to become insolvent  it is likely that we would not collect all of our claims from the affected insurer and it may impact our ability to recover certain unrealized losses on our investment portfolios 
to date  no bond insurer has failed to meet its obligations to us  however we recognized impairment losses during on securities covered by three of these insurers due to concerns over whether or not those insurers will meet our future claims

mortgage investors and originators we are exposed to pre settlement risk through the purchase  sale and financing of mortgage loans and mortgage related securities with mortgage investors and originators 
the probability of such a default is generally remote over the short time horizon between the trade and settlement date 
we manage this risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties and monitoring and managing our exposures 
in some instances  we may require these counterparties to post collateral 
freddie mac 
table of contents cash and other investments counterparties institutional credit risk also arises from the potential insolvency or non performance of other counterparties of investment related agreements 
instruments presented as cash equivalents  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell are generally arrangements with issuers or counterparties that are categorized as investment grade at the time of our purchase or initiation and are primarily short term in nature 
we regularly evaluate these instruments to determine if any impairment in fair value requires an impairment loss recognition in earnings  warrants divestiture or requires a combination of both 
to minimize counterparty risk of our on balance sheet assets  we intend to access government programs and initiatives designed to support the economic environment in general and the credit and mortgage markets in particular 
for example  we have adjusted our policies and exposure measurement methodology to reflect the fdic s added insurance coverage on principal and interest deposits up to  per borrower 
we also intend to structure future federal funds sold or other senior unsecured debt transactions to qualify for government guarantees under the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program  which will require that  among other things  the original maturities of these transactions exceed days 
because there currently is not a heavily traded market for federal funds sold transactions with terms over days  the impact to us of utilizing this structure is uncertain

exchange traded derivatives  such as futures contracts  do not measurably increase our counterparty credit risk because changes in the value of open exchange traded contracts are settled daily through a financial clearinghouse established by each exchange 
over the counter  or otc  derivatives  however  expose us to counterparty credit risk because transactions are executed and settled between us and the counterparty 
when our net position with an otc counterparty subject to a master netting agreement has a market value above zero at a given date ie  it is an asset reported as derivative assets  net on our consolidated balance sheets  then the counterparty could potentially be obligated to deliver cash  securities or a combination of both having that market value to satisfy its obligation to us under the derivative 
freddie mac 
table of contents we seek to manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk using several tools  including review of external rating analyses  strict standards for approving new derivative counterparties  ongoing monitoring of our positions with each counterparty  managing diversification mix among counterparties  master netting agreements and collateral agreements  and stress testing to evaluate potential exposure under possible adverse market scenarios 
on an ongoing basis  we review the credit fundamentals of all of our otc derivative counterparties to confirm that they continue to meet our internal standards 
we assign internal ratings  credit capital and exposure limits to each counterparty based on quantitative and qualitative analysis  which we update and monitor on a regular basis 
we conduct additional reviews when market conditions dictate or events affecting an individual counterparty occur 
all of our otc derivative counterparties are major financial institutions and are experienced participants in the otc derivatives market despite the increase in otc derivative counterparties that have credit ratings below aa

consists primarily of exchange traded contracts  certain written options and certain credit derivatives 
written options do not present counterparty credit exposure  because we receive a one time up front premium in exchange for giving the holder the right to execute a contract under specified terms  which generally puts us in a liability position 
over time  our exposure to individual counterparties for otc interest rate swaps  option based derivatives and foreign currency swaps varies depending on changes in fair values  which are affected by changes in period end interest rates  the implied volatility of interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and the amount of derivatives held 
our uncollateralized exposure to counterparties for these derivatives  after applying netting agreements and collateral  decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in uncollateralized exposure to aaa rated counterparties  which we typically do not require to post collateral given their low risk profile 
the uncollateralized exposure to non aaa rated counterparties was primarily due to exposure amounts below the applicable counterparty collateral posting threshold as well as market movements during the time period between when a derivative was marked to fair value and the date we received the related collateral 
collateral is typically transferred within one business day based on the values of the related derivatives 
as indicated in table  approximately of our counterparty credit exposure for otc interest rate swaps  option based derivatives and foreign currency swaps was collateralized at december  if all of our counterparties for these derivatives had defaulted simultaneously on december   our maximum loss for accounting purposes would have been approximately million 
during  an entity affiliated with lehman was our counterparty in certain derivative transactions 
upon lehman s bankruptcy filing  we terminated the transactions and requested payment of the settlement freddie mac 
table of contents amount  which the entity failed to pay 
we then exercised our right to seize collateral previously posted by the entity in connection with the transactions 
the collateral was insufficient to cover the settlement amount  leaving a shortfall of approximately million 
during  we recorded a million reduction to our derivative assets which represents an estimate of the probable loss on this transaction 
in the event of counterparty default  our economic loss may be higher than the uncollateralized exposure of our derivatives if we are not able to replace the defaulted derivatives in a timely and cost effective fashion 
we monitor the risk that our uncollateralized exposure to each of our otc counterparties for interest rate swaps  option based derivatives and foreign currency swaps will increase under certain adverse market conditions by performing daily market stress tests 
these tests evaluate the potential additional uncollateralized exposure we would have to each of these derivative counterparties assuming changes in the level and implied volatility of interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates over a brief time period 
as indicated in table  the total exposure on our otc forward purchase and sale commitments of million and million at december  and  respectively  which are treated as derivatives  was uncollateralized 
because the typical maturity of our forward purchase and sale commitments is less than days and they are generally settled through a clearinghouse  we do not require master netting and collateral agreements for the counterparties of these commitments 
however  we monitor the credit fundamentals of the counterparties to our forward purchase and sale commitments on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to meet our internal risk management standards 
at december   we had a large volume of purchase and sale commitments related to our mortgage related investments portfolio that increased our exposure to the counterparties to our forward purchase and sale commitment 
the majority of these commitments settled in january operational risks operational risks are inherent in all of our business activities and can become apparent in various ways  including accounting or operational errors  business interruptions  fraud  failures of the technology used to support our business activities and other operational challenges from failed or inadequate internal controls 
these operational risks may expose us to financial loss  interfere with our ability to sustain timely financial reporting  or result in other adverse consequences 
governance over the management of our operational risks takes place through the enterprise risk management framework 
business areas retain primary responsibility for identifying  assessing and reporting their operational risks 
our business processes are highly dependent on our use of technology and business and financial models 
while we believe that we have remediated material weaknesses in our information technology general controls  we continue to face challenges in ensuring that the new controls will operate effectively 
although we have strengthened our model oversight and governance processes to validate model assumptions  code  theory and the system applications that utilize our models  the complexity of the models and the impact of the recent turmoil in the housing and credit markets create additional risk regarding the reliability of our model estimates 
we continue to make significant investments to build new financial accounting systems and move to more effective and efficient business processing systems 
until those systems are fully implemented  we continue to remain more reliant on end user computing systems than is desirable 
we are also challenged to effectively and timely deliver integrated production systems 
reliance on certain of these end user computing systems increases the risk of errors in some of our core operational processes and increases our dependency on monitoring controls 
we are mitigating this risk by improving our documentation and process controls over these end user computing systems and implementing more rigorous change management controls over certain key end user systems using change management controls over tools which are subject to our information technology general controls 
in recognition of the importance of the accuracy and reliability of our valuation of financial instruments  we engage in an ongoing internal review of our valuations 
we perform analysis of internal valuations on a monthly basis to confirm the reasonableness of the valuations 
this analysis is performed by a group that is independent of the business area responsible for valuing the positions 
our verification and validation procedures depend on the nature of the security and valuation methodology being reviewed and may include comparisons with external pricing sources  comparisons with observed trades  independent verification of key valuation model inputs and independent security modeling 
results of the monthly verification process  as well as any changes in our valuation methodologies  are reported to a management committee that is responsible for reviewing and approving the approaches used in our valuations to ensure that they are well controlled and effective  and result in reasonable fair values

table of contents risk management and disclosure commitments in october  we announced our voluntary adoption of a series of commitments designed to enhance market discipline  liquidity and capital 
in september  we entered into a written agreement with fhfa that updated these commitments and set forth a process for implementing them 
a copy of the letters between us and fhfa dated september  constituting the written agreement is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this annual report on form k  and is available on the investor relations page of our website at www

the status of our commitments at december  follows description status periodic issuance of subordinated debt we will issue freddie subs securities for public secondary market trading that are rated by no fewer than two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
freddie subs securities will be issued in an amount such that the sum of total capital core capital plus general allowance for losses and the outstanding balance of qualifying subordinated debt will equal or exceed the sum of i of outstanding pcs and structured securities we guaranteed  and ii of total on balance sheet assets 
qualifying subordinated debt is discounted by one fifth each year during the instrument s last five years before maturity  when the remaining maturity is less than one year  the instrument is entirely excluded 
we will take reasonable steps to maintain outstanding subordinated debt of sufficient size to promote liquidity and reliable market quotes on market values 
each quarter we will submit to fhfa calculations of the quantity of qualifying freddie subs securities and total capital as part of our quarterly capital report 
every six months  we will submit to fhfa a subordinated debt management plan that includes any issuance plans for the six months following the date of the plan 
fhfa  as conservator of freddie mac  has suspended the requirements in the september agreement with respect to issuance  maintenance  and reporting and disclosure of freddie mac subordinated debt during the term of conservatorship and thereafter until directed otherwise 
fhfa has directed freddie mac during the period of conservatorship and thereafter until directed otherwise to make  without deferral  all periodic principal and interest payments on all outstanding subordinated debt  regardless of freddie mac s existing capital levels 
liquidity management and contingency planning we will maintain a contingency plan providing for at least three months liquidity without relying upon the issuance of unsecured debt 
we will also periodically test the contingency plan in consultation with fhfa 
we have in place a liquidity contingency plan  upon which we report to fhfa on a daily basis 
we believe this liquidity contingency plan satisfies the existing three month liquidity contingency plan under our written agreement with fhfa 
interest rate risk disclosures we will provide public disclosure of our duration gap  pmvs l and pmvs yc interest rate risk sensitivity results on a monthly basis 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and other market risks portfolio market value sensitivity and measurement of interest rate risk for a description of these metrics 
for the year ended december   our duration gap averaged zero months  pmvs l averaged million and pmvs yc averaged million

table of contents description status credit risk disclosures we will make quarterly assessments of the expected impact on credit losses from an immediate decline in single family home prices for the entire us we will disclose the impact in present value terms and measure our estimated losses both before and after receipt of private mortgage insurance claims and other credit enhancements 
since we do not use this analysis for determination of our reported results under gaap  this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and may not be indicative of our actual results 
our quarterly credit risk sensitivity estimates are as follows before receipt of credit enhancements after receipt of credit enhancements net present value  or npv npv ratio npv npv ratio dollars in millions at  bps  bps  bps  bps  bps  bps  bps  bps  bps  bps assumes that none of the credit enhancements currently covering our mortgage loans has any mitigating impact on our credit losses 
assumes we collect amounts due from credit enhancement providers after giving effect to certain assumptions about counterparty default rates 
based on single family total mortgage portfolio  excluding structured securities backed by ginnie mae certificates 
calculated as the ratio of npv of the increase in credit losses to the single family total mortgage portfolio  defined in footnote above 
the significant increase in our credit risk sensitivity estimates as of december   was primarily attributable to changes in our assumptions employed to calculate the credit risk sensitivity disclosure 
given deterioration in housing fundamentals  at the end of we modified our assumptions for forecasted home prices subsequent to the immediate decline 
we also modified our assumptions to reflect the increasing proportion of borrowers whose homes are currently worth less than the related outstanding indebtedness 
public disclosure of risk rating we will seek to obtain a rating  that will be continuously monitored by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization  assessing risk to the government or independent financial strength 
at march  and december   we no longer had a risk to the government rating from standard poor s 
on september   s p lowered our risk to the government rating to r regulatory supervision from a and withdrew the rating because of conservatorship 
at march  and december   our bank financial strength rating from moody s was e 
on september   moody s lowered our rating to e from d following our placement into conservatorship 
the bank financial strength rating scale ranges from a  highest  to e  lowest

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our mortgage related investments portfolio and credit guarantee activities expose us to three broad categories of risk a interest rate risk and other market risks  b credit risks  and c operational risks 
risk management is a critical aspect of our business 
see risk factors for further information regarding these and other risks 
we manage risk through a framework that recognizes primary risk ownership and management by our business areas 
within this framework  our executive management responsible for independent risk oversight monitors performance against our risk management strategies and established risk limits and reporting thresholds  identifies and assesses potential issues and provides oversight regarding changes in business processes and activities 
see md a credit risks and md a operational risks for a discussion of credit risks and operational risks and see controls and procedures for a discussion of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
interest rate risk and other market risks sources of interest rate risk and other market risks our mortgage related investments portfolio activities expose us to interest rate risk and other market risks arising primarily from the uncertainty as to when borrowers will pay the outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans and mortgage related securities held in our mortgage related investments portfolio  known as prepayment risk  and the resulting potential mismatch in the timing of our receipt of cash flows related to our assets versus the timing of payment of cash flows related to our liabilities 
for the vast majority of our mortgage related investments  the mortgage borrower has the option to make unscheduled payments of additional principal or to completely pay off a mortgage loan at any time before its scheduled maturity date without having to pay a prepayment penalty or make principal payments in accordance with their contractual obligation 
our credit guarantee activities also expose us to interest rate risk because changes in interest rates can cause fluctuations in the fair value of our existing credit guarantee portfolio 
we generally do not hedge these changes in fair value except for interest rate exposure related to net buy ups and float 
float  which arises from timing differences between when the borrower makes principal payments on the loan and the reduction of the pc balance  can lead to significant interest expense if the interest rate paid to a pc investor is higher than the reinvestment rate earned by the securitization trusts on payments received from mortgage borrowers and paid to us as trust management income 
with our adoption of sfas on january   we began to designate certain of our investments in pcs as trading assets  which provide an economic offset of our guarantee asset 
see note summary of significant accounting policies recently adopted accounting standards to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
the market environment was increasingly volatile throughout throughout  freddie mac adjusted interest rate risk models to reflect rapidly changing market conditions 
in particular  prepayment models were dynamically adjusted to more accurately reflect the current environment 
due to extreme spread volatility  we adjusted interest rate risk hedging methodologies to more accurately attribute oas spread volatility and interest rate risk 
the types of interest rate risk and other market risks to which we are exposed are described below 
duration risk and convexity risk duration is a measure of a financial instrument s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
convexity is a measure of how much a financial instrument s duration changes as interest rates change 
our convexity risk primarily results from prepayment risk 
we seek to manage duration risk and convexity risk through asset selection and structuring that is  by identifying or structuring mortgage related securities with attractive prepayment and other characteristics  by issuing a broad range of both callable and non callable debt instruments and by using interest rate derivatives and written options 
managing the impact of duration risk and convexity risk is the principal focus of our daily market risk management activities 
these risks are encompassed in our pmvs and duration gap risk measures  discussed in greater detail below 
we use prepayment models to determine the estimated duration and convexity of mortgage assets for our pmvs and duration gap measures 
expected results can be affected by differences between prepayments forecasted by the models and actual prepayments 
yield curve risk yield curve risk is the risk that non parallel shifts in the yield curve such as a flattening or steepening will adversely affect gaap stockholders equity deficit 
because changes in the shape  or slope  of the yield curve often arise due to changes in the market s expectation of future interest rates at different points along the yield curve  we evaluate our exposure to yield curve risk by examining potential reshaping scenarios at various points along the yield curve 
our yield curve risk under a specified yield curve scenario is reflected in our pmvs yield curve  or pmvs yc  disclosure 
volatility risk volatility risk is the risk that changes in the market s expectation of the magnitude of future variations in interest rates will adversely affect gaap stockholders equity deficit 
implied volatility is a key determinant of the value of an interest rate option 
since prepayment risk is generally inherent in mortgage assets  changes in implied volatility affect the value of freddie mac 
table of contents mortgage assets 
we manage volatility risk through asset selection and by maintaining a consistently high percentage of option embedded liabilities relative to our mortgage assets 
we monitor volatility risk by measuring exposure levels on a daily basis and we maintain internal limits on the amount of volatility risk exposure that is acceptable to us 
basis risk basis risk is the risk that interest rates in different market sectors will not move in tandem and will adversely affect gaap stockholders equity deficit 
this risk arises principally because we generally hedge mortgage related investments with debt securities 
we do not actively manage the basis risk arising from funding mortgage related investments portfolio investments with our debt securities  also referred to as mortgage to debt oas risk 
we generally hold a substantial portion of our mortgage assets for the long term and we do not believe that periodic increases or decreases in the fair value of net assets arising from fluctuations in oas will significantly affect the long term value of our mortgage related investments portfolio 
see md a consolidated fair value balance sheets analysis key components of changes in fair value of net assets changes in mortgage to debt oas for additional information 
we also incur basis risk when we use libor or treasury based instruments in our risk management activities 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that fluctuations in currency exchange rates eg  foreign currencies to the eg dollar will adversely affect gaap stockholders equity deficit 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk because we have debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  our functional currency 
we eliminate virtually all of our foreign currency risk by entering into swap transactions that effectively convert foreign currency denominated obligations into us dollar denominated obligations 
portfolio market value sensitivity and measurement of interest rate risk we employ a risk management strategy that seeks to substantially match the duration characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
to accomplish this  we employ an integrated strategy encompassing asset selection and structuring and asset and liability management 
through our asset selection process  we seek to purchase mortgage assets with desirable prepayment expectations based on our evaluation of their yield to maturity  oas and credit characteristics 
through this selection process and the restructuring of mortgage assets  we seek to retain cash flows with more stable risk and investment return characteristics while selling off the cash flows that do not meet our investment profile 
through our asset and liability management process  we seek to mitigate interest rate risk by issuing a wide variety of debt products 
the prepayment option held by mortgage borrowers drives the fair value of our mortgage assets such that the combined fair value of our mortgage assets and non callable debt will decline if interest rates move significantly in either direction 
we seek to mitigate much of our exposure to changes in interest rates by funding a significant portion of our mortgage portfolio with callable debt 
when interest rates change  our option to redeem this debt offsets a large portion of the fair value change driven by the mortgage prepayment option 
at december   approximately of our fixed rate mortgage assets were funded and economically hedged with callable debt 
however  because the mortgage prepayment option is not fully hedged by callable debt  the combined fair value of our mortgage assets and debt will be affected by changes in interest rates 
in addition  due to the deteriorating market conditions in  our ability to issue callable debt and other long term debt has been extremely limited 
if these conditions persist  our ability to manage our interest rate risk may be significantly adversely affected 
however  the federal reserve has been an active purchaser in the secondary market of our long term debt under its purchase program and spreads on our debt and our access to the debt markets have improved in early as a result of this activity 
to further reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates  we hedge a significant portion of the remaining prepayment risk with option based derivatives 
these derivatives primarily consist of call swaptions  which tend to increase in value as interest rates decline  and put swaptions  which tend to increase in value as interest rates increase 
with the addition of these option based derivatives  a greater portion of our prepayment risk has been hedged 
we also seek to manage interest rate risk by rebalancing the portfolio  primarily using interest rate swaps 
although we do not hedge all of our exposure to changes in interest rates  these exposures are subject to established limits and are monitored and controlled through our risk management process 
these limits are refined and updated from time to time 
see md a consolidated fair value balance sheets analysis key components of changes in fair value of net assets changes in mortgage to debt oas for further information 
pmvs and duration gap our primary interest rate risk measures are pmvs and duration gap 
pmvs is measured in two ways  one measuring the estimated sensitivity of our portfolio market value as defined below to parallel moves in interest rates portfolio market value sensitivity level or pmvs l and the other to nonparallel movements pmvs yc 
our pmvs and duration gap estimates are determined using models that involve our best judgment of interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
freddie mac 
table of contents accordingly  while we believe that pmvs and duration gap are useful risk management tools  they should be understood as estimates rather than as precise measurements 
while pmvs and duration gap estimate the exposure to changes in interest rates  they do not capture the potential impact of certain other market risks  such as changes in volatility  basis  prepayment model  mortgage to debt oas and foreign currency risk 
the impact of these other market risks can be significant 
see sources of interest rate risk and other market risks discussed above for further information 
definitions of our primary interest rate risk measures follow pmvs l shows the estimated loss in pre tax portfolio market value from an immediate adverse basis point parallel shift in the level of libor ie  when the yield at each point on the libor yield curve increases or decreases by basis points 
pmvs yc shows the estimated loss in pre tax portfolio market value from an immediate adverse basis point change in the slope up and down of the libor yield curve 
the basis point change in slope for the pmvs yc measure is obtained by shifting two year and ten year libor by an equal amount basis points  but in opposite directions 
libor shifts between the two year and ten year points are interpolated 
we calculate our exposure to changes in interest rates using effective duration 
effective duration measures the percentage change in price of financial instruments to a change in interest rates 
financial instruments with positive duration increase in value as interest rates decline 
conversely  financial instruments with negative duration increase in value as interest rates rise 
duration gap measures the difference in price sensitivity to interest rate changes between our assets and liabilities  and is expressed in months relative to the market value of assets 
for example  assets with a six month duration and liabilities with a five month duration would result in a positive duration gap of one month 
a duration gap of zero implies that the duration of our assets equals the duration of our liabilities 
as a result  the change in the value of assets from an instantaneous move in interest rates  either up or down  will be accompanied by an equal and offsetting change in the value of liabilities  thus leaving the fair value of equity unchanged 
a positive duration gap indicates that the duration of our assets exceeds the duration of our liabilities which  from a net perspective  implies that the fair value of equity will increase in value when interest rates fall and decrease in value when interest rates rise 
a negative duration gap indicates that the duration of our liabilities exceeds the duration of our assets which  from a net perspective  implies that the fair value of equity will increase in value when interest rates rise and decrease in value when interest rates fall 
multiplying duration gap expressed as a percentage of a year by the fair value of our assets will provide an indication of the change in the fair value of our equity resulting from a change in interest rates 
the convexity of a financial instrument measures the extent to which the duration or price sensitivity of an instrument changes for a change in interest rates 
as a result of convexity  actual changes in fair value from interest changes may differ from those implied by duration gap alone 
for that reason  we believe duration gap is most useful when used in conjunction with pmvs l 
the basis point shift and basis point change in slope of the libor yield curve used for our pmvs measures reflect reasonably possible near term changes that we believe provide a meaningful measure of our interest rate risk sensitivity 
our pmvs measures assume instantaneous shocks 
therefore  these pmvs measures do not consider the effects on fair value of any rebalancing actions that we would typically take to reduce our risk exposure 
the expected loss in portfolio market value is an estimate of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and derivatives on a pre tax basis 
when we calculate the expected loss in portfolio market value and duration gap  we also take into account the cash flows related to certain credit guarantee related items  including net buy ups and expected gains or losses due to net interest from float 
in making these calculations  we do not consider the sensitivity to interest rate changes of the following assets and liabilities credit guarantee portfolio 
we do not consider the sensitivity of the fair value of the credit guarantee portfolio to changes in interest rates except for the guarantee related items mentioned above ie  net buy ups and float  because we believe the expected benefits from replacement business provide an adequate hedge against interest rate changes over time 
other assets with minimal interest rate sensitivity 
we do not include other assets  primarily non financial instruments such as fixed assets and reo  because we estimate their impact on pmvs and duration gap to be minimal 
limitations of market risk measures there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate exposure to changes in market interest rates 
our sensitivity analyses for pmvs and duration gap contemplate only certain movements in interest rates and are performed at a particular point in time based on the estimated fair value of our existing portfolio 
these sensitivity analyses do not freddie mac 
table of contents incorporate other factors that may have a significant effect  most notably expected future business activities and strategic actions that management may take to manage interest rate risk 
in addition  when market conditions change rapidly and dramatically  as they have since  the assumptions that we use in our models for our sensitivity analyses may not keep pace with changing conditions 
as such  these analyses are not intended to provide precise forecasts of the effect a change in market interest rates would have on the estimated fair value of our net assets 
pmvs results table provides estimated point in time pmvs l and pmvs yc results at december  and table also provides pmvs l estimates assuming an immediate basis point shift in the libor yield curve 
because of a significant drop in mortgage rates during  the prepayment option risk or negative convexity of our mortgage assets decreased significantly as compared to accordingly  as shown in table  the pmvs l results are significantly lower in as compared to in both a and basis points shift in the libor curve

use of derivatives and interest rate risk management use of derivatives we use derivatives primarily to hedge forecasted issuances of debt and synthetically create callable and non callable funding  regularly adjust or rebalance our funding mix in order to more closely match changes in the interest rate characteristics of our mortgage assets  and hedge foreign currency exposure see sources of interest rate risk and other market risks foreign currency risk 
hedge forecasted debt issuances and create synthetic funding we typically commit to purchase mortgage investments on an opportunistic basis for a future settlement  typically ranging from two weeks to three months after the date of the commitment 
to facilitate larger and more predictable debt issuances that contribute to lower funding costs  we use interest rate derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate risk exposure from the time we commit to purchase a mortgage to the time the related debt is issued 
we also use derivatives to synthetically create the substantive economic equivalent of various debt funding structures 
for example  the combination of a series of short term debt issuances over a defined period and a pay fixed swap with the same maturity as the last debt issuance is the substantive economic equivalent of a long term fixed rate debt instrument of comparable maturity 
similarly  the combination of non callable debt and a call swaption  or option to enter into a receive fixed swap  with the same maturity as the non callable debt  is the substantive economic equivalent of callable debt 
these derivatives strategies increase our funding flexibility and allow us to better match asset and liability cash flows  often reducing overall funding costs 
freddie mac 
table of contents adjust funding mix we generally use interest rate swaps to mitigate contractual funding mismatches between our assets and liabilities 
we also use swaptions and other option based derivatives to adjust the contractual funding of our debt in response to changes in the expected lives of mortgage related assets in our mortgage related investments portfolio 
as market conditions dictate  we take rebalancing actions to keep our interest rate risk exposure within management set limits 
in a declining interest rate environment  we typically enter into receive fixed swaps or purchase treasury based derivatives to shorten the duration of our funding to offset the declining duration of our mortgage assets 
in a rising interest rate environment  we typically enter into pay fixed swaps or sell treasury based derivatives in order to lengthen the duration of our funding to offset the increasing duration of our mortgage assets 
types of derivatives the derivatives we use to hedge interest rate and foreign currency risk are common in the financial markets 
we principally use the following types of derivatives libor and the euro interbank offered rate  or euribor  based interest rate swaps  libor and treasury based options including swaptions  libor and treasury based exchange traded futures  and foreign currency swaps 
in addition to swaps  futures and purchased options  our derivative positions include the following written options and swaptions written call and put swaptions are sold to counterparties allowing them the option to enter into receive and pay fixed swaps  respectively 
written call and put options on mortgage related securities give the counterparty the right to execute a contract under specified terms  which generally occurs when we are in a liability position 
we use these written options and swaptions to manage convexity risk over a wide range of interest rates 
written options lower our overall hedging costs  allow us to hedge the same economic risk we assume when selling guaranteed final maturity remics with a more liquid instrument and allow us to rebalance the options in our callable debt and remic portfolios 
we may  from time to time  write other derivative contracts such as caps  floors  interest rate futures and options on buy up and buy down commitments 
forward purchase and sale commitments we routinely enter into forward purchase and sale commitments for mortgage loans and mortgage related securities 
most of these commitments are derivatives subject to the requirements of sfas swap guarantee derivatives we issue swap guarantee derivatives that guarantee the payments on a multifamily mortgage loans that are originated and held by state and municipal housing finance agencies to support tax exempt multifamily housing revenue bonds and b freddie mac pass through certificates which are backed by tax exempt multifamily housing revenue bonds and related taxable bonds and or loans 
in connection with some of these guarantees  we may also guarantee the sponsor s or the borrower s performance as a counterparty on any related interest rate swaps used to mitigate interest rate risk 
credit derivatives we have entered into credit derivatives  including risk sharing agreements 
under these risk sharing agreements  default losses on specific mortgage loans delivered by sellers are compared to default losses on reference pools of mortgage loans with similar characteristics 
based upon the results of that comparison  we remit or receive payments based upon the default performance of the referenced pools of mortgage loans 
in addition  we have entered into agreements whereby we assume credit risk for mortgage loans held by third parties in exchange for a monthly fee 
we are obligated to purchase any of the mortgage loans that become days delinquent 
in addition  we have purchased mortgage loans containing debt cancellation contracts  which provide for mortgage debt or payment cancellation for borrowers who experience unanticipated losses of income dependent on a covered event 
the rights and obligations under these agreements have been assigned to the servicers 
however  in the event the servicer does not perform as required by contract  under our guarantee  we would be obligated to make the required contractual payments 
derivative related risks our use of derivatives exposes us to derivative market liquidity risk 
see md a credit risks derivative counterparty credit risk for information on derivative counterparty credit risk 
freddie mac 
table of contents derivative market liquidity risk derivative market liquidity risk is the risk that we may not be able to enter into or exit out of derivative transactions at a reasonable cost 
a lack of sufficient capacity or liquidity in the derivatives market could limit our risk management activities  increasing our exposure to interest rate risk 
to help maintain continuous access to derivative markets  we use a variety of products and transact with many different derivative counterparties 
in addition to otc derivatives  we also use exchange traded derivatives  asset securitization activities  callable debt and short term debt to rebalance our portfolio 
we limit our duration and convexity exposure to each counterparty 
at december   the largest single uncollateralized exposure of our approved otc counterparties listed in md a credit risks table derivative counterparty credit exposure was related to an a rated counterparty  constituting million  or  of the total uncollateralized exposure of our otc interest rate swaps  option based derivatives and foreign currency swaps
