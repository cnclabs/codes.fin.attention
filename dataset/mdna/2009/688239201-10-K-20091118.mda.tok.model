all estimates referred to in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to the company s estimates as of november  recent acquisitions and dispositions since  the company has selectively pursued strategic acquisitions to enhance its product offerings and diversify its business 
the company has focused its acquisition strategy on providing a full range of products to customers in specialty vehicle and vehicle body markets that are growing and where it can develop strong market positions and achieve acquisition synergies 
acquisitions and dispositions completed during the past three fiscal years were as follows 
table of contents in fiscal  the company acquired jlg for billion  including transaction costs and the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired 
jlg is the leading global manufacturer of access equipment based on gross revenues 
the results of jlg s operations are included in the consolidated results of the company from december  the date of acquisition 
in fiscal  the company sold its european refuse collection vehicle business  geesink  to a third party for nominal cash consideration 
in spite of aggressive actions during the previous three fiscal years to restructure this business and return it to profitability  the business continued to incur operating losses for the first nine months of fiscal the company believes that its performance can be enhanced by redeploying its resources from geesink to support the company s other businesses 
the company has reflected the financial results of geesink as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
the company recorded a million non cash  pre tax gain on the sale 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reorganized geesink s european parent holding company and claimed a worthless stock and bad debt deduction  which resulted in a million tax benefit  of which million was included in discontinued operations 
in october  the company completed the sale of its interest in bai  the company s european fire apparatus and equipment business  to bai s management team for nominal cash consideration 
bai  which was included in the company s fire emergency segment  had sales of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this business did not meet the criteria to be recorded as assets held for sale as of september  as the company did not receive board of directors approval for the sale until october the company expects to record a small loss on the sale of bai in the first quarter of fiscal executive overview during fiscal  economies worldwide were impacted by what has come to be known as the great recession and credit crisis  as evidenced by lower residential and non residential construction  lower municipal and consumer spending  increased unemployment levels and lower manufacturing utilization 
the impact of the great recession and credit crisis on a number of the company s businesses was severe  ultimately leading to large non cash impairment charges described below 
for instance  the company s access equipment and domestic concrete placement products businesses each experienced sales declines of more than compared to the prior year 
in the midst of the greatest financial crisis since the great depression  the company s defense  domestic fire apparatus and airports products businesses delivered strong results  partially offsetting the downturns experienced in its other businesses 
during fiscal  the company took numerous actions to address the impact of the great recession and credit crisis on its businesses and aggressively pursued new business 
these actions  coupled with major defense contract wins  have significantly improved the company s outlook for fiscal as order intake for a number of its businesses deteriorated in fiscal  the company initiated additional cost reductions beyond actions taken in fiscal to partially offset the earnings impact of lower demand 
these actions included significant reductions in staffing  salary cuts for all domestic salaried employees  elimination of k contribution matches for most employees  periodic furloughs for a large percentage of employees and additional reductions in other discretionary spending 
the company also dramatically reduced capital spending 
late in fiscal  as a result of an improved financial outlook for fiscal  the company restored a portion of the compensation adjustments for those employees subject to reductions 
due largely to the downturn in the company s businesses with exposure to construction markets  the company amended its credit agreement in the second quarter of fiscal to avoid a potential financial covenant violation 
the amendment provided additional room under the financial covenants for the remainder of the term of the credit agreement 
in exchange for the changes to the financial covenants  the company incurred significant up front fees and increased interest spreads for the remaining term of the agreement 
the company also agreed  among other things  to limitations on capital expenditures  dividends  investments and acquisitions 
the company s board of directors subsequently elected to suspend the payment of dividends 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company also determined that goodwill and other long lived assets were impaired at certain of the company s reporting units  with the vast majority of the impairments concentrated in the access equipment segment 
this determination was based upon a sustained decline in the price of the company s common stock subsequent to the company s fiscal year end when its share price approximated book value  depressed order rates during the second quarter  which historically has been a strong period for orders in advance of the north american construction season  as well as further deterioration in credit markets and the macro economic environment 
following the completion of the impairment assessment  which was performed with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  the company recorded pre tax  non cash impairment charges of billion in the second quarter of 
table of contents fiscal these charges were driven by current projections and valuation assumptions that reflected the company s belief that the current recession would be deeper and longer than previously expected  that credit markets would remain tight and that costs of capital had risen significantly since the company last performed its annual impairment testing 
despite the requirement to record this impairment charge  the company continues to believe the long term prospects for its businesses remain strong 
in june  the dod awarded the company a sole source contract for  m atvs and associated aftermarket parts packages  valued at billion 
through november   the dod awarded the company an additional  m atvs and associated aftermarket parts packages  valued at billion 
unit deliveries under the contract are scheduled through april  with aftermarket parts packages to be delivered through may key attributes of the m atv include superior survivability and mobility required for the current conflict in afghanistan 
the m atv represents the company s first major entry into the market for vehicles used in small unit combat operations 
in fiscal  the company received orders totaling million to retrofit approximately  mrap vehicles originally manufactured by other companies for the dod with the company s patented tak independent suspension system 
the company is actively supporting the engineering and testing for retrofit installation of tak under other mrap models that could lead to additional tak sales in the future 
in august  the company completed a public equity offering of  shares of common stock  which included the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option of  shares of common stock  at a price of per share 
the company paid million in underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately million of offering expenses 
the net proceeds of the equity offering of approximately million  along with cash flow from operations  allowed the company to repay million of debt in fiscal  which substantially strengthened the company s capital structure 
in august  the dod awarded the company a contract valued at million for the production and delivery of  trucks and trailers under the us army s fmtv rebuy program 
the fmtv rebuy program is a five year requirements contract award for the production of up to  medium payload tactical trucks and trailers as well as support services and engineering 
competitors have filed protests with the gao regarding the award of the fmtv contract  and the dod has issued a stop work order on the program pending resolution of the protests  which is expected to occur in mid december the company believes the us army conducted a fair and objective source selection process and further believes that the contract award to the company should be upheld 
this contract would represent a significant expansion of the company s medium payload tactical truck business 
while not providing specific quantitative guidance for fiscal  the company expects fiscal financial results to be solidly profitable and significantly improved as compared to fiscal the company expects significant sales growth in fiscal in the defense segment due largely to the significant quantity of m atvs ordered by the dod for delivery in fiscal the company expects minimal fmtv sales volume in fiscal as deliveries of significant quantities of vehicles under this contract are not scheduled until early in fiscal  assuming a successful resolution of the protests 
the company is incurring costs on the fmtv program during the protest phase so that it is ready to move forward quickly if  as the company expects  the gao denies the protests 
the company does not expect to sustain the margins it experienced in its defense segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal as the company does not expect the reoccurrence of a lifo inventory benefit 
in addition  the company expects an adverse sales mix and increased investment in future business opportunities to more than offset the absorption benefits of increased volume 
sales in the company s access equipment segment remain soft  and the company does not expect a significant change in this market until fiscal the company expects that margins on jlg s traditional access equipment business will improve in fiscal due to the expectation that charges for increased bad debt reserves and restructuring costs  along with the impact from higher material costs in inventory  will not be as significant in the segment as they were in fiscal the access equipment segment will also benefit in fiscal from m atv production volume 
the company expects lower sales in its fire emergency segment in fiscal as a result of ongoing municipal spending weakness due to the impact of the recession on tax receipts 
however  this segment is traditionally the company s least cyclical  and the company believes that the percentage decrease in its sales for fiscal compared to fiscal will be significantly less than the company experienced in the access equipment and commercial segments in fiscal the company believes that its concrete placement products businesses will remain soft in fiscal until a modest pickup that the company expects to begin in the middle of calendar the company estimates that refuse collection vehicle sales will be flat to up modestly in fiscal 
table of contents due to the timing of deliveries for certain large national waste haulers in fiscal results of operations consolidated net sales three years ended september  the following table presents net sales see definition of net sales contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements by business segment in millions fiscal year ended september  net sales defense access equipment fire emergency commercial intersegment eliminations consolidated the following table presents net sales by geographic region based on product shipment destination in millions fiscal year ended september  net sales united states other north america europe  africa and the middle east rest of the world consolidated fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales decreased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in sales was a result of unprecedented reductions in the company s access equipment segment sales and continued reductions in the company s commercial segment sales as a result of the global recession and credit crisis 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales in the company s defense and domestic fire apparatus businesses 
defense segment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to higher sales of heavy payload tactical vehicles and parts service sales to fulfill the continuing requirements of the company s largest customer  the dod 
sales of new and remanufactured heavy payload tactical vehicles to the us army were up significantly in fiscal compared to the prior year 
defense segment sales in fiscal also benefited from the sale and installation of reducible height armor kits for mtvr trucks for the us marine corps and the sale of tak independent suspension systems to third party mrap original equipment manufacturers 
access equipment net sales decreased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal sales reflected substantially lower demand globally arising from recessionary economies and tight credit markets 
european  african and middle east and north american new machine sales each declined approximately in fiscal  while the rest of world equipment sales were down about 
access equipment sales in fiscal included million of intercompany sales to the defense segment related to the m atv program 

table of contents fire emergency segment net sales decreased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal increased shipments of domestic fire apparatus as well as a favorable sales mix in the segment s airport products business offset in part lower sales in other businesses in this segment 
lower sales in fiscal were driven by weak demand for towing recovery equipment as a result of the global recession and the inability of end customers to obtain adequate financing  a shift in component production from the fire emergency segment to the commercial segment  and a decrease in international fire apparatus shipments as a result of production delays 
commercial segment net sales declined to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in sales was largely the result of a decline in sales of concrete placement products due to continued weakness in us residential and nonresidential construction activity  and a decrease in refuse collection vehicle sales 
the decline in refuse collection vehicle sales was primarily the result of lower international sales as well as the timing of deliveries to large fleet customers 
this was offset in part by a shift in component production from the fire emergency segment to the commercial segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the inclusion of jlg in the results for the entire fiscal year in as compared to only ten months in fiscal  strong access equipment sales in europe  significantly higher defense sales and favorable foreign currency exchange rates drove the increase in consolidated net sales 
defense segment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in sales of new and remanufactured trucks  as well as higher parts service sales 
sales of new and remanufactured trucks were up versus the prior year as an increase in sales of new and remanufactured heavy payload trucks was partially offset by a decrease in medium payload truck sales and international truck sales 
parts service sales increased nearly in fiscal on significantly higher armor kit shipments and service work 
access equipment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was driven by the inclusion of jlg sales for the entire year compared to the company s ownership for ten months in the prior year period and significantly stronger demand for aerial work platforms outside north america 
favorable foreign currency exchange rates also increased sales by million 
these increases were offset in part by lower demand in north america in fiscal compared to the prior year as a result of slowing non residential construction markets 
access equipment sales in the prior year represented sales of jlg from december   the date of acquisition  through the end of the fiscal year 
fire emergency segment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sales reflected higher domestic fire apparatus sales as a result of continued market share gains and higher airport product sales  due partially to higher international sales  offset in part by weaker demand for towing equipment as well as mobile medical trailers and broadcast vehicles 
the towing equipment vehicle market was negatively impacted by lower demand as a result of rising fuel prices and uncertainty in the us economy 
a reduction in medical reimbursement rates by the us government to providers of mobile medical imaging services had a negative effect on sales of mobile medical trailers  and during the first half of fiscal  a writers strike reducing television networks advertising revenues negatively impacted the broadcast vehicle market 
commercial segment net sales decreased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was largely the result of lower domestic concrete placement product sales in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a slowdown in us residential construction and low volume subsequent to the pre buy ahead of the january diesel engine emissions standards changes

sharply lower sales volume in the access equipment and commercial segments also contributed to the decrease in operating results in fiscal in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  goodwill  the company reviews goodwill annually for impairment  or more frequently if potential interim indicators exist that could result in impairment 
at february   given the sustained decline in the price of the company s common stock subsequent to the company s fiscal year end when its share price approximated book value  depressed order rates during the second quarter which historically has been a strong period for orders in advance of the north american construction season  as well as further deterioration in credit markets and the macro economic environment  the company determined that the appropriate triggers had been reached to perform additional impairment testing on goodwill and its long lived intangible assets 
accordingly  the company conducted an assessment of the fair values of the company s reporting units 
the results of that assessment indicated that impairment charges to the values of goodwill and other long lived assets were required in the company s access equipment  fire emergency and commercial segments 
defense segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in operating income as a percent of sales compared to fiscal reflected better absorption of fixed costs  lower material costs  improved performance on service work and favorable lifo inventory adjustments of million as compared with a charge of million in fiscal the access equipment segment incurred an operating loss of  million  including million in pre tax  non cash impairment charges for goodwill and other long lived assets  in fiscal compared to operating income of million in fiscal in addition to the non cash impairment charges  the decline in operating income was due to the impact of sharply lower sales volume  sale of units comprised of higher cost materials purchased in fiscal when steel costs were high  and an increase in the provision for credit losses 
the impact of these factors was reduced by lower operating expenses as a result of aggressive cost reduction efforts 
the fire emergency segment incurred an operating loss of million  including million in pre tax  non cash impairment charges for goodwill and other long lived assets  in fiscal compared to operating income of million in fiscal the impairment charges more than offset otherwise favorable operating results for the segment due to a favorable product mix and improved performance at the company s domestic fire apparatus and airport product businesses as well as lower operating expenses throughout the segment as a result of cost reduction initiatives 
the commercial segment incurred an operating loss in fiscal of million  including million in pre tax  non cash impairment charges for goodwill and other long lived assets  compared to operating income of million in fiscal the decrease in operating results was the result of the non cash impairment charges and the impact of sharply lower concrete placement products sales volume  offset in part by reductions in operating expenses due to cost reduction efforts and a lifo inventory benefit of million due to significant reductions in inventory levels

fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in operating income in fiscal was principally due to the inclusion of jlg for the entire fiscal year and favorable results in the defense segment as a result of higher sales  offset in part by a decrease in operating income in the commercial segment due to a drop in concrete placement product sales  lower operating performance for certain operating units within the fire emergency segment as a result of lower sales and higher corporate costs 
defense segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales during fiscal reflected a higher mix of lower margin truck sales  lower negotiated margins on the fhtv contract and inefficiencies on the start up of a contract  offset in part by the reduction of a warranty reserve upon the expiration of a systemic warranty 
access equipment segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal operating income margins in the prior year were negatively affected by the timing of the jlg acquisition just prior to jlg s seasonal holiday shut down and charges of million related to the revaluation of inventory at the acquisition date of jlg 
in addition  operating income for fiscal benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates and a favorable product and customer mix 
fire emergency segment operating income decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in both operating income and operating income margin was the result of softness in the towing equipment market and adverse product mix as well as operating losses at osv  the company s domestic mobile medical trailer and broadcast vehicle business 
commercial segment operating income decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal operating income performance was negatively impacted by significantly lower domestic concrete mixer sales as a result of a slowdown in the us residential construction market combined with lower unit volumes subsequent to the pre buy ahead of the january diesel engine emissions standards changes 
corporate operating expenses and inter segment profit eliminations increased million to million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal the increase was largely due to higher personnel costs and additional information technology spending to support the company s growth objectives and the reduction of litigation expense reserves in the prior year period

table of contents analysis of discontinued operations three years ended september  on july   the company completed the sale of its ownership in geesink to a third party for nominal cash consideration 
geesink  a european refuse collection vehicle manufacturer  was previously included in the company s commercial segment 
due to the reclassification of million of cumulative translation adjustments out of shareholders equity  the company recorded a pre tax gain on the sale of geesink of million 
the historical results of operations of geesink have been reclassified in the company s consolidated statements of operations and are included in income loss from discontinued operations  for all periods presented 
fiscal compared to fiscal geesink sustained a pre tax loss of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal fiscal includes the nine month period ended july  the date of the sale 
during fiscal  geesink continued to incur high costs related to the rationalization of manufacturing facilities and inefficiencies associated with the relocation and start up of production of norba branded products in the netherlands 
in fiscal  the company recorded pre tax  non cash charges for the impairment of intangible assets of million which were largely non deductible for local tax purposes 
geesink recorded a tax benefit for operating losses of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal a valuation allowance was recorded against a majority of the non impairment losses incurred by geesink as the company determined that it was unlikely that the foreign tax benefits would be realized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made a check the box election to treat its foreign subsidiary  the european holding company parent of geesink  as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result of the election  the company recorded a million worthless stock and bad debt income tax benefit  of which million related to geesink and has been recorded in discontinued operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales at the company s european refuse collection vehicle business were million in fiscal  up as compared to the prior year  due largely to stronger demand in the netherlands and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
geesink sustained a pre tax loss of million in fiscal compared with a pre tax loss of million in fiscal the increase in the operating loss was primarily due to non cash charges for the impairment of intangible assets of million  costs associated with the rationalization of manufacturing facilities  inefficiencies associated with the relocation and start up of production of norba branded products from sweden to the netherlands and increased material and warranty costs 
in june  it became evident that synergies related to geesink s facility rationalization program would be lower than expected and costs to execute the rationalization would be higher than anticipated 
the resulting slower than expected and more difficult return to profitability of geesink s business  further escalation of raw material costs and a reduction in fabrication volume for the company s access equipment segment at geesink s romania facility due to a slowdown in the european access equipment market led to the company s conclusion that the charges for impairment were required 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  the company determined that geesink goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets were impaired and the company recorded non cash impairment charges of million in the third quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources financial condition at september  the company s capitalization was as follows in millions september  cash and cash equivalents total debt shareholders equity total capitalization debt plus equity debt to total capitalization 
table of contents debt decreased million during fiscal as the company utilized cash flows from operations and the proceeds from a public equity offering in august to pay down outstanding debt 
the decrease in shareholders equity was primarily the result of billion of pre tax  non cash charges for the impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  offset in part by the proceeds from the company s public equity offering in august the company entered into a performance based payments agreement on the m atv program during the fourth quarter of fiscal this resulted in a significant cash payment to the company near the end of the fiscal year which contributed to cash on hand of million at september  in october  the company prepaid million of debt all remaining outstanding term loan a debt and utilized much of its cash as of september  to pay m atv suppliers 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  the company had million of unused available capacity under the revolving credit facility as defined in liquidity as of september  borrowings under the revolving credit facility could  as discussed below  be limited by the financial covenants contained within the credit agreement 
cash flows operating cash flows the company generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million for fiscal while the company incurred a loss from continuing operations in fiscal compared to income in fiscal  the loss resulted from non cash impairment charges 
the higher generation of cash from operating activities in fiscal was the result of a substantial reduction in working capital  particularly related to trade accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and customer advances 
the changes in receivables  inventories and accounts payable were primarily driven by the decrease in sales during fiscal versus fiscal a significant increase in customer advances in fiscal was due to the timing of performance based payments from the us government on the fhtv contract awarded in october and  more significantly  the m atv contract awarded in june in september  after receipt of a m atv performance based payment  the company prepaid a supplier million for inventory deliveries scheduled to occur beginning in early fiscal the pre payment is recorded with in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
cash generated used from changes in significant working capital accounts were as follows in millions fiscal year ended september  receivables  net inventories  net accounts payable customer advances the company s cash flow from operations has fluctuated  and will likely continue to fluctuate significantly  from quarter to quarter  due to the start up or conclusion of large defense contracts and the timing of receipt of individually large performance based payments from the dod  as well as changes in working capital requirements arising principally from seasonal fluctuations in sales 
consolidated days sales outstanding decreased to days at september  from days at september  as a result of a higher proportion of consolidated sales concentrated in segments with shorter payment terms  offset in part by a day deterioration in days sales outstanding in the access equipment segment  which was driven in part by the granting of longer payment terms on new sales for competitive reasons 
consolidated inventory turns decreased from times at september  to times at september  largely as a result of access equipment segment sales declining at a faster pace than inventory

senior secured credit agreement in december  the company entered into a syndicated senior secured credit agreement credit agreement with various financial institutions  which consisted of a five year million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility and two term loan facilities term loan a and term loan b  and collectively  the term loan facility 
in march  the company entered into a second amendment the amendment to the credit agreement to provide relief under its leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement financial covenant 
the company believed that the amendment was required to avoid a potential financial covenant violation at the end of its second quarter of fiscal as a result of lower demand for certain of the company s products due to continued weakening in the global economy and tight credit 
the amendment also included an increase in the margin on libor loans to basis points  compared with basis points immediately prior to the amendment  and a requirement that the company prepay million and million of debt related to term loan a and term loan b  respectively 
the amendment also involved other changes to the credit agreement  including placing limitations on capital expenditures  dividends  investments and acquisitions  an increase in the frequency of mandatory prepayments  adding a senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  and requiring the grant of mortgage liens on certain real estate owned by the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the amendment also added a usage fee equal to an annualized rate of basis points on the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding loans under the credit agreement for any day on which the company has a corporate family rating from moody s investors service of b with negative watch or lower or a corporate credit rating from standard poor s rating services of b with negative watch or lower 
the company s credit ratings are reviewed regularly by these major debt 
table of contents rating agencies 
in january  standard poor s rating services lowered the company s long term debt rating from bb to b and credit watch negative citing weaker than expected operating results and the company s need to seek an amendment of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement 
likewise  in january  moody s investors service lowered the company s long term debt rating from ba to b with ratings under review for possible downgrade pending resolution of the negotiations with its bank  citing expectations of further erosion in the company s credit metrics due to the deterioration in several of the company s businesses  particularly the access equipment segment 
in march  following the amendment  both standard poor s rating services and moody s investors service lowered the company s long term debt ratings to negative outlook 
in august  following the company s common stock offering and award of the m atv contract  standard poor s rating services upgraded the company s long term debt rating to b with a stable outlook citing improved covenant headroom and good near term prospects for the company s defense segment 
the company accounted for the amendment in accordance with asc topic  debt modifications and extinguishments 
as the terms of the credit agreement both prior to and after the amendment allowed for the prepayment of the amounts due without a penalty  the company determined that the debt was callable on the date of the amendment 
as such  the present value of the cash flows both prior to and after the amendment was not determined to be substantially different 
accordingly  fees of million paid by the company to the parties to the credit agreement were capitalized in connection with the amendment  along with the existing unamortized debt fees  and will be amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the credit agreement using the interest method 
furthermore  in accordance with asc topic  costs incurred with third parties of million were expensed as incurred 
term loan a required principal payments of million  plus interest  due quarterly from december through september  with a final principal payment of million due december  as a result of excess available cash  through september   the company prepaid all of the quarterly principal payments related to term loan a as well as million of the final principal payment under term loan a 
the remaining outstanding balance under term loan a of million at september  was prepaid in full in october the outstanding balance under term loan b at september  of  million is due december  interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan facility are variable and are equal to the base rate which is equal to the higher of a bank s reference rate and the federal funds rate plus  a bank s prime rate or the sum of plus the off shore rate that would be applicable for an interest period of one month beginning on such day or the off shore or libor rate which is a bank s inter bank offered rate for us dollars in off shore markets plus a specified margin 
the margins on the revolving credit facility and term loan a are subject to adjustment  up or down  based on whether certain financial criteria are met 
at september   the interest rate spread on the revolving credit facility and term loan facility was basis points 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding at september  was and for term loans a and b  respectively 
to manage a portion of the company s exposure to changes in libor based interest rates on its variable rate debt  the company entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement on january  that effectively fixes the interest payments on a portion of the company s variable rate debt 
the swap  which has a termination date of december   effectively fixes the libor based interest rate on the debt in the amount of the notional amount of the swap at plus the applicable spread based on the terms of the credit agreement  as amended at september  
the notional amount of the swap at september  was billion and reduces to million on december  and million on december  neither the company nor the counterparty is required to collateralize its obligations under these swaps 
the company is exposed to loss if the counterparty defaults 
however  as of the date of this filing  the counterparty is a large aa rated global financial institution and the company believes that the risk of default is remote 
covenant compliance the credit agreement  as amended  contains various restrictions and covenants  including restrictions on the ability of the company and certain of its subsidiaries to  among other things  consolidate or merge  create liens  incur additional indebtedness and dispose of assets 
the credit agreement  as amended  also requires the company to maintain the following financial ratios leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness outstanding at quarter end to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters  as such terms are defined in the credit agreement  as amended

the senior secured leverage ratio is not permitted to be greater than the following fiscal quarters ending june  to september  through june  to september  through june  to september  to the senior secured leverage ratio limitation is not applicable until june  the credit agreement  as amended  limits the amount of dividends  stock repurchases and other types of distributions during any fiscal year in excess of certain limits based upon the leverage ratio as of the end of the fiscal quarter preceding the proposed distribution 
when the leverage ratio as of the end of a fiscal quarter is greater than to  then no such distribution may be made if  after giving effect to such distribution  the aggregate amount of all such payments made in such fiscal quarter would exceed the sum of per outstanding share of the company s common stock plus  or the aggregate amount of all such payments made in the applicable fiscal year would exceed million 
the company suspended payment of dividends effective april based on the company s current outlook for fiscal  the company expects to be able to meet the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement over the next twelve months

the purchase obligations amount included above represents the value of commitments considered firm  plus the value of all outstanding subcontracts 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for the remaining uncertain tax liabilities

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on equipment and parts sales when contract terms are met  collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
appropriate provisions are made for discounts  returns and sales allowances 
sales are recorded net of amounts invoiced for taxes imposed on the customer such as excise or value added taxes 
sales to the us government of non commercial products manufactured to the government s specifications are recognized using the units of delivery measure under the percentage of completion accounting method as units are accepted by the government 
the company includes amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the company charges anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress to earnings when identified 
the company accounts for certain equipment lease contracts as sales type leases 
the present value of all payments  net of executory costs such as legal fees  is recorded as revenue  the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales  certain profit is deferred in accordance with lease accounting rules and interest income is recognized over the terms of the leases using the effective interest method 
the company enters into rental purchase guarantee agreements with some of its customers 
these agreements are normally for a term of no greater than twelve months and provide for rental payments with a guaranteed purchase at the end of the agreement 
at the inception of the agreement  the company records the full amount due under the agreement as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales 
sales incentives the terms for sales transactions with some of the company s distributors and customers may include specific volume based incentives  which are calculated and paid or credited on account as a percentage of actual sales 
the company accounts for these incentives as sales discounts at the time of revenue recognition  which are recorded as a direct reduction of sales 
the company reviews its accrual for sales incentives on a quarterly basis and any adjustments are reflected in current earnings 
impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company performs its annual review at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or  under certain circumstances  a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business 
when estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill  an impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
impairment losses  limited to the carrying value of goodwill  represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 

table of contents the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  the impact of the economic environment  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions 
see critical accounting estimates 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others the company enters into agreements with finance companies whereby the company will guarantee the indebtedness of third party end users to whom the finance company lends to purchase the company s equipment 
in some instances  the company retains an obligation to the finance companies in the event the customer defaults on the financing 
in accordance with asc topic  guarantees  the company recognizes the greater of the fair value of the guarantee or the contingent liability required by asc topic  contingencies 
reserves are initially established related to these guarantees at the fair value of the guarantee based upon the company s understanding of the current financial position of the underlying customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the company becomes aware of deterioration in the financial condition of the customer borrower or of any impairment of the customer borrower s ability to make payments  additional allowances are considered 
although the company may be liable for the entire amount of a customer borrower s financial obligation under guarantees  its losses would generally be mitigated by the value of any underlying collateral including financed equipment  the finance company s inability to provide clear title of foreclosed equipment to the company  loss pools established in accordance with the agreements and other conditions 
during periods of economic downturn  the value of the underlying collateral supporting these guarantees can decline sharply to further increase losses in the event of a customer borrower s default 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management of the company has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s trade receivables are recorded 
the company evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additional reserves are established based upon the company s perception of the quality of the current receivables  including the length of time the receivables are past due  past experience of collectability and underlying economic conditions 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
goodwill in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the estimate of fair value of intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
the estimate of fair value of the reporting units is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by the market approach 
in estimating the fair value  management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows  future revenues  future earnings and other factors 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the rate used to discount estimated cash flows is a rate corresponding to the company s cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate  and is dependent upon interest rates at a point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner to cause further impairment of goodwill  which could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 

table of contents at february   given the sustained decline in the price of the company s common stock subsequent to the company s fiscal year end when its share price approximated book value  depressed order rates during the second fiscal quarter which historically has been a strong period for orders in advance of the north american construction season  as well as further deterioration in credit markets and the macro economic environment  the company determined that the appropriate triggers had been reached to perform additional impairment testing on goodwill and its indefinite lived intangible assets 
to derive the fair value of its reporting units  the company performed extensive valuation analyses with the assistance of a third party valuation advisor  utilizing both income and market approaches 
under the income approach  the company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
estimated future cash flows were based on the company s internal projection models  industry projections and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units was reconciled to the company s market capitalization as of february  plus an estimated control premium 
for the second quarter of fiscal impairment analysis  the company used a weighted average cost of capital of and a terminal growth rate of 
this resulted in a control premium of  based upon the relatively low price of the company s common stock on february  of per share 
under the market approach  the company derived the fair value of its reporting units based on revenue multiples of comparable publicly traded companies 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
as a result of this analysis   million of goodwill and million of other long lived intangible assets  including tradenames  technology and customer relationships  were written off during the second quarter of fiscal an increase in the discount rate of basis points would have resulted in an additional impairment charge of approximately million 
these charges were driven by current projections and valuation assumptions that reflected the company s belief that the current recession would be deeper and longer than previously expected  that credit markets would remain tight and that costs of capital had risen significantly since the company last performed its annual impairment testing 
throughout the third quarter of fiscal  access equipment order rates remained very weak and did not reflect a normal seasonal uptick 
further  during the quarter it became apparent to the company that federal stimulus actions would not contribute to access equipment orders in the near term  that credit availability to the company s access equipment customers would continue to be constrained  that us residential and nonresidential spending could remain at very low levels for an extended period beyond the company s previous estimates and that the global economic recovery would occur at a slower pace than previously expected 
these factors all contributed to the company s belief that this business would experience lower orders in fiscal and beyond than previously estimated 
as a result  the company initiated actions to further reduce its costs in its access equipment segment  including reductions in workforce and plant closings 
the company considered these factors together to be an indicator of potential impairment of goodwill in the access equipment reporting unit which comprises the entire access equipment segment 
the company therefore performed a detailed step analysis of the access equipment segment utilizing a discounted cash flow model that employed a discount rate and a terminal growth rate of 
as a result of the company s receipt of a contract award and related large delivery order for m atvs from the dod on june  and the company s decision to subcontract component manufacture and assembly of many m atvs to jlg  this model included expected cash flows related to this subcontract 
the resulting estimated fair value of jlg calculated in the impairment analysis was in excess of net book value of jlg 
based on this analysis  the company concluded that no additional impairment charge was required in the third quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment review relative to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets principally tradenames utilizing a discounted cash flow model that employed a discount rate and a terminal growth rate of 
this resulted in a control premium of  based on the price of the company s common stock on july  of per share 
as a result of this testing  the company recorded impairment charges of million and million for goodwill and tradenames  respectively  within the fire emergency segment 
in addition  based on this analysis  the company concluded that impairment charges were not required for any other reporting units 
assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are highly judgmental  especially given the severity and global scale of the current recession 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could have produced significantly different results 
for example  a discount rate of approximately would have likely resulted in further impairment charges at jlg  osv and imt 

table of contents approximately of the company s recorded goodwill and purchased intangibles are concentrated in the access equipment segment 
the access equipment segment consists of only one reporting unit  jlg 
the estimated fair value of jlg calculated in the fourth quarter of fiscal impairment analysis exceeded jlg s net book value by approximately 
the impairment model assumes that the us economy and construction spending and hence access equipment demand will show marked improvement beginning in fiscal assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are highly judgmental  especially given the severity and global scale of the current recession 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could have produced significantly different results 
a discount rate of approximately would have resulted in the fair value of the access equipment segment being million lower than its net book value 
for each basis point increase in the discount rate above  the fair value of the access equipment segment would decrease by approximately million 
furthermore  if the company had used cash flows which were lower than used in its impairment testing of goodwill  the fair value of the access equipment segment would be approximately million lower than its net book value at september  events and conditions that could result in the impairment of intangibles at jlg include a further decline in economic conditions  a slower or weaker economic recovery than currently estimated by the company or other factors leading to reductions in expected long term sales or profitability at jlg 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others the reserve for guarantees of the indebtedness of others requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s guarantees are granted 
the company evaluates the reserve based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded in accordance with asc topic  contingencies 
in most cases  the financing company is required to provide clear title to the equipment under the financing program 
the company considers the residual value of the equipment to reduce the amount of exposure 
residual values are estimated based upon recent auctions  used equipment sales and periodic studies performed by a third party 
additional reserves  based upon historical loss percentages  are established at the time of sale of the equipment based upon the requirement of asc topic  guarantees 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
product liability due to the nature of the company s products  the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
a substantial portion of these claims and lawsuits involve the company s access equipment  concrete placement and refuse collection vehicle businesses  while such lawsuits in the company s defense and fire emergency businesses have historically been limited 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to reduce or eliminate risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retentions that vary by business segment and by year 
as of september   the company was generally self insured for future claims up to million per claim 
the company establishes product liability reserves for its self insured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and the company s ability to reasonably estimate such loss 
there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation 
the company makes estimates based on available information and the company s best judgment after consultation with appropriate experts 
the company periodically revises estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances 
the company also utilizes actuarial methodologies to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of the adverse development of claims over time 
warranty sales of the company s products generally carry typical explicit manufacturers warranties based on terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
the company records provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at the time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
at times  warranty issues arise that are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company provides for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that from time to time additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company s products generally carry explicit warranties that extend from six months to five years  based on terms that are generally accepted in the marketplace 
selected components included in the company s end products such as engines  transmissions  tires  etc 
may include manufacturers warranties 
these manufacturers warranties are generally 
table of contents passed on to the end customer of the company s products and the customer would generally deal directly with the component manufacturer 
the company s policy is to record a liability for the expected cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty plans 
the company believes that the warranty accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the warranty provision can materially affect net income  the estimate requires management to forecast estimated product usage levels by customers  in the case of new models  components or technology may be different  resulting in higher levels of warranty claims experience than with existing  mature products  and certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
the estimate for warranty obligations is a critical accounting estimate for each of the company s operating segments 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts  labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns 
over the past three fiscal years  the company s warranty cost as a percentage of sales has ranged from of sales to of sales 
warranty costs tend to be higher shortly after new product introductions  especially those introductions involving new technologies  when field warranty campaigns may be necessary to correct or retrofit certain items 
accordingly  the company must make assumptions about the number and cost of anticipated field warranty campaigns 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the extent of pre production testing  the number of units involved and the extent of new features components included in new product models 
each quarter  the company reviews actual warranty claims experience to determine if there are any systemic defects that would require a field campaign 
also  based upon historical experience  warranty provision rates on new product introductions are established at higher than standard rates to reflect increased expected warranty costs associated with any new product introduction 
at times  warranty issues can arise which are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
if the estimate of warranty costs in fiscal increased or decreased by basis points  the company s accrued warranty costs  costs of sales and operating income would each change by million or  and  respectively 
benefit plans the pension benefit obligation and related pension income are calculated in accordance with asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at september  used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the company s annual pension expense by million 
the company s other postretirement benefits obligation and related expenses are calculated in accordance asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including health care trend rates 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the annual service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and decrease the annual service and interest cost by million 
the company s benefit plan assumptions are determined by using a benchmark approach as well as currently available actuarial data 
income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets 
the company records a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount management expects to realize 
management considers  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
the company will require future taxable income in the netherlands in order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset in that jurisdiction 

table of contents on october   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
asc topic  income taxes 
asc topic prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with asc topic is a two step process 
the first step is recognition  where the company evaluates whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than likelihood of being sustained  zero tax benefit is recorded 
for tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step  the company performs the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded 
the actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from the company s estimates 
in future periods  changes in facts and circumstances and new information may require the company to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions 
changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in results of operations and financial position in the period in which such changes occur 
as of september   the company had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling million 
new accounting standards refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards on the company s consolidated financial statements 
customers and backlog sales to the us government comprised approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales for this period 
a substantial majority of the company s net sales are derived from customer orders prior to commencing production 
the company s backlog as of september  increased to  million compared to  million at september  defense segment backlog increased to  million at september  compared to  million at september  due largely to the award of the m atv contract in june  the renewal of the fhtv contract in october  including a supplemental fhtv award in august  and the award of the fmtv contract in august the million delivery order under the recently awarded fmtv contract is under a government issued stop work order until resolution of protests filed with the gao by the company s competitors under that competition 
access equipment segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  due to the global recession and related impact on credit markets 
access equipment backlog as of september  included million relating to telehandler orders from the dod 
backlog figures reported for prior periods did not include amounts relating to telehandler orders from the dod 
the amount of these dod orders on hand  but not included in backlog  as of september  was million 
fire emergency segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  due in part to weakening domestic municipal markets  the fulfillment of domestic fire apparatus orders in fiscal received in advance of price increases and new national fire protection association standards that became effective january  fire emergency segment backlog at september  included million related to bai 
bai was sold in october commercial segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  backlog at september  included million of backlog for geesink 
geesink was sold in july unit backlog for domestic refuse collection vehicles was down compared to september  partly due to the timing of orders from several large waste haulers 
unit backlogs for front discharge and rear discharge concrete mixers were down and  respectively  compared to september  as a result of continued weak construction markets in the u 
s as a result of the global recession and related impact on credit markets 
reported backlog excludes purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed 
additionally  backlog excludes unfunded portions of the fhtv  mtvr  id iq  lvsr and fmtv contracts 
backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales or the ratio of the company s future sales to the dod versus its sales to other customers 
approximately of the company s september  backlog is not expected to be filled in fiscal 
table of contents financial market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market interest rates 
the company  as needed  uses interest rate swaps to modify its exposure to interest rate movements 
in january  the company entered into an interest rate swap to reduce the risk of interest rate changes associated with the company s variable rate debt issued to finance the acquisition of jlg 
the swap effectively fixes the variable portion of the interest rate on debt in the amount of the notional amount of the swap at plus the applicable spread based on the terms of the credit agreement 
the notional amount of the swap at september  was billion and reduces to million on december  and million on december  the swap terminates on december  the portion of the company s interest expense not effectively fixed in the interest rate swap remains sensitive to changes in the interest rates in the us and off shore markets 
in this regard  changes in us and off shore interest rates affect interest payable on the company s borrowings under its credit agreement 
a basis point increase or decrease in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt  including outstanding swaps  would have resulted in a change in fiscal pre tax interest expense of approximately million 
these amounts are determined on an annual basis by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on average borrowings during fiscal  after consideration of the interest rate swap 
the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations dollars in millions expected maturity date fair thereafter total value liabilities long term debt variable rate us average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps variable to fixed us average pay rate average receive rate for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 

table of contents commodity price risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel  aluminum and composites 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  rubber and others which are integrated into the company s end products 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company generally obtains firm quotations from its suppliers for a significant portion of its orders under firm  fixed price contracts in its defense segment 
in the company s access equipment  fire emergency and commercial segments  the company generally attempts to obtain firm pricing from most of its suppliers  consistent with backlog requirements and or forecasted annual sales 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 
foreign currency risk the company s operations consist of manufacturing in the us  belgium  canada  france  australia and romania and sales and limited vehicle body mounting activities on six continents 
international sales were approximately of overall net sales in fiscal  including approximately that involved export sales from the us the majority of export sales in fiscal were denominated in us dollars 
as a result of the manufacture and sale of the company s products in foreign markets  the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies in which certain of the company s transactions in foreign markets are denominated 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro and the uk pound sterling  changes between the us dollar and the australian dollar and changes between the us dollar and the brazilian real
