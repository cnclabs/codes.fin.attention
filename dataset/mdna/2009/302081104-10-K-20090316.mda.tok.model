table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business we have a limited number of clients and provide services to few industries 
in  approximately of our total revenues came from two clients 
we have derived and believe that we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from a limited number of large clients 
in  our two largest clients  centrica and norwich union  accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we generated of our total revenues in from centrica and of our total revenues in from norwich union 
we provide services to centrica under an agreement that expires in january and that can be terminated by centrica only for cause 
we provide services to norwich union under a framework agreement and work orders generated thereby 
the framework agreement expires in february and can be terminated by our client without cause upon six months prior notice and payment of a break up fee 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients in the near future 
the loss or financial difficulties of any of our large clients would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the impact of the ongoing global economic downturn could negatively affect our business in multiple ways 
the ongoing global economic downturn has disproportionately impacted companies in the banking  financial services and insurance industries  including a number of our clients 
a substantial portion of our clients are concentrated in the insurance  banking and financial services sector 
in  of our total revenues were derived from clients in those industries  including of our total revenues that were derived from clients in the insurance industry 
our business largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients and potential clients in these industries 
for example  on july   indymac bank  fsb  or indymac bank  one of our clients  was closed by the us treasury department s office of thrift supervision and the fdic was named conservator 
the fdic established indymac federal bank  fsb  or indymac federal  as the successor to indymac bank 
indymac federal subsequently announced that it would cease mortgage loan origination 
as a result  we ceased providing loan origination services to indymac federal and provided a reduced volume of services to indymac federal with regard to its existing mortgage loans 
continued adverse developments in these industries could further unfavorably affect our business 
other developments  such as consolidation  particularly involving our clients  could also cause the demand for our services in these industries to decline 
in addition  the decrease in the general level of economic activity  such as decreases in business and consumer spending  could result in a decrease in demand for our services  thus reducing our revenue 
the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
continued turbulence in global markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our clients 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to access financing or increase our cost of financing to meet liquidity needs  and affect the ability of our customers to use credit to purchase our services or to make timely payments to us  resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
if macroeconomic conditions worsen  we may not be able to predict the impact such worsening conditions will have on our targeted industries in general  and our results of operations specifically 
our industry may not develop in ways that we currently anticipate due to negative public reaction in the united states and elsewhere to offshore outsourcing  recently proposed legislation or otherwise 
we have based our strategy of future growth on certain assumptions regarding our industry and future developments in the market for outsourcing services 
for example  we believe that there will continue to be changes in product and service requirements  and investments in the products offered by our clients will continue to increase 
however  the trend to outsource business processes may not continue and could reverse 
offshore 
table of contents outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the united states and elsewhere  and many organizations and public figures have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in the united states and elsewhere 
in addition  there has been recent publicity about the negative experience of certain companies that use offshore outsourcing  particularly in india 
current or prospective clients may elect to perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring these services to offshore providers to avoid any negative perception that may be associated with using an offshore provider 
any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends would harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that operate out of facilities located in the united states and elsewhere 
a variety of us federal and state legislation has been proposed that  if enacted  could restrict or discourage us companies from outsourcing their services to companies outside the united states 
for example  legislation has been proposed that would require offshore providers to identify where they are located 
because most of our clients are located in the united states  any expansion of existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore outsourcing could adversely impact our ability to do business with us clients and have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  it is possible that legislation could be adopted that would restrict us private sector companies that have federal or state government contracts or financing from outsourcing their services to offshore service providers 
such restrictions could affect our ability to attract or retain clients that have such contracts in the future 
in other countries  such as the united kingdom which comprised of our total revenues in  there has also been some negative publicity and concern expressed regarding the possible effect of job losses caused by outsourcing 
legislation introduced in the united kingdom consolidating past case law in provides that if a company transfers or outsources its business or a part of its business to a transferee or a service provider  the employees who were employed in such business are entitled to become employed by the transferee or service provider on the same terms and conditions as they had been employed before the transfer 
the dismissal of such employees as a result of such transfer of business is deemed unfair dismissal and entitles the employees to compensation 
as a result  we may become liable for redundancy payments to the employees of our clients in the united kingdom who outsource business to us 
we are generally indemnified in our existing contracts with clients in the united kingdom to the extent we incur losses or additional costs due to the application of this legislation to us  and we intend to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients 
however  if we are unable to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients  we may be liable under any agreements we enter into in the future with united kingdom clients 
our client contracts contain certain termination provisions that could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we provide services to centrica under an agreement that has an initial term that expires in january and that can be terminated by centrica only for cause 
we generated of our total revenues in from centrica 
we provide services to norwich union under a framework agreement and work orders generated thereby 
we generated of our total revenues in from norwich union 
the framework agreement expires in february and can be terminated by our client without cause upon six months prior notice and payment of a break up fee 
contracts with bpo clients representing approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  will expire prior to december   excluding any client contracts with automatic renewal clauses 
the termination of a substantial percentage of these contracts with or without cause could have a material adverse impact on the predictability of our expected revenue stream 
many of our client contracts may be terminated by our clients without cause and do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business 
any failure to meet a client s expectations could result in a cancellation or non renewal of a contract or a decrease in business provided to us 
we may not be able to replace any client that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us  which would reduce our revenues 

table of contents we may fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations  as competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and we experience significant employee turnover rates 
the bpo industry is very labor intensive and our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract  hire  train and retain qualified employees  including our ability to attract employees with needed skills in the geographic areas in which we operate 
the industry  including us  experiences high employee turnover 
in  our turnover rate for billable employees was approximately 
there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients 
increased competition for these professionals  in the bpo industry or otherwise  could have an adverse effect on us 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees  particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to provide bpo services  would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins  and could lead to a decline in demand for our services 
high turnover rates generally do not impact our revenues as we factor the attrition rate into our pricing models by maintaining additional employees for each process 
however  high turnover rates do increase our cost of revenues and therefore impact our profit margins due to higher recruitment  training and retention costs as a result of maintaining larger hiring  training and human resources departments and higher operating costs due to having to reallocate certain business processes among our operations centers where we have access to the skilled workforce needed for the business 
in  we incurred approximately million on recruitment and approximately million on training costs due to employee turnover  thereby increasing our costs and reducing our profit margins for that period by million 
in addition  our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend  in large part  on our ability to attract  train and retain personnel with skills that keep pace with the demand for outsourcing  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
a lack of sufficiently qualified personnel could also inhibit our ability to establish operations in new markets and our efforts to expand geographically 
our failure to attract  train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have a long selling cycle for our bpo services that requires significant funds and management resources and a long implementation cycle that requires significant resource commitments 
we have a long selling cycle for our bpo services  which requires significant investment of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
our clients then evaluate our services before deciding whether to use them 
therefore  our selling cycle  which generally ranges from six to months  is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control  including our clients decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other providers or in house offshore resources and the timing of our clients budget cycles and approval processes 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully conclude a contract after the selling cycle is complete 
implementing our services involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us 
our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations  thereby delaying further the implementation process 
our clients and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services  and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to which we have devoted significant time and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
once we are engaged by a client  it may take us several months before we start to recognize significant revenues 
when we are engaged by a client after the selling process for our bpo services  it takes from four to six weeks to integrate the client s systems with ours  and up to three months thereafter to build up our services to the 
table of contents client s requirements 
depending on the complexity of the processes being implemented  these time periods may be significantly longer 
implementing processes can be subject to potential delays similar to certain of those affecting the selling cycle 
therefore  we do not recognize significant revenues until after we have completed the implementation phase 
we enter into long term contracts with our bpo clients  and our failure to estimate the resources and time required for our contracts may negatively affect our profitability 
the initial terms of our bpo client contracts typically range from three to seven years 
in many of our bpo contracts we commit to long term pricing with our clients and therefore bear the risk of cost overruns  completion delays  wage inflation and adverse movements in exchange rates in connection with these contracts 
if we fail to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a contract  future wage inflation rates or currency exchange rates or fail to accurately hedge our currency exchange rate exposure or if we fail to complete our contractual obligations within the contracted timeframe  our revenues and profitability may be negatively affected 
consistency in our revenues from period to period depends in part on our ability to reflect the changing demands and needs of our existing and potential bpo clients 
if we are unable to adjust our pricing terms or the mix of products and services we provide to meet the changing demands of our bpo clients and potential bpo clients  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
most of our bpo contracts use a pricing model that provides for hourly or annual billing rates 
industry pricing models are evolving  however  and we anticipate that clients may increasingly request transaction based pricing 
this pricing model will place additional pressure on the efficiency of our service delivery so that we can maintain reasonable operating margins 
if we are unable to adapt our operations to evolving pricing protocols  our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to offer pricing that is attractive relative to our competitors 
in addition  the bpo services we provide to our clients particularly under our general framework agreements  and the revenues and income from those services  may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts changes over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
furthermore  our clients  some of which have experienced rapid changes in their prospects  substantial price competition and pressures on their profitability  have in the past and may in the future demand price reductions  automate some or all of their processes or change their outsourcing strategy by moving more work in house or to other providers  any of which could reduce our profitability 
any significant reduction in or the elimination of the use of the services we provide to any of our clients  or any requirement to lower our prices  would harm our business 
our transformation services are cyclical and based on specific projects involving short term contracts 
our transformation services  such as our decision analytics services and our risk and financial management services  are cyclical and can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles 
changes in the deadlines or the scope of work required for compliance with the requirements of legislation applicable to our clients could have a significant impact on certain service offerings of our risk and financial management services business 
in addition  our decision analytics services and our risk and financial management services usually consist of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
the short term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses 

table of contents our operating results may experience significant variability and as a result it may be difficult for us to make accurate financial forecasts 
our operating results may vary significantly from period to period 
although our existing agreements with original terms of three or more years provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business  the long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions 
the timing of revenue recognition under new client agreements also varies depending on when we complete the implementation phase 
the completion of implementation varies significantly based upon the complexity of the processes being implemented 
our period to period results have in the past and may also in the future fluctuate due to other factors  including client losses  delays or failure by our clients to provide anticipated business  variations in employee utilization rates resulting from changes in our clients operations  delays or difficulties in expanding our operations centers and infrastructure including hiring new employees or constructing new operations centers  changes to our pricing structure or that of our competitors  currency fluctuation  seasonal changes in the operations of our clients and other events identified in this annual report on form k 
our revenues are also affected by changes in pricing under our contracts at the time of renewal or by pricing under new contracts 
for example  because the majority of our revenues are denominated in pounds sterling or us dollars while most of our expenses are incurred and paid in indian rupees  our revenues can decrease or increase significantly if the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the pound sterling and the us dollar fluctuate significantly 
in addition  some of our contracts do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business 
these factors may make it difficult to make accurate financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenues that we do not receive as a result of delays in implementing our services or client losses 
if our actual results do not meet any estimated results that we announce  or if we underperform market expectations as a result of such factors  trading prices for our common stock could be adversely affected 
our senior management team is critical to our continued success and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team could harm our business 
our future success substantially depends on the continued services and performance of the members of our management team and other key employees possessing technical and business capabilities  including industry expertise  that are difficult to replace 
specifically  the loss of the services of our executive chairman  vikram talwar  or of our president and chief executive officer  rohit kapoor  could seriously impair our ability to continue to manage and expand our business 
there is intense competition for experienced senior management and personnel with technical and industry expertise in the industry in which we operate  and we may not be able to retain these officers or key employees 
although we have entered into employment and non competition agreements with all of our executive officers  certain terms of those agreements may not be enforceable and in any event these agreements do not ensure the continued service of these executive officers 
messrs 
talwar and kapoor and certain of their affiliates have certain registration rights with respect to their shares of common stock 
in addition  we currently do not maintain key person insurance covering any member of our management team 
the loss of any of our key employees  particularly to competitors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our inability to effectively manage our rapid infrastructure and personnel growth could have a material adverse effect on our operations  results of operations and financial condition 
since we were founded in april  we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our operations 
we have ten operations centers in india and the philippines  including a workstation center in pasay city  philippines  that became operational in april our headcount has increased from approximately  on december  to approximately  including personnel managed under structured client service agreements on december  we expect to develop and improve our internal systems in the 
table of contents locations where we operate in order to address the anticipated growth of our business 
we are also looking at additional locations other than india and the philippines to invest in an operations center 
we believe expanding our geographic base of operations will provide higher value to our clients by decreasing the risks of operating from a single country including potential shortages of skilled employees  increases in wage costs during strong economic times and currency fluctuations  while also giving our clients access to a wider talent pool and establishing a base in countries that may be competitive in the future 
however  we may not be able to effectively manage our infrastructure and employee expansion  open additional operations centers or hire additional skilled employees as and when they are required to meet the ongoing needs of our clients  and we may not be able to develop and improve our internal systems 
our inability to execute our growth strategy  to ensure the continued adequacy of our current systems or to manage our expansion effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin 
our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our operations staff and other employees 
for example  wage costs in india have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the united states and europe for comparably skilled professionals  which has been one of our competitive advantages 
however  because of rapid economic growth in india  increased demand for bpo services from india and increased competition for skilled employees in india  wages for comparably skilled employees in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states and europe  which may reduce this competitive advantage 
we may need to increase the levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the quality and number of employees that our business requires 
wages are generally higher for employees performing decision analytics services and risk and financial management services than for employees performing bpo services 
as the scale of our decision analytics services and our risk and financial management services increases  wages as a percentage of revenues will likely increase 
wage increases in the long term may reduce our profit margins 
additionally  because substantially all of our employees are based in india and paid in indian rupees  while our revenues are primarily in us dollars and pounds sterling  our employee costs as a percentage of revenues may increase or decrease significantly if the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the pound sterling and the us dollar fluctuate significantly 
we face significant competition from us based and us based outsourcing and information technology companies and from our clients  who may perform outsourcing services themselves  either in house  in the united states or through offshore groups or other arrangements 
the market for outsourcing services is highly competitive  and we expect competition to intensify and increase from a number of sources 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are price  service quality  sales and marketing skills  the ability to develop customized services and technological and industry expertise 
we face significant competition for our services from our clients own in house groups  including  in some cases  in house groups operating offshore 
in addition  our total revenues in could be affected by the decision of a limited number of our other clients to move work from third party contractors to in house groups operating offshore or to decrease work from third party contractors as a result of internal strategic restructurings 
we also face competition from non us based outsourcing and it companies including those in the united kingdom and india and us based outsourcing and it companies 
in addition  the trend toward offshore outsourcing  international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuing technological changes will result in new and different competitors entering our markets 
these competitors may include entrants from the communications  software and data networking industries or entrants in geographic locations with lower costs than those in which we operate 
some of these existing and future competitors have greater financial  personnel and other resources  a broader range of service offerings  greater technological expertise  more recognizable 
table of contents brand names and more established relationships in industries that we currently serve or may serve in the future 
in addition  some of our competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with larger  more established companies in order to increase their ability to address client needs  or enter into similar arrangements with potential clients 
the trend in multi vendor relationships has been growing  which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other vendors 
increased competition  our inability to compete successfully against competitors  pricing pressures or loss of market share could result in reduced operating margins  which could harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we may disrupt our clients operations as a result of inadequate service or other factors  including telecommunications or technology downtime or interruptions 
the services we provide are often critical to our clients businesses  and any failure to provide those services could result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of whether we are responsible for that failure 
in particular  our dependence on our offshore operations centers requires us to maintain active voice and data communications among our operations centers in india and the philippines  our international technology hubs in the united states and our clients offices 
although we maintain redundant facilities and communications links  disruptions could result from  among other things  technical breakdowns  computer glitches and viruses and weather conditions 
we also depend on certain significant vendors for facility storage and related maintenance of our main technology equipment and data at those technology hubs 
any failure by these vendors to perform those services  any temporary or permanent loss of our equipment or systems  or any disruptions to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications could impede our ability to provide services to our clients  have a negative impact on our reputation  cause us to lose clients  reduce our revenues and harm our business 
we may not be fully insured for all losses we may incur 
although we attempt to limit and mitigate our liability for damages arising from negligent acts  errors or omissions through contractual provisions  limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
in addition  certain liabilities  such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients  are generally not limited under those agreements 
although we have general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions  property damage or loss and breaches of privacy and network security  that coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or to be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage  or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data  whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and cause us to lose clients 
we are typically required to collect and store sensitive data in connection with our services  including names  addresses  social security numbers  credit card account numbers  checking and savings account numbers and payment history records  such as account closures and returned checks 
in addition  many of our agreements with our clients do not include any limitation on our liability to them with respect to breaches of our obligation to keep the information we receive from them confidential 
we take precautions to protect confidential client and customer data 
however  if any person  including any of our employees  penetrates our network security or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates sensitive data  we could be subject to significant liability and lawsuits from our clients or their own customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws 
penetration of the network security of our data centers could have a negative impact on our reputation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents oak hill capital partners and its affiliates  vikram talwar and rohit kapoor exercise significant influence over us  and their interests in our business may be different than yours 
a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock are currently beneficially owned by oak hill capital partners lp and certain of its affiliates  our executive chairman  vikram talwar  and our president and chief executive officer  rohit kapoor 
as of december   oak hill capital partners lp and certain of its affiliates beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock  mr 
talwar and certain trusts for his benefit and that of his family collectively beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock  and mr 
kapoor and certain trusts for his benefit and that of his family collectively beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  each of these parties can exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs and all matters requiring a stockholders vote  including the composition of our board of directors  the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets 
this concentration of ownership also may delay  defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 
the interests of these stockholders may conflict with your interests 
we may not succeed in identifying suitable acquisition candidates or integrating an acquired business into our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
one of our strategies is to broaden our geographic presence  gain new clients  enter new streams of services and expand capacity both organically and through strategic acquisitions 
we may not  however  succeed in identifying suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices  have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions or be able to consummate any acquisition 
our management may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or maintain our standards  controls and policies  and any acquisition we do complete may not result in long term benefits to us 
acquisitions involve a number of risks  including diversion of management s attention  ability to finance the acquisition on attractive terms  failure to retain key personnel  legal liabilities and the need to amortize acquired intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
future acquisitions may also result in the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity securities 
we may choose to expand operations to additional countries and may not be successful in maintaining our current profit margins in our new locations due to factors beyond our control 
we are currently evaluating additional locations other than india and the philippines in which to invest in an operations center 
we cannot predict the extent of government support  availability of qualified workers  or monetary and economic conditions in other countries 
although some of these factors will influence our decision to establish operations in another country  there are inherent risks beyond our control  including exposure to currency fluctuations  political uncertainties  foreign exchange restrictions and foreign regulatory restrictions 
one or more of these factors or other factors relating to expanded international operations could result in increased operating expenses and make it more difficult for us to manage our costs and operations  which could harm our business and negatively impact our operating results 
we may increase the range of services that we provide to our clients and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate 
we are exploring opportunities to provide outsourced services that we have not provided to date 
should we decide to expand our service offerings  our results of operations may be negatively affected during any transition or growth period before such offerings achieve profitability 
for example  we may need to expand our training of our existing employees or recruit new  specially trained employees to provide these services  which could 
table of contents increase our costs of revenues disproportionately to the revenues generated by such services 
other challenges we may face include attracting and retaining clients for such services  integrating any new services into our current suite of services and managing any resulting growth in our operations 
failure to adhere to the regulations that govern our business could have an adverse impact on our operations 
our clients are often subject to regulations that may require that we comply with certain rules and regulations in performing services for them that would not otherwise apply to us 
debt collection services  for example  may be subject to the fair debt collection practices act  which regulates debt collection practices 
in addition  many us states require a debt collector to apply for  be granted and maintain a license to engage in debt collection activities in a state 
we are currently licensed or exempt from licensing requirements to provide from india debt collection services in the united states in all but two us states that have non exempt requirements and have separate conditional exemptions with respect to our ongoing collection obligations 
other federal laws and regulations that apply to certain portions of our business include the fair credit reporting act  the gramm leach bliley act  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  the truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act and the fdic rules and regulations 
if we do not maintain our licenses or other qualifications to provide our services  we may not be able to provide services to existing customers or be able to attract new clients and could lose revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil fines and criminal penalties 
risks related to the international nature of our business our financial condition could be negatively affected if foreign governments reduce or withdraw tax benefits and other incentives currently provided to companies within our industry  or if the same are not available for other reasons 
under the indian finance act   we currently benefit from a holiday from indian corporate income taxes 
as a result  our service operations have been subject to relatively lower tax liabilities 
we incurred minimal income tax expense in as a result of the tax holiday  compared to approximately million that we would have incurred if the tax holiday had not been available for that period without accounting for double taxation treaty set offs 
our current tax holiday expires in when our tax holiday expires or terminates  our tax expense will materially increase 
in may  the government of india adopted the indian finance act   that imposed a minimum alternative tax  or mat  on indian companies that benefit from a tax holiday with effect from april  any mat paid by us can be carried forward for a maximum period of eight years and can be used as a credit against corporate income taxes payable by us after expiration of the tax holiday  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
in addition  in may  the government of india implemented a fringe benefit tax on the exercise or vesting of equity instruments on or after april  the fringe benefit tax is payable by the employer on the exercise of options at the rate of on the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price of such options on the date of vesting of such options 
the fringe benefit tax is also payable on the vesting of full value awards such as restricted stock at the rate of on the fair market value of such awards 
the legislation permits the employer to recover the fringe benefit tax from the employees and we seek to recover the fringe benefit tax from those of our employees on whose behalf such tax is payable by us 
if we are unsuccessful in recovering the fringe benefit tax from our employees  we may experience a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
we currently benefit from a four year income tax holiday in the philippines that is extendable for an additional two years 
our current income tax holidays are expected to expire in the middle of  unless extended 
while we fully intend to apply for extensions of these holidays  it is possible that such extensions could be denied  or that due to changes in the government of the philippines that these holidays could be removed entirely 
should either of these events occur  our philippine tax liability could increase 

table of contents we may be required to pay additional taxes in connection with audits by the indian taxing authorities 
us and indian transfer pricing regulations require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be at an arm s length price 
transactions among the company s subsidiaries and the company may be required to satisfy such requirements 
accordingly  the company determines the pricing among its associated enterprises on the basis of detailed functional and economic analysis involving benchmarking against transactions among entities that are not under common control 
if the applicable income tax authorities review any of the company s tax returns and determine that the transfer price applied was not appropriate  the company may incur increased tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties 
the company is currently involved in disputes with the indian tax authorities over the application of some of its transfer pricing policies 
the company has received six assessment orders from the indian tax authorities with respect to their audit of certain of the company s subsidiaries 
the indian tax authorities are examining income tax returns for other tax years 
the details of the assessment orders as of december  are as below entity tax year issue amount demanded amount deposited exl india the assessment order alleges that the transfer price we applied to transactions between exl india and exl inc in the tax year was not appropriate and disallows certain expenses claimed as tax deductible by exl india 
million million exl india the assessment order alleges that the transfer price we applied to transactions between exl india and exl inc for the tax year was not appropriate and disallows certain expenses claimed as tax deductible by exl india

million million based on advice from our indian tax advisors  the facts underlying our position and our experience with these types of assessments  we continue to believe that the probability of loss is remote and have not accrued any amount with respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements

we cannot assure you that our appeals will be successful or that these appeals will be finally resolved in the near future 
we have deposited the entire amount demanded by the indian tax authorities with respect to the assessment orders received by exl india for the and tax years and partial amounts with respect to the assessment orders received by exl inc subsequent to december   we have reached agreement with the indian tax authorities for a deposit of approximately million with respect to the assessment order received by exl india for the tax year  of which we have deposited million to date and expect to deposit the remainder in the near future 
there is a likelihood that we might receive similar orders for other years until the above disputes are resolved 
future claims may be based on the transfer pricing or permanent establishment claims alleged by the indian tax authorities  or may be based on alternative arguments

table of contents currency fluctuations among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  philippine peso and the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
although a substantial portion of our revenues are denominated in uk pounds sterling in or us dollars in  most of our expenses in are incurred and paid in indian rupees 
we report our financial results in us dollars 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  the philippine peso and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future

any failure by our hedging counterparties to meet their contractual obligations thereunder could materially and adversely effect our profitability 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence involving india  the philippines  the united states or other countries could adversely affect the financial markets  result in a loss of client confidence and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  including those involving india  the philippines  the united states or other countries  may adversely affect worldwide financial markets and could potentially lead to economic recession  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles 
these events also pose significant risks to our people and to our operations centers 
south asia has  from time to time  experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries  including india  pakistan and china 
in recent years there have been several instances of military confrontations along the indo pakistan border 
there continues to be potential for hostilities between india and pakistan due to recent terrorist activities  such as the terrorist attacks on the indian parliament and in mumbai  india  and the geopolitical climate along the border 
although this has not been the case to date  such political tensions could create a perception that there is a risk of disruption of services provided by india based companies  which could have a material adverse effect on the market for our services 
furthermore  if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities  particularly hostilities that were protracted or involved the threat or use of nuclear weapons  we might not be able to continue to operate 
our insurance policies may not insure us against losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war 
a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india  and we are subject to regulatory  economic and political uncertainties in india 
our principal operating subsidiaries are incorporated in india  and virtually all of our assets and our professionals are located in india 
we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india 
in the early s  india experienced significant inflation  low growth in gross domestic product and shortages of foreign currency reserves 
the indian government  however  has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy 
india s government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the 
table of contents economy  including the bpo industry 
certain of those programs  which have benefited us  include tax holidays  liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation 
we cannot assure you that liberalization policies will continue 
in addition  the government of india is considering introducing a reservation policy to the private sector in india  pursuant to which all private sector companies operating in india  including our subsidiaries  would be required to reserve a certain percentage of jobs for the economically underprivileged population in the states where such companies are incorporated 
if this policy is adopted  our ability to hire employees of our choice may be affected due to restrictions on our pool of potential employees and competition for these professionals 
furthermore  the rate of economic liberalization could change  and specific laws and policies affecting technology companies  foreign investment  currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investment in our securities could also change 
since  the government of india has changed six times 
the current indian government is a coalition of many parties  some of which are communist and other far left parties in india  some of which do not want to continue india s current economic policies 
various factors  including a collapse of the present coalition government due to the withdrawal of support of coalition members  could trigger significant changes in india s economic liberalization and deregulation policies  disrupt business and economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular 
our financial performance and the trading price of our shares may be adversely affected by changes in inflation  exchange rates and controls  interest rates  government of india policies including taxation policies  social stability or other political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future 
the philippines periodically experiences political or economic instability  which could disrupt our operations  increase our costs and harm our business 
the philippines continues to experience low growth in its gross domestic product  significant inflation and shortages of foreign exchange 
we are exposed to the risk of rental and other cost increases due to inflation in the philippines  which has historically been at a much higher rate than in the united states 
these conditions could create political or economic instability that could harm businesses operating in the philippines 
in addition  the philippines has and may continue to experience political instability  including strikes  demonstrations  protests  marches  coups d tat  guerilla activity or other types of civil disorder 
these instabilities and any adverse changes in the political environment in the philippines could increase our operational costs  increase our exposure to legal and business risks and make it more difficult for us to operate our business in the philippines 
restrictions on entry visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states  which could have a material adverse effect on future revenues 
the vast majority of our employees are indian nationals 
the ability of some of our executives and employees to work with and meet our us and european clients and our clients from other countries depends on their ability to obtain the necessary visas and entry permits 
in response to terrorist attacks and global unrest  us and european immigration authorities have increased the level of scrutiny in granting visas 
immigration laws in those countries may also require us to meet certain levels of compensation and comply with other legal requirements as a condition to obtaining or maintaining entry visas 
these restrictions have significantly lengthened the time requirements to obtain visas for our personnel  which has in the past resulted  and may continue to result  in delays in the ability of our personnel to meet with our clients 
in addition  immigration laws are subject to legislative change and varying standards of application and enforcement due to political forces  economic conditions or other events  including terrorist attacks 
we cannot predict the political or economic events that could affect immigration laws or any restrictive impact those events could have on obtaining or monitoring entry visas for our professionals 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary visas for personnel who need to get to our clients sites  or if such visas are delayed  we may not be able to provide services to our clients or to continue to provide these services on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents an outbreak of an infectious disease or any other serious public health concerns in asia or elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the outbreak of an infectious disease in asia or elsewhere or any other serious public health concerns could have a negative impact on the economies  financial markets and business activities in the countries in which our end markets are located  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome in asia and avian influenza  or bird flu  across asia and europe  including recent outbreaks in parts of india  have adversely affected a number of countries and companies 
although we have not been adversely impacted by these recent outbreaks  we can give no assurance that a future outbreak of an infectious disease among humans or animals or any other serious public health concerns will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are vulnerable to natural disasters that could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely affect our business  results of operation and financial condition 
india is susceptible to natural disasters  including typhoons  tsunamis  floods and earthquakes 
the philippines is additionally susceptible to volcanic eruptions 
substantially all of our operations centers and employees are located in india and the philippines 
if our operations centers are damaged by a typhoon  tsunami  flood  earthquake  volcanic eruption or other natural disaster  our operations and our ability to provide services to our clients could be interrupted or delayed significantly 
our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses 
in addition  although all of our operations centers have access to other power sources  disaster management facilities in india may not be adequate to protect against potential losses 
in addition  clients may terminate their contracts with us if we cannot resume providing services quickly enough 
as a result  a natural disaster in india or the philippines could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
if more stringent labor laws or other industry standards in india become applicable to us  our profitability may be adversely affected 
india has stringent labor legislation that protects the interests of workers  including legislation that sets forth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial obligations on employers upon retrenchment 
in addition  we are subject to certain industry standards regarding our employees  particularly with regard to overtime and transportation of employees 
our employees may also in the future form unions 
if these labor laws or industry standards become more stringent or are more strictly enforced  or if our employees unionize  it may become difficult for us to maintain flexible human resource policies  discharge employees or downsize  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
investors may have difficulty effecting service of process or enforcing judgments obtained in the united states against our subsidiaries in india or our executive officers 
our primary operating subsidiaries are organized in india and a number of our executive officers reside outside of the united states 
most of our assets are located in india 
as a result  you may be unable to effect service of process upon our affiliates who reside in india outside their jurisdiction of residence 
in addition  you may be unable to enforce against these persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence judgments obtained in courts of the united states  including judgments predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the united states 
sections a and section of the indian civil procedure code   or the civil code  govern recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments 
section a of the civil code provides for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment without having to file an original suit in india  provided such judgments have been rendered by courts in a country or territory outside india which the government of india has declared to be a reciprocating territory 
we have been advised by our indian counsel that the united states and india do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments other than certain 
table of contents arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not it is predicated upon the federal securities laws of the united states  would not be enforceable in india as such 
however  if the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in india based on a final judgment that has been obtained in the united states  section of the civil code provides that the foreign judgment will be conclusive as to certain matters 
the suit must be brought in india within three years of the date of the foreign judgment 
it is unlikely  however  that a court in india would award damages on the same basis as a court in the united states if an action is brought in india 
it is also unlikely that an indian court would enforce judgments obtained in the united states if it viewed the amount of damages awarded as excessive or inconsistent with indian practice

see forward looking statements 
overview we are a recognized provider of outsourcing and transformation services focused on providing a competitive edge to our clients by outsourcing and transforming their business processes 
our outsourcing services provide integrated front  middle and back office process outsourcing services for our us based and us based clients 
outsourcing services involve the transfer to us of select business operations of a client  such as claims processing  finance and accounting and customer service  after which we administer and manage the operations for our client on an ongoing basis 
we also offer a number of transformation service offerings that include decision analytics  risk and financial management and operations and process excellence services 
these transformation services help our clients improve their operating environments through cost reduction  enhanced efficiency and productivity initiatives  and improve the risk and control environments within our clients operations whether or not they are outsourced to us 
a significant portion of our business relates to processes that we believe are integral to our clients operations  and the close nature of our relationships with our clients assists us in developing strong strategic long term relationships with them 
we serve primarily the needs of global companies in the insurance  utilities  financial services and transportation sectors 
we market our services directly through our sales and marketing and strategic account management teams  which operate out of new york and london  and our business development team  which operates out of noida  india 
we currently operate nine operations centers in india and one operations center in the philippines 
we completed the inductis acquisition on july  the inductis acquisition has expanded the types and sophistication of the decision analytics services we offer 
the results of operations of inductis are consolidated in our financial statements with effect from july  as a result  our results of operations for the years ended december  and are not comparable to our results of operations for the year ended december  on october   we consummated an initial public offering of our shares of common stock 
our initial public offering resulted in net proceeds of million to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and related expenses 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol exls 
in connection with the initial public offering  we effected a conversion of our common stock and a two for one stock split 
on august   the company completed the sale of all of its shares of noida customer operations private limited ncop to aviva global services singapore pte ltd 
for all the periods presented  ncop is reported as a discontinued operation and any discussion throughout this management s discussion and analysis and consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 
revenues we generate revenues principally from contracts to provide outsourcing and transformation services 
in  we had total revenues of million compared to total revenues of million in  an increase of 
the key drivers of growth in our total revenues in were as follows expansion of our client base  ongoing growth in existing client relationships  and addition of new services in the transformation services business 

table of contents we anticipate that our revenues will grow as we expand our service offerings  both organically and through acquisitions 
revenues from new clients are an indicator of successful marketing efforts and do not represent a trend in our results of operations 
we provide our clients with a range of outsourcing services  including insurance services  banking and financial services  utilities  finance and accounting services and collection services 
our clients transfer the management and execution of their processes or business functions to us 
as part of this transfer  we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant outsourcing services  implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client s customers 
each client contract has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement 
the outsourcing services we provide to any of our clients particularly under our general framework agreements  and the revenues and income that we derive from those services  may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts change over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
for outsourcing services  we enter into long term agreements with our clients with initial terms ranging from three to five years 
although these agreements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business  the long selling cycle for our outsourcing services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions 
revenues under new client contracts also vary depending on when we complete the selling cycle and the implementation phase 
our transformation services include various services such as decision analytics services which are intended to facilitate more effective data based strategic and operating decisions by our clients  risk and financial management services  and operations and process excellence services 
our transformation services can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles 
in addition  our transformation services usually consist of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
the short term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses 
we serve clients mainly in the united states and the united kingdom  with these two regions generating approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  in both the united states and the united kingdom  there has been recent negative publicity and proposed legislation with regard to outsourcing 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our industry may not develop in ways that we currently anticipate due to negative public reaction in the united states and elsewhere to offshore outsourcing  recently proposed legislation or otherwise 
if these trends continue and result in the enactment of additional legislation for which we are unable to contractually protect ourselves  our revenues could be materially affected 
with the recent global economic downturn and resulting increases in unemployment in both of these countries  we expect these publicity and legislative trends to continue and possibly intensify 
our management actively monitors legislative activities in the united states and united kingdom  both directly and through industry organizations 
however  if legislation were enacted in the united kingdom or the united states that has the effect of severely curtailing our activities in such countries  it is unlikely that we would be able to quickly replace such lost revenues 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large clients 
in the years ended december  and  our total revenues from our two largest clients were million and million  respectively  accounting for and of our total revenues  respectively  during these periods 

table of contents we provide services to centrica  which represented million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and million  or of our total revenues for the year ended december   under an agreement that is scheduled to expire on january  we provide services to norwich union  which represented million  or  of our total revenues in the year ended december  and million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december   under a framework agreement and work orders generated by this agreement 
the framework agreement expires in february in july  we entered into a deed of settlement setting forth certain amendments that will be made to the framework agreement 
on july   norwich union exercised its pre existing option to purchase the shares of ncop by paying us an amount that approximates the net asset value of ncop 
the purchase closed on august  for the years ended december   and  ncop is reported as a discontinued operation 
contracts with bpo clients representing approximately excluding any client contracts with automatic renewal clauses of our total revenues for the year ended december  will expire prior to december   while the remainder of our outsourcing services contracts expire in more than one year or do not have specified initial terms and remain in effect until terminated or until there are no active work orders or engagement schedules under such contracts 
we derived revenues from twenty three and thirty eight new clients for our services in the years ended december  and  respectively 
although we are increasing and diversifying our customer base  we expect in the near future that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients 
we recognize revenues from services provided under our client contracts on a cost plus  time and materials  fixed price  contingent fee or unit price basis 
revenue is recognized on cost plus contracts on the basis of contractually agreed direct and indirect costs incurred on a client contract plus an agreed upon profit mark up 
revenue is recognized on time and material contracts primarily on the basis of full time equivalent employees  including direct and indirect costs  incurred on a client contract 
revenue is recognized on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
revenue on contingent fee based contracts is recognized when the related contingency has been met to the client s satisfaction 
revenue is recognized on unit price based contracts based on the number of specified units of work such as the number of e mail responses delivered to a client 
revenues also include amounts representing reimbursable expenses that are billed to and reimbursed by our clients and typically include telecommunication and travel related costs 
the amount of reimbursable expenses that we incur  and any resulting revenues  can vary significantly from period to period depending on each client s situation and on the type of services provided 
for the years ended december  and december   and  respectively  of our revenues represent reimbursement of such expenses 
to the extent our client contracts do not contain provisions to the contrary  we bear the risk of inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to our contracts 
we hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupee us dollar and rupee us pound rupee us dollar foreign currency exposure 
our management has observed in recent periods a shift in industry pricing models toward transaction based pricing 
we believe this trend will continue and we have begun to use transaction based pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a billing rate model to a transaction based model 
transaction based pricing requires that we maintain peak efficiency in our service delivery in order to maintain our operating margins 
in addition  we have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi vendor relationships with regard to their outsourcing needs 
although we have recently had certain clients consolidate their operations within a single service provider  this was done after a period in which the client maintained 
table of contents relationships with multiple vendors and we believe the trend toward multi vendor relationships will continue 
a multi vendor relationship allows a client to obtain optimal pricing and other contract terms from each vendor  which can result in significantly reduced operating margins from the provision of services to such client 
to the extent our large clients expand their use of multi vendor relationships  our operating margins may be reduced with regard to such clients 
expenses cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of employee costs  which include salary  retention and other compensation expenses  recruitment and training costs  non cash amortization of stock compensation expense  and traveling and lodging costs  and costs relating to our facilities and communications network  which include telecommunication and it costs  facilities and customer management support  operational expenses for our outsourcing centers  and rent expenses 
the most significant components of our cost of revenues is employee compensation  recruitment  training and retention 
salary levels in india  employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues 
salary increases are generally awarded each year effective april accordingly  employee costs are generally lower in the first quarter of each year compared to the rest of the year 
we make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements 
although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated  a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees  which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees in india  particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute outsourcing services  would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins 
in addition  cost of revenues also includes a non cash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to our issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients 
we expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in india  the philippines and the united states to service additional business  in particular as our transformation services business grows and as wages continue to increase in india 
in particular  we expect training costs to continue to increase as we continue to add staff to service new clients 
there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients 
as our existing competitors continue to grow  and as new competitors enter the market  we expect competition for skilled professionals in each of these areas to continue to increase  with corresponding increases in our cost of revenues to reflect increased compensation levels for such professionals 
we also expect our cost of revenues to increase due to employee turnover resulting in higher recruitment and training costs 
cost of revenues is also affected by our long selling cycle and implementation period for our outsourcing services  which require significant commitments of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
in addition  once a client engages us in a new contract  our cost of revenues may represent a higher percentage of revenues until the implementation phase for that contract  generally three to four months  is completed 
we also expect cost of revenues to increase when we add new operations centers due to increases in telecommunication and rent expenses and other facilities operating costs 
in particular  we have established a 
table of contents new workstation operations center in pasay city  philippines  which became operational in april as we increase the amount of physical infrastructure available to perform our operations  we expect that utilization will decrease and this will have a negative impact on our operating margin 
the india finance act  has imposed additional taxes on leased real estate 
as a result  in the future we may decide to purchase real estate in india instead of leasing it  which is likely to increase our initial cash outflow in connection with any expansion of our operations centers in india 
sg a expenses our general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses relating to salaries of senior management and other support personnel  legal and other professional fees  telecommunications  utilities and other miscellaneous administrative costs 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries of sales and marketing and strategic account management personnel  client relationship management  travel and brand building 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest heavily in our front end sales and strategic account management functions to better serve our clients 
we also expect our costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our back end support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development  performance management and training programs 
sg a expenses also include non cash amortization of stock compensation expense related to our issuance of equity awards to senior management  members of our board of directors and advisory board  other support personnel and consultants 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization pertains to depreciation and amortization of our tangible assets  including network equipment  cabling  computers  office furniture and equipment  motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets acquired is part of depreciation and amortization 
as we add facilities  including our new workstation operations center in pasay city  philippines  which became operational in april  we expect that depreciation expense will increase  reflecting additional investments in equipment such as desktop computers  servers and other infrastructure 
foreign exchange exchange rates we report our financial results in us dollars and a substantial portion of our total revenues is earned in uk pounds sterling 
accordingly  our results of operations are adversely affected if the uk pound sterling depreciates against the uk dollar 
although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars or uk pounds sterling and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to and  respectively for the year ended december   most of our expenses in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  were incurred and paid in indian rupees 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling and the uk dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate in the future 
the results of our operations could be substantially impacted as the indian rupee appreciates or depreciates against the us dollar or the us pound sterling 
currency regulation according to the prevailing foreign exchange regulations in india  an exporter of outsourcing services that is registered with a software technology park or an export processing zone in india  such as our subsidiaries exl india and inductis india  is required to realize its export proceeds within a period of months from the date of exports 
similarly  in the event that such exporter has received any advance against exports in foreign exchange from its overseas customers  it will have to render the requisite services so that the advances so received are earned within a period of months 
if exl india or inductis india did not meet these conditions  it would be required to obtain permission to export foreign currency from the reserve bank of india 

table of contents exlservice holdings and inductis receive payments under most of our client contracts and are invoiced by exl india and inductis india  as applicable  in respect of services that exl india and inductis india  as applicable  provide to our clients under these contracts 
exl india and inductis india hold the foreign currency they receive  primarily from exlservice holdings and inductis  in an export earners foreign currency account 
all foreign exchange requirements  including import of capital goods  expenses incurred during foreign traveling of employees and discharge of foreign exchange can be met using the foreign currency in that account 
as and when funds are required in india  such funds are transferred to an ordinary indian rupee account 
income taxes the india finance act  provides exl india and inductis india with a ten year holiday from indian corporate income taxes as an entity exporting it services from designated software technology parks and export processing zones in india 
the india finance act  phases out the tax holiday over a ten year period from fiscal through fiscal accordingly  facilities established in india on or before march  have a ten year tax holiday  new facilities established on or before march  have a nine year tax holiday and so forth until march  the indian government has enacted legislation in fiscal year extending the tax holiday until march  exl india and inductis india provides services from its wholly owned  export oriented units situated in noida  gurgaon and pune 
the income derived from the services rendered from these facilities is not subject to taxes in india until april  as a result of the tax holiday  our outsourcing services operations have been subject to relatively lower tax liabilities 
for example  we recognized lower income tax expense with respect to our foreign operations for the year ended december  as a result of the tax holiday  compared to approximately million that we would have incurred if the tax holiday had not been available for that period without accounting for double taxation treaty set offs 
when our tax holiday expires or terminates  our tax expense will materially increase 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
we determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
in may  the government of india adopted the indian finance act   that imposed mat on indian companies that benefit from a tax holiday with effect from april  any mat paid by us can be used as a credit against corporate income taxes payable by us after expiry of the tax holiday for up to seven years  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset of million has been recognized as of december  exl philippines  our subsidiary that conducts our operations in the philippines  enjoys a four year income tax holiday extendable up to six years beginning april  the date of commencement of operations 
the income tax holiday is subject to validation by the philippines economic zone authority based on certain minimum investments 
if exl philippines does not attain the required investments it will not qualify for the income tax holiday and will be subject to a gross income tax 

table of contents us and indian transfer pricing regulations require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be at an arm s length price 
transactions among our subsidiaries and the company may be required to satisfy such requirements 
accordingly  we determine the pricing among our associated enterprises on the basis of detailed functional and economic analysis involving benchmarking against transactions among entities that are not under common control 
based on the analysis  we had made certain changes to our transfer pricing agreements with effect from april if the applicable income tax authorities review any of our tax returns and determine that the transfer price applied was not appropriate  we may incur increased tax liabilities  including accrued interest and penalties 
we are currently involved in disputes with indian tax authorities over the application of some of our transfer pricing policies 
we have received six assessment orders from the indian tax authorities with respect to their audit of certain of our subsidiaries 
the indian tax authorities are examining income tax returns for other tax years 
the details of the assessment orders as of december  are as below entity tax year issue amount demanded amount deposited exl india the assessment order alleges that the transfer price we applied to transactions between exl india and exl inc in the tax year was not appropriate and disallows certain expenses claimed as tax deductible by exl india

million million exl inc the assessment order alleges that exl inc has a permanent establishment in india 
million million exl inc the assessment order alleges that exl inc has a permanent establishment in india 
million million based on advice from our indian tax advisors  the facts underlying our position and our experience with these types of assessments  we believe that the probability of loss is remote and have accordingly not accrued any amount with respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect any impact from these assessments on our future income tax expense 
we are subject to us income taxes on the profits we recognize in the united states 
we have deposited the entire amount demanded by the indian tax authorities with respect to the assessment orders received by exl india for the and tax years and partial amounts with respect to the assessment orders received by exl inc subsequent to december   we have reached agreement with the indian tax authorities for a deposit of approximately million with respect to the assessment order received by exl india for the tax years  of which we have deposited million to date and expect to deposit the remainder in the near future 
there is a likelihood that we might receive similar orders for other years until the above disputes are resolved 
inductis acquisition on july   we completed the inductis acquisition 
inductis is a provider of research and analytics services 
the inductis acquisition has expanded the types and sophistication of the research and analytics services 
table of contents we offer 
we paid approximately million on the closing date in the form of million in cash including amounts paid for working capital adjustments  the issuance of  shares of our common stock after withholding in respect of taxes and million in transaction costs  and paid a million bonus in january we also assumed million of inductis debt  which we repaid in full on september  for the period ended december   inductis profit adjusted earnout revenue which amount is defined in the inductis acquisition agreement to equal either its revenue or a lower amount if certain profit margin targets are not achieved as set forth in the inductis acquisition agreement was equal to million dollars 
as a result  per the terms of the inductis acquisition agreement  we issued an additional  shares of our common stock worth approximately million to the former holders of inductis common stock in satisfaction of some of our earnout payment obligations under that agreement and  shares of restricted stock previously granted to the former holders of inductis common stock have been earned based on the achievement of certain performance based criteria and will vest over a three year period 
there are no further payments due to inductis based on inductis profit adjusted earnout revenue 
critical accounting policies we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements  as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies include revenue recognition  estimating tax liabilities  stock based compensation  derivative instruments and pension plan liabilities 
these accounting policies and the associated risks are set out below 
future events may not develop exactly as forecast  and estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from outsourcing and transformation services 
revenues from outsourcing services are recognized primarily on a time and material  cost plus or unit priced basis  revenues from transformation services are recognized primarily on a time and material  fixed price or contingent fee basis 
the services provided within our contracts generally contain one unit of accounting 
revenue is recognized under our contracts generally when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of amounts billed is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized on time and material contracts primarily on the basis of full time equivalent employees  including direct and indirect costs  incurred on a client contract 
revenue is recognized on cost plus contracts on the basis of contractually agreed direct and indirect costs incurred on a client contract plus an agreed upon profit mark up 
revenue is recognized on unit price based contracts based on the number of specified units of work such as the number of e mail responses delivered to a client 
such revenues are recognized as the related services are provided in accordance with the client contract 
when the terms of the client contract specify service level parameters that must be met such as turnaround time or accuracy  we monitor such service level parameters to determine if any service credits or penalties have been incurred 
revenue is recognized net of any service credits that are due to a client 
we have experienced minimal credits and penalties to date 
revenue is recognized on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
we estimate the proportional performance of a contract by comparing the actual number of hours or days worked to date to the estimated total number of hours or days required to complete each engagement 
the use of the proportional performance method requires significant judgment relative to estimating the number of hours or days required to complete the contracted scope of work  including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
we regularly monitor our estimates for completion of a project and record changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined 
if a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project  such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified 

table of contents revenue on contingent fee based contracts is recognized when the related contingency has been met to the client s satisfaction 
the company accrues for revenue and receivables for services rendered between the last billing date and the balance sheet date 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax estimates include decisions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on our evaluation of our tax position  we believe we have adequately accrued for probable exposures as of december  to the extent we are able to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
at december   we performed an analysis of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance on our indian subsidiaries and concluded that a valuation allowance offsetting certain deferred tax assets be recorded  on the basis that it is more likely than not that there will not be future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
we perform this assessment at the end of each reporting period 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  stock based compensation significant factors considered in determining the fair value of stock awards are as follows 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated in sab until december  effective january   the estimated expected term of options granted has been revised based on historical experience since october  which is representative of the expected term of the options 
effective january   the volatility has been calculated based on the volatility of our common stock and the volatility of stocks of comparative companies 
prior to this  volatility was calculated based on the volatility of stocks of comparative companies 
the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model is based on us treasury zero coupon bonds with a remaining term similar to the expected term of the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
derivative instruments in the normal course of business  we actively look to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under our policies  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the uk pound sterling and the indian rupee 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of mitigating the underlying exposure from foreign 
table of contents currency fluctuation risks associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with the changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and not for speculative trading purposes 
we also hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with foreign exchange contracts that are designated effective and qualify as cash flow hedges  under sfas no 
changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges which are deemed effective  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the contract is settled and at that time are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges deemed ineffective are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate hedge effectiveness at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis 
other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under sfas consist of forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
at december   forward exchange contracts of million and gbp million were outstanding 
we have evaluated the effectiveness of all our forward exchange contracts 
for the years ended december  and  net gains losses from ineffective cash flow hedges included in our consolidated statements of income totaled million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized net gains from other derivatives included in our consolidated statements of income totaled million and  respectively 
for hedge contracts discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period  any related derivative amounts recorded in accumulated comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings 
pension plan liability we provide our employees in india with benefits under a defined benefit plan  which we refer to as the gratuity plan 
the gratuity plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement or on termination of employment in an amount based on the respective employee s salary and years of employment with us 
we determine our liability under the gratuity plan by actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method 
under this method  we determine our liability based upon the discounted value of salary increases until the date of separation arising from retirement  death  resignation or other termination of services 
critical assumptions used in measuring the plan expense and projected liability under the projected unit credit method include the discount rate  expected return on assets and the expected increase in the compensation rates 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
we periodically evaluate and update other assumptions used in the projected unit credit method involving demographic factors  such as retirement age and turnover rate  to reflect our experience 
the future mortality rates used are consistent with those published by the life insurance corporation of india 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rate we use is equal to the yield on high quality fixed income investments in india at the measurement date 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and therefore increases gratuity expense 
since our gratuity plan is unfunded  we have not assumed any returns on assets

however  while management of working capital  including timing of collections and payments  affects operating results only indirectly  the impact on working capital and cash flows provided by operating activities can be significant 
the increase in cash flows provided by operations is predominantly due to the increase in net income adjusted for non cash items by million and changes in working capital by million 
changes in working capital is due to inflows from reduction in accounts receivable by million  deferred revenue by million and increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities by million  partially offset by outflows due to increase in prepaid and other current assets by million and payment of accounts payable million 
in general  our relationships with our outsourcing services clients  which services provide the majority of our revenues and cash flow from operations  are long term  with our agreements with such clients typically having initial terms of between three and five years 
as a result  our revenues and cash flows with regard to these clients are generally not subject to variability due to changes in pricing terms on a year to year basis 
however  to the extent the volume of services we provide to a client increases or decreases  out total revenues and cash flow from such client will correspondingly increase or decrease on a period to period basis 
a significant portion of our revenues and our cash flow from operating activities are dependent on several large clients  in particular centrica and norwich union 
to the extent there are changes in our pricing rates or 
table of contents models with respect to these clients in connection with our planned renewals of our agreements with each of these clients  our revenues and cash flow from operating activities will be correspondingly affected 
in particular  were we to lose one or both of these clients  our revenues and cash flows would be materially affected 
furthermore  as noted previously  trends towards multi vendor relationships and transaction based pricing models in our industry could impact our cash flows from current and potential large clients in future periods 
cash used in investing activities increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase is primarily the result of increased capital expenditures including million for our new operations center in the philippines  payment made towards purchase consideration of million for an acquisition  partially offset by the proceeds from sale of our discontinued operations of million 
cash flows from financing activities decreased from an inflow of million in the year ended december  to an outflow of million in the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options by million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and recognition of an excess tax benefit on exercise of stock options of million in the year ended december  we expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business 
as we have focused on expanding our cash flow from operating activities  we have made significant capital investments  primarily related to new facilities 
capital expenditures we make to meet client needs represent primarily leasehold improvements to build out facilities  telecommunications equipment  and computer hardware and software we purchase in connection with managing client operations 
we incurred approximately million of capital expenditures in we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million to million in primarily to meet the growth requirements of our clients  including expanding our facilities in india as well as to improve our internal technology 
the timing and volume of such capital expenditures in the future will be affected by new contracts we may enter into or the expansion of our existing contracts 
in addition  we expect to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time until november through december   we had repurchased an aggregate of approximately million of our previously announced program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
in addition  in connection with the tax assessment orders issued against exl india and exl inc we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to the assessment orders received by us and for similar orders for subsequent years that may be received by us 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from our october initial public offering for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities and remaining proceeds from our october initial public offering to finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the remaining net proceeds from our october initial public offering will be sufficient to meet our ongoing capital expenditure  working capital and other cash needs over the next two years 
if we have significant growth through acquisitions or require additional operating facilities to service customer contracts  we may need to obtain additional financing 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in millions less than year years years after years total capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other obligations a total contractual cash obligations a represents estimated payments under the company s gratuity plan 
our delivery centers in india have been established as export oriented units under the export import policy the policy or software technology parks of india units stpi under the stpi guidelines issued by the government of india that has provided us with certain incentives on imported and indigenous capital goods 
under this policy  these units must achieve certain export ratios and realize revenues attributable to exports over a specified period 
in the event that these units are unable to meet the requirements over the specified period  we may be required to refund these incentives along with penalties and fines 
however  management believes that these units will achieve the export levels within the required timeframe as they have consistently generated the required levels of export revenues 
exl philippines is registered as an ecozone it enterprise with the philippines economic zone authority 
exl philippines has an export obligation of million during the three year period ending march  the registration has also provided us with certain incentives on the import of capital goods 
management believes that exl philippines will achieve these export levels within the required timeframe

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the loss of future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributable to all market sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables 
our exposure to market risk is a function of our expenses and revenue generating activities in foreign currencies 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings and equity to loss 
most of our exposure to market risk arises out of our foreign currency accounts receivable 
pursuant to our investment policy  our surplus funds are kept as cash or cash equivalents and are invested in highly rated commercial paper and money market accounts to reduce our exposure to market risk with regard to these funds 
risk management procedures we manage market risk through our treasury operations 
our senior management and our board of directors approve our treasury operation s objectives and policies 
the activities of our treasury operations include management of cash resources  implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures  borrowing strategies  if any  and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies 
components of market risk exchange rate risk 
the functional currency of exlservice holdings  and our subsidiaries exl inc  inductis llc and inductis inc  is the us dollar 
the functional currency of exl india  inductis india and exl support services pvt 
ltd  which we refer to as esspl  is the indian rupee 
the functional currency of exl uk 
table of contents is the uk pound sterling 
the functional currency of inductis singapore pte limited is the singapore dollar 
the functional currency of exl philippines is the philippine peso 
in each case  the functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates 
monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated into functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing on the related balance sheet dates 
transactions in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction 
all transaction related foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the related balance sheet date 
resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the last business day of each month  which approximates the average monthly exchange rate 
our exposure to market risk arises principally from exchange rate risk 
although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars in the year ended december  or uk pounds sterling in the year ended december   most of our expenses in the year ended december  were incurred and paid in indian rupees 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  uk pound sterling and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues  expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency accounts receivable 
based upon our level of operations during the year ended december  and excluding any hedging arrangements that we had in place during that period  a appreciation depreciation in the uk pound sterling against the uk dollar would have increased decreased revenues in the year ended december  by approximately million 
similarly  a appreciation depreciation in the indian rupee against the us dollar would have increased decreased our expenses incurred and paid in indian rupees in the year ended december  by approximately million 
we have sought to reduce the effect of indian rupee and uk pound sterling gbp exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts to cover a substantial portion of cost incurred in our india operations 
forward exchange contracts with a notional amount of million and gbp million were outstanding at december  and of million and gbp million were outstanding at december  the forward foreign exchange contracts typically mature within twelve months  must be settled on the day of maturity and may be cancelled subject to the payment of any gains or losses in the difference between the contract exchange rate and the market exchange rate on the date of cancellation 
we use these instruments as cash flow hedges and not for speculative purposes 
we may not purchase contracts adequate to insulate ourselves from indian rupee and uk pound sterling foreign exchange currency risks 
in addition  any such contracts may not perform adequately as a hedging mechanism 
we may  in the future  adopt more active hedging policies  and have done so in the past 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling million at december  these amounts were invested principally in a short term investment portfolio primarily comprised of investment grade commercial paper  u 
s treasury bills  mutual funds and money market accounts 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets  working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the interest income from these funds will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates would reduce future investment income 
a decrease in short term rates would reduce our interest income for the year ended december  by approximately million
