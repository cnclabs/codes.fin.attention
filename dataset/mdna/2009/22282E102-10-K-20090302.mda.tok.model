item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview contract structures 

table of contents generally  we are protected against fluctuations in fuel price risk in our domestic energy from waste business because most of our waste is provided under long term contracts where we are paid for our fuel at fixed rates 
at thirteen of our energy from waste facilities  differing amounts of waste disposal capacity are not subject to long term contracts and  therefore  we are partially exposed to the risk of market fluctuations in the waste disposal fees we may charge for fuel 
at our domestic biomass projects  we pay for our fuel  and have exposure to fuel price risk because wood waste most often may be purchased only under short term arrangements 
at our international independent power projects  we do not have material fuel cost risk because generally fuel costs are contractually included in our electricity revenues  or fuel is provided by our customers 
in some of our international projects  the project entity which in some cases is not our subsidiary has entered into long term fuel purchase contracts that protect the project from changes in fuel prices  provided counterparties to such contracts perform their commitments 
in addition  we sell  recover and recycle materials  principally ferrous metals  under short term arrangements from most of our energy from waste projects  and have exposure to market fluctuations with respect to such sales 
during the second and third quarters of  we experienced historically high recycled metal prices  which declined materially during the fourth quarter of revenue from these materials is included within our waste services revenue 
we are protected against energy market fluctuations at most of our projects  which have long term contracts for the sale of energy output 
at a few of our projects  we enter into shorter term arrangements for energy sales  or have market based pricing and therefore  we have some exposure to energy market fluctuations 
in  approximately of our waste services revenue was subject to market based pricing  and approximately of our energy revenue was subject to market based pricing 
expiration of our contracts at energy from waste projects we own and at projects we operate will subject us to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing our revenues 
as the original waste disposal and operating contracts have approached the expiration dates of their initial term  we have renewed  extended or replaced these contracts on acceptable terms 
several more of these original waste disposal and operating contracts will expire at various dates through  and we have risk in obtaining acceptable arrangements and associated revenue  for such projects thereafter 
as our remaining agreements at facilities we own near expiration dates  we intend to seek replacement or additional contracts for waste supplies  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  we expect to be able to offer disposal services at rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste and provide acceptable revenues 
as we seek to enter into extended or new contracts following these expiration dates  we expect that medium and long term contracts for waste supply  for a substantial portion of facility capacity  will be available on acceptable terms in the marketplace 
we also expect that it may be relatively more difficult to enter into medium and long term contracts for sales of energy 
as a result  following the expiration of these initial long term contracts  we expect to have on a relative basis more exposure to market risk  and therefore revenue fluctuations  in energy markets than in waste markets 
by  we expect approximately of our domestic energy revenue to be sold at market rates unless contractual arrangements we put in place provide otherwise 
we also will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
interest rate risk outstanding loan balances under the credit facilities bear interest at floating rates  which are calculated as either interest at a reserve adjusted british bankers association interest settlement rate  commonly referred to as libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum  plus a borrowing margin 
for details as to the various election options under the credit facility  see note long term debt of the notes 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the term loan was million 
we have not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements against this balance 
a hypothetical increase of in the underlying december  market interest rates would result in a potential reduction to twelve month future earnings of million  pre tax 
we have project debt outstanding bearing interest at floating rates that could subject us to the risk of increased interest expense due to rising market interest rates  or an adverse change in fair value due to declining interest rates 
table of contents on fixed rate debt 
of our project debt  approximately million was floating rate debt at december  however  interest rate risk relating to the floating rate project debt is borne by the client communities because debt service is passed through to those clients under the contractual structure of their agreements 
we had only one interest rate swap relating to project debt outstanding as of december  in the notional amount of million related to floating rate project debt 
gains and losses  however  on this swap are for the account of the client community and are not borne by us 
contingent interest on january   we completed an underwritten public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due the debentures 
the debentures bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears  on february and august of each year  commencing on august  and will mature on february  beginning with the six month interest period commencing february   we will pay contingent interest on the debentures during any six month interest period in which the trading price of the debentures measured over a specified number of trading days is or more of the principal amount of the debentures 
when applicable  the contingent interest payable per  principal amount of debentures will equal of the average trading price of  principal amount of debentures during the five trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period 
the contingent interest feature in the debentures is an embedded derivative instrument 
the first contingent cash interest payment period does not commence until february   and as such  the fair market value for the embedded derivative was zero as of december  for additional information related to the credit facilities  see note long term debt of the notes and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources recapitalization 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have investments in energy projects in various foreign countries  including the philippines  china  india and bangladesh  and to a much lesser degree  united kingdom  ireland  italy and costa rica 
we do not enter into currency transactions to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
at some projects  we have mitigated our currency risks by structuring our project contracts so that our revenues are adjusted in line with corresponding changes in currency rates 
therefore  only working capital and project debt denominated in other than a project entity s functional currency are exposed to currency risks 
as of december   we had million of project debt related to two heavy fuel oil projects in india 
for million of the debt related to project entities whose functional currency is the indian rupee  exchange rate fluctuations were recorded as translation adjustments in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining million of debt was denominated in us dollars 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a adverse change in december  quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million  pre tax 
as of december   we also had net investments in foreign subsidiaries and projects

risk related to the investment portfolio with respect to our insurance business  the objectives in managing the investment portfolio held by our insurance subsidiary are to maintain necessary liquidity and maximize investment income and investment returns while minimizing overall market risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including duration of liabilities  underwriting results  overall tax position  regulatory requirements  and fluctuations in interest rates 
investment decisions are made by management  in consultation with an independent investment advisor  and approved by our insurance subsidiary s board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of securities 
the market risks related to the fixed maturity portfolio are primarily credit risk  interest rate risk  reinvestment risk and prepayment risk 
the market risk related to the equity portfolio is price risk 

table of contents fixed maturities with respect to our insurance business  interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in interest rate 
we view these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability matching 
we estimate the payout patterns of the liabilities  primarily loss reserves  of our insurance subsidiary to determine their duration 
duration targets are set for the fixed income portfolio after consideration of the duration of the liabilities that we believe mitigate the overall interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the relative short term nature of our insurance and other liabilities 
the effective duration of the portfolio was years as of december  and we believe that the portfolio duration is appropriate given the relative short tail nature of the auto programs and projected run off of all other lines of business 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would cause an approximate decrease in the fair value of the portfolio while a hypothetical basis point decrease would cause an approximate increase in fair value 
credit risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in the credit quality of such investment 
our exposure to credit risk is mitigated by our investment in high quality fixed income alternatives 
fixed maturities held by our insurance subsidiary include million and million of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  collectively mbs as of december  and  respectively 
all mbs held by our insurance subsidiary were issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  which are both rated aaa by moody s investors services 
one of the risks associated with mbs is the timing of principal payments on the mortgages underlying the securities 
we attempt to limit repayment risk by purchasing mbs whose cost is below or does not significantly exceed par  and by primarily purchasing structured securities with repayment protection which provides more certain cash flow to the investor such as mbs with sinking fund schedules known as planned amortization classes pac and targeted amortization classes tac 
the structures of pacs and tacs attempt to increase the certainty of the timing of prepayment and thereby minimize the prepayment and interest rate risk 
in  our insurance subsidiary recognized million in gains on sales of fixed maturities 
equity securities our insurance subsidiary s investments in equity securities are generally limited to fortune companies with strong balance sheets  along with a history of dividend growth and price appreciation 
as of december   equity securities represented of our insurance company s total investment portfolio 
during  the insurance subsidiary permanently impaired equity securities for a total of million 
the impaired equity securities were primarily in the financial services sector
