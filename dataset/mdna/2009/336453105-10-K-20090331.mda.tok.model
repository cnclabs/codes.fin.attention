item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates and judgments and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill impairment 
in september  we entered into an informal agreement informal agreement with our regulators  the federal reserve bank of kansas city and the new mexico financial institutions division the regulators 
under the terms of the informal agreement  the company and or the bank agreed  among other things  to formulate a written plan to maintain a sufficient capital position at the bank and at the company  including attaining a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of at the bank level  with no date specified for achieving those levels 
in addition  the company and the bank have agreed to maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  not to pay any dividends  not to distribute any interest  principal or other sums on trust preferred securities  not to issue or guarantee any debt or trust preferred securities  and not to purchase or redeem any shares of the company s stock 
this informal agreement can be terminated by a joint decision between the regulators if they conclude such action is warranted 
although management believes that the company and the bank are in substantial compliance with the terms of the informal agreement  there can be no assurance that the company and the bank will remain in compliance and that there will not be further action 
table of contents by the regulators 
at december   the company and the bank were considered adequately capitalized under regulatory guidelines  subjecting the company and the bank to prompt supervisory and regulatory actions pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  prohibiting us from accepting  renewing  or rolling over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic  which we are currently pursuing  and making us subject to restrictions on the interest rates that we could pay on brokered deposits 
under certain circumstances  a well capitalized or adequately capitalized institution may be treated as if the institution is in the next lower capital category 
depending on the level of capital  the regulators and or the fdic can institute other corrective measures to require additional capital and have broad enforcement powers to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violation of laws and regulations 
see supervision and regulation below 
on october   we completed the closure of our utah branches  which had achieved substantial loan growth but had essentially no deposit growth 
the utah branches were acquired as part of the fcib acquisition in october of at the closing date  the utah branches included million in total loans and million in deposits 
the utah loans will continue to be held and serviced by bank personnel in utah  until they are paid off or sold 
at december   the remaining utah loan and deposits totaled million and million  respectively 
on march   the bank entered into a definitive agreement to sell its twenty full service branches in colorado 
the sale of the branches  which is subject to regulatory approval  is expected to close late in the second quarter of while management believes that the sale of the colorado branches will close  the definitive agreement provides the purchaser with walk away provisions in the event of a material adverse change  including a decline in deposits below million 
after the write off of the associated core deposit intangible  and transaction costs  the transaction is expected to generate a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the aggregate carrying amounts at december   of the loans  deposits  and fixed assets to be transferred were million  million  and million  respectively 
we believe that the sale of the colorado branches and the subsequent reduction in the overall level of loans will return us to well capitalized status at june  we also expect that the colorado sale combined with other potential loan sales and normal loan amortization and repayments will help us achieve a tier leverage ratio above and a total risk based capital ratio above at the bank as requested under the informal agreement  but the timing is uncertain 
this transaction  combined with the potential sale of other loans and normal loan amortization and repayments should also help us achieve a total risk based capital ratio above at the company  however  there is no assurance that the company and the bank will reach or maintain the capital levels currently deemed necessary by the regulators 
see note  subsequent event of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the colorado sale 
management and operating strategy our management strategy is to provide a business culture in which customers are provided individualized customer service 
we believe that we differentiate ourselves through this responsive customer service  our streamlined management structure  and management s and employees strong community involvement in our business locations 
we believe we can continue to attract employees and management teams who are not satisfied by working at larger organizations 
since  large out of state financial institutions have acquired several banks that compete with us 
these institutions concentrate on the mass retail customer base and extremely large customers 
they also tend to reduce service levels to small to medium size businesses 
these institutions method of doing business affords us a continuing opportunity to gain profitable new account relationships and to expand existing relationships by positioning ourselves as a local responsive alternative to the impersonal service of the larger banks 
in order to realize our objectives  we are pursuing the following strategies improvement of capital ratios 
since mid  we have taken extensive actions to bolster our capital ratios  in an effort to protect depositors and shareholders from various factors affecting the commercial banking 
table of contents industry 
the actions taken include  among others  the suspension of dividend payments to shareholders in july and a significant altering of our loan growth strategy see internal growth below 
in addition  we are focused on reductions in certain non interest expenses and improvement in non interest income  in an effort to increase profitability 
because we do not believe we currently have the ability to raise new capital at an acceptable price given current market conditions  we have been actively working on initiatives to reduce our balance sheet in the near term to increase total risk based capital at the bank to the requested under the informal agreement 
these initiatives have been focused primarily on the sale of individual loans or pools of loans  and on march   resulted in the execution of a definitive agreement to sell the bank s twenty full service branches in colorado 
see recent company developments above 
we believe that the sale of the colorado branches and the subsequent reduction in the overall level of loans will return us to well capitalized status at june  we also expect that the colorado sale combined with other potential loan sales and normal loan amortization and repayments will help us achieve a tier leverage ratio above and a total risk based capital ratio above at the bank as requested under the informal agreement  but the timing is uncertain 
this transaction  combined with the potential sale of other loans and normal loan amortization and repayments should also help us achieve a total risk based capital ratio above at the company  however  there is no assurance that the company and the bank will reach or maintain the capital levels currently deemed necessary by the regulators 
internal growth 
we believe that our markets provide us with significant opportunities for internal growth 
once the sale of the colorado branches is complete  we will focus on attracting core deposits from individuals  local businesses  and governments in new mexico and arizona 
given the current focus on capital  new loan requests of any significant size are limited to existing customers or potential new customers who would maintain substantial deposit relationships with us 
over the next several years  we expect growth to be organic  with efforts intensified in arizona and our legacy new mexico markets 
selective de novo branch openings will be concentrated in arizona  focusing on the greater phoenix metropolitan market 
we consider a variety of criteria when evaluating potential branch expansion  including i the short and long term growth prospects for the location  ii the management and other resources required to integrate the operations  if desirable  iii the degree to which the branch would enhance our geographic diversification  iv the degree to which the branch would enhance our presence in an existing market  and v the costs of operating the branch 
customer service 
our objective is to increase market share in new mexico and arizona  with our current focus on deposits  by providing responsive customer service that is tailored to our customers needs 
by maximizing personal contact with customers  maintaining low employee turnover  and endeavoring to understand the needs and preferences of our customers  we are working to maintain and further enhance our reputation for providing excellent customer service 
we have developed a streamlined management structure that allows us to make decisions rapidly 
we believe that this structure  when compared to other competing institutions  enables us to provide a higher degree of service and increased flexibility to our customers 
employees 
we recognize that our individual employees are the core of our overall business strategy 
we are committed to providing a workplace environment in which the individual employee is valued and respected 
we have strategically hired and promoted within the bank and although we have tightened the lending authority due to current market conditions  we continue to provide each region with sufficient local decision making ability which allows us to better serve and attract small to medium size businesses 
new account relationships 
we emphasize relationship banking with local businesses  local governments  and individual customers across all product lines 
we intend to continue to target our marketing efforts to those businesses  governments  and individuals who prefer our personalized customer service  combined with our emphasis on local decision making and the delivery of a state of the art array of products and services 
community involvement 
first community bank s management and other employees participate actively in a wide variety of civic and community activities and organizations 
first community bank s management also 
table of contents sponsors a number of community oriented programs and events each year  contributing approximately million to these organizations in we believe that these activities assist first community bank through increased visibility and through development and maintenance of customer relationships 
maintaining asset quality 
we aggressively manage the exposure in our loan portfolio with particular attention focused on our construction portfolio including residential construction as well as commercial real estate construction 
approximately of our loan portfolio remains heavily concentrated in the real estate market 
in addition  we proactively work with borrowers as we see potential signs of deterioration in collateral values or general market conditions 
while our lenders are primarily responsible for identifying potential problem loans  we also have a fully outsourced loan review function 
we believe that this outsourcing allows for a more efficient and independent assessment of potential credit weakness 
although we experienced a significant increase during in the level of non performing loans and charge offs  our non performing loans are largely secured by real estate which has historically limited our potential loss exposure 
we believe that adhering to our strict underwriting criteria has helped mitigate our loss exposure as well 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nonperforming assets and analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
increasing efficiency 
we believe that our investments in technology will continue to produce operational efficiencies over the next few years 
we have recently implemented full loan file imaging and workflow technology throughout the organization which is providing greater efficiencies in our lending processes 
we have completed a major data communications infrastructure upgrade which has significantly reduced our leased data line costs 
we are also completing a major server virtualization and database consolidation project which reduces the number of servers required to run our applications and also affords significant energy savings in our data center 
all of our locations are linked together by a private voice and data network eliminating long distance costs for intracompany phone calls and data transmission 
we have implemented thin client desktops  thin client laptops  ip telephony  and vpn technology  all of which allow bank employees greater communication flexibility throughout the organization as well as increasing worker productivity  while reducing support and maintenance costs 
our internal single sign on project has been successfully completed which has reduced password support calls and made our systems more secure 
we have implemented significant enhancements to our automated banking channels to better serve both our retail and commercial customers 
we continue to experience operating efficiencies by leveraging the technologies brought about by the check act with the addition of electronic check clearing in addition to all of our branch locations utilizing remote check capture and imaged deposit and loan workflow technologies 
our merchant remote capture product  digipost  continues to aid us in gaining market share in markets with fewer branch locations 
we are strategically focusing on improving processes and workflows of our existing systems as well as evaluating future and emerging technologies 
we believe these investments will allow us to expand our asset base in the future without a commensurate increase in non interest expenses 
asset liability management 
our asset liability management policy is designed to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting our earnings from undue interest rate risk 
we maintain a strategy of keeping the rate adjustment period on the majority of both assets and liabilities to an earnings neutral position  with a substantial amount of these assets and liabilities adjustable in days or less

table of contents supervision and regulation first state bancorporation 
we are a bank holding company subject to the supervision  examination  and regulation of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act the bhca 
the bhca and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities  including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations 
as a bank holding company  our activities and those of our banking subsidiary are limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking  and we may not directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company  including a bank  without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 
supervision and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the deposit insurance funds of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic  and the banking system as a whole  not for the protection of bank holding company stockholders or creditors 
the banking regulatory agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks  including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violation of laws and regulations 
see recent company developments above for information regarding an informal agreement between first state bancorporation  first community bank  and our regulators 
on january   the federal reserve board s revised bank holding company rating system became effective 
the revised system more closely aligns the federal reserve s rating process with the focus of its current supervisory practices by placing an increased emphasis on risk management  providing a more flexible and comprehensive framework for evaluating financial condition  and requiring an explicit determination of the likelihood that the non depository entities of a bank holding company will have a significant negative impact on the depository subsidiaries 
under the revised rating system  each bank holding company is assigned a composite rating based on an evaluation and rating of three essential components of an institution s financial condition and operations 
these three components are risk management  financial condition  and potential impact of the parent company and non depository subsidiaries on the subsidiary depository institutions 
a fourth rating  depository institution  mirrors the primary regulator s assessment of the subsidiary depository institutions 
first community bank 
as a new mexico chartered state member bank of the federal reserve system  first community bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board and the new mexico financial institutions division  and  as a result of the insurance of its deposits  by the fdic 
almost every aspect of the operations and financial condition of first community bank is subject to extensive regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law  including requirements governing capital adequacy  liquidity  earnings  dividends  reserves against deposits  management practices  branching  loans  investments  and the provision of services 
various consumer protection laws and regulations also affect the operations of first community bank 
the deposits of first community bank are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic 
see recent company developments above for information regarding an informal agreement between first state bancorporation  first community bank  and our regulators 
holding company liability 
under federal reserve board policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support 
this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when  absent this federal reserve policy  we may not be inclined to provide it 
as discussed below under prompt corrective action  a bank holding company in certain circumstances also could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary 
in addition  any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  the trustee will be deemed to have assumed and is required to cure immediately any deficit under any commitment 
table of contents by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution  and any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims 
payment of dividends 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies 
the policy statement provides that  as a matter of prudent banking  a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends  and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
accordingly  a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company s financial health  such as by borrowing 
in addition  as noted above  bank holding companies are expected under federal reserve board policy to serve as a source of financial strength for their depository institution subsidiaries 
this requirement  and the capital adequacy requirements applicable to bank holding companies  described below under capital adequacy requirements  may also limit our ability to pay dividends 
see recent company developments above for information regarding an informal agreement between first state bancorporation  first community bank  and our regulators and restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
as a bank holding company  we are a legal entity separate and distinct from first community bank 
our principal asset is the outstanding capital stock of first community bank 
as a result  our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will depend primarily on the ability of first community bank to pay dividends to us in amounts in excess of the amounts required to service our obligations 
dividend payments from first community bank are subject to federal and state limitations  generally based on the capital level and current and retained earnings of the bank 
approval of the federal reserve board is required  for example  for payment of any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years 
first community bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its net profits 
first community bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized 
in addition  the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the payment of dividends could  depending on the financial condition of first community bank  be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
under new mexico law  first community bank may not pay a dividend on its common stock unless its remaining surplus after payment of such dividend is equal to at least of its minimum common capital requirement 
first community bank is also prohibited from paying dividends from undivided profits if its reserves against deposits are impaired or will become impaired as a result of such payment 
in order to help improve the company s and the bank s capital ratios  we suspended our cash dividend payments to shareholders in july  and the bank has not declared a cash dividend to the company since may the company and first community bank are both currently precluded from paying dividends pursuant to the informal agreement 
see recent company developments above 
capital adequacy requirements 
we are subject to the federal reserve board s risk based capital and leverage guidelines for bank holding companies 
the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain off balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit  is 
at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders equity including retained earnings  trust preferred securities  qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and  for bank holding companies only  a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  other disallowed intangibles  and disallowed deferred tax assets  among other items tier capital 
the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  other perpetual preferred stock  hybrid capital instruments  mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements  as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses tier 
table of contents capital 
the maximum amount of tier capital that may be included in an organization s qualifying total capital is limited to of tier capital 
the federal reserve board has also adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies  requiring tier capital of at least of average total consolidated assets 
see recent company developments above for information regarding an informal agreement between first state bancorporation  first community bank  and our regulators and requested capital ratios at the bank level 
our subsidiary  first community bank  also is subject to risk based and leverage capital guidelines of the federal reserve board which are similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies 
as discussed below under enforcement powers of the federal regulatory agencies  failure to meet the minimum regulatory capital requirements could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities  including  in most severe cases  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and the placement of the institution into conservatorship or receivership 
the capital ratios for first state bancorporation and first community bank are provided in the chart below 
risk based capital and leverage ratios as of december  risk based ratios tier i capital total capital leverage ratio first state bancorporation first community bank minimum required ratio well capitalized minimum ratio the federal bank regulatory agencies risk based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria  assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating 
banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios 
the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant 
federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
in addition  the regulations of the federal reserve board provide that concentration of credit risk  interest rate risk  and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization s overall capital adequacy 
the risk based capital regulations also provide for the consideration of interest rate risk in the agencies determination of a banking institution s capital adequacy 
the regulations require such institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain capital adequate for that risk 
the regulatory capital calculation limits the amount of allowance for loan losses that is included in capital to percent of risk weighted assets 
at december   the company and the bank had approximately million of allowance for loan losses which was excluded from regulatory capital

prompt corrective action 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions 
depository institutions  such as first community bank  are assigned one of five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls 
under certain circumstances  a well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 
a 
table of contents depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept  renew  or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic  and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits 
undercapitalized institutions may not accept  renew  or roll over brokered deposits 
the banking regulatory agencies are permitted or  in certain cases  required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories 
depending on the level of an institution s capital  the agencies corrective powers include  among other things prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt  prohibiting the holding company from making distributions without prior regulatory approval  placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities  placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates  restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits  prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks  and in the most severe cases  appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution 
a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan  and such a plan will not be accepted unless  among other things  the banking institution s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount 
any such guarantee from a depository institution s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy 
failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies  including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and to certain restrictions on business 
as of december   both first state bancorporation and first community bank were considered adequately capitalized and are currently subject to an informal agreement with the regulators 
see recent company developments above 
although management believes that the company and the bank are in substantial compliance with the terms of the informal agreement  there can be no assurance that the company and the bank will remain in substantial compliance and that there will not be further action by the regulators 
enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 
the federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations  and supervisory agreements could subject first state bancorporation or first community bank  as well as officers  directors  and other institution affiliated parties of these organizations  to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil monetary penalties 
in addition to the grounds discussed under prompt corrective action  the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself  under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist  including  without limitation  where the banking institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized  fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so  fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan  or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan 
control acquisitions 
the change in bank control act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the federal reserve board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction 
under a rebuttable presumption established by the federal reserve board  the acquisition of or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities 
table of contents registered under section of the securities exchange act of  such as first state bancorporation  would  under the circumstances set forth in the presumption  constitute acquisition of control of first state bancorporation 
in addition  any company is required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board under the bhca before acquiring in the case of an acquiror that is a bank holding company or more of the outstanding common stock of first state bancorporation  or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over first state bancorporation 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders 
first community bank is subject to restrictions under federal law that limits certain transactions with affiliates  including loans  other extensions of credit  investments  or asset purchases 
such transactions by a banking subsidiary with any one affiliate are limited in amount to of the bank s capital and surplus and  with all affiliates together  to an aggregate of of the bank s capital and surplus 
furthermore  such loans and extensions of credit  as well as certain other transactions  are required to be secured in specified amounts 
these and certain other transactions  including any payment of money to us  must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies

the policies of regulatory authorities  especially the monetary policy of the federal reserve board  have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
among the means available to the federal reserve board to affect the money supply are open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
these means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments and deposits  and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 
federal reserve board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on our business and earnings cannot be predicted

we do not currently have any qualifying senior unsecured debt 
as of december   the fdic insurance premiums were calculated on a risk based assessment system that enabled the fdic to tie each bank s premiums to the risk it poses to the deposit insurance

future legislation 
legislation is from time to time introduced in congress and state legislatures with respect to the regulation of financial institutions 
such legislation may change the banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways 
we cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation  if enacted  or implementing regulations  would have upon our financial condition or our results of operations

item a risk factors 
forward looking statements certain statements in this form k are forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
these statements are based on management s current expectations or predictions of future results or events 
we make these forward looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor provisions provided under the private securities litigation reform act of all statements  other than statements of historical fact  included in this report which relate to performance  development or activities that we expect or anticipate will or may happen in the future  are forward looking statements 
the discussions regarding our growth strategy  expansion of operations in our markets  acquisitions  dispositions  competition  loan and deposit growth or decline  timing of new branch openings  capital expectations  and response to consolidation in the banking industry include forward looking statements 
other forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words such as believe  expect  may  might  will  should  seek  could  approximately  intend  plan  estimate  or anticipate or the negative of those words or other similar expressions 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and are based on numerous assumptions 
they are not guarantees of future performance 
a number of important factors could cause actual 
table of contents results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statement 
some factors include changes in interest rates  local business conditions  government regulations  lack of available credit  lack of confidence in the financial markets  loss of key personnel or inability to hire suitable personnel  faster or slower than anticipated growth  economic conditions  our competitors responses to our marketing strategy or new competitive conditions  and competition in the geographic and business areas in which we conduct our operations 
forward looking statements contained herein are made only as of the date made  and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
because forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  we caution that there are important factors  in addition to those listed above  that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
these factors include the following there can be no assurance that the recently enacted emergency economic stabilization act of will help stabilize the us financial system  and the expiration of programs implemented under such legislation may have unintended adverse effects on us 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets  on october   president bush signed the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury has the authority  among other things  to purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets 
the us treasury and the bank regulatory agencies have also announced coordinated programs to invest an aggregate of billion out of the billion in capital issued by qualifying us financial institutions and to guarantee senior debt of all fdic insured institutions and their qualifying holding companies  as well as deposits in non interest bearing transaction accounts 
the capital purchase program involves the issuance by qualifying institutions of preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to the us treasury 
the us federal government has taken or is considering taking other actions to address the financial crises that could further impact our business 
there can be no assurance regarding the actual impact that the eesa or these programs will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of the eesa and these programs to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to capital or the trading price of our common stock 
even if legislative or regulatory efforts successfully stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets  we may need to modify our strategies and business operations 
we may also incur increased capital requirements and constraints or additional costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements 
given the volatile nature of the current market disruption and the uncertainties underlying efforts to mitigate or reverse the disruption  we may not timely anticipate or manage existing  new or additional risks  contingencies or developments in the current or future environment 
our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
to the extent that we qualify and participate in these programs or other programs  there is no assurance that such programs will remain available for sufficient periods of time or on acceptable terms to benefit us  and the expiration of such programs could have unintended adverse effects on us 
current market developments may adversely affect our industry  business  results of operations and access to capital 
dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in higher levels of non performing assets and significant write 
table of contents downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks 
these increased levels of non performing assets and write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities  in turn have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have ceased to provide funding to even the most credit worthy borrowers or to other financial institutions 
the resulting lack of available credit and lack of confidence in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our access to capital 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events the processes we use to estimate inherent losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future charge offs 
our ability to borrow or otherwise raise capital from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations 
we expect to face increased regulation of our industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs  limit our ability to pursue business opportunities  and increase compliance challenges 
it may be difficult to trade our shares if we are unable to maintain our listing on the nasdaq stock market or if our stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules of the securities and exchange commission sec 
our shares are currently listed with nasdaq on its global select market 
this listing is dependent on us maintaining certain minimum listing standards  including  among others  minimum bid price and stockholders equity standards 
if we continue to incur losses as we did in and cannot maintain the standards for continued listing on the nasdaq global select market  our common stock could be subject to delisting 
trading in our common stock could then be conducted on the over the counter market on the otc bulletin board  and we could become subject to the penny stock rules maintained by the sec 
these rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers 
the additional sales practice requirements could materially adversely affect the willingness or ability of broker dealers to sell our common stock 
as a result  it may be difficult to sell shares or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of our shares 
in addition  it may be more difficult for us to obtain additional equity financing due to liquidity concerns of potential investors 
recently  our share price has been below  but not for thirty consecutive business days  the determining time for failure to meet the minimum bid price on nasdaq 
we have not received a notice from nasdaq concerning our trading price and nasdaq has suspended its rules requiring a minimum bid price until july  we believe we are currently in compliance with all other listing standards applicable to us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance or that the nasdaq stock market will not revise the standards in a way that would make it more difficult for us to comply 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients  resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry 
table of contents overall 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we become the subject of rumors or questions regarding our financial soundness 
we operate in a highly regulated environment  changes in federal and state laws and regulations and accounting principles may adversely affect us 
we are a bank holding company 
bank holding companies and their subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated environment  subject to extensive supervision and examination by federal and state bank regulatory agencies 
we are subject to changes in federal and state law  as well as changes in regulation and governmental policies  income tax law  and accounting principles 
any change in applicable regulations  or federal or state legislation  or in accounting principles could have a significant impact on us and our results of operations 
additional legislation or regulations  including the eesa and any other legislation or regulation that could be brought about by the current credit and liquidity crisis  may significantly affect our powers  authority  and operations 
if new legislation  regulations  or accounting principles are enacted or adopted  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
in particular  we are subject to the bank holding company act of  as amended  and to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board 
first community bank  as a state member bank of the federal reserve system  is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board and the new mexico financial institutions division of the regulation and licensing department and  because its deposits are insured  by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
our operations in colorado and arizona may also be subject to regulation and supervision by the state of colorado division of banking  and the arizona state banking department  respectively 
regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of the regulators supervisory and enforcement duties 
if regulators exercise these powers  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the federal reserve board has a policy stating that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank 
under this doctrine  the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank 
a capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may be required to borrow the funds or otherwise obtain the funds from external sources 
as a result of the most recent safety and soundness examination of the company and our subsidiary first community bank  which was conducted jointly by the federal reserve and the new mexico financial institutions division  we entered into an informal agreement on september  under the terms of the informal agreement  we agreed  among other things  to formulate a written plan to maintain a sufficient capital position at the bank and at the company  including attaining a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of at the bank level  with no date specified for achieving those levels 
in addition  the company and the bank have agreed to maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  not to pay any dividends  not to distribute any interest  principal or other sums on trust preferred securities  not to issue or guarantee any debt or trust preferred securities  and not to purchase or redeem any shares of the company s stock 
this informal agreement can be terminated by a joint decision between the regulators if they conclude such action is warranted 
the value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions and a decrease in value could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
we classify investment securities in one of three categories and account for them as follows debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and 
table of contents carried at amortized cost  debt and equity securities that are bought and held primarily for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings  and debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities 
these are securities that we will hold for an indefinite period of time and may be used as a part of our asset liability management strategy and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  prepayments  or similar factors 
available for sale securities are carried at estimated market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of related deferred income taxes 
upon purchase of investment securities  management designates securities as either held to maturity or available for sale 
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are calculated using a method that approximates the effective interest method 
declines in the fair value of individual investment securities held to maturity and available for sale below their cost that are other than temporary are recorded as write downs of the individual securities to their fair value and the related write downs are included in earnings as realized losses 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we review our investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other than temporary 
this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment 
we conduct this review on a quarterly basis  using both quantitative and qualitative factors  to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary 
such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  recommendations of investment advisors  and forecasts of economic  market  or industry trends 
this review process also entails an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold individual securities until they mature or full cost can be recovered 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of the securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets 
during the twelve months ended december   we recorded the following charges for other than temporary impairment of securities an impairment charge in the first quarter of of  on fhlmc preferred stock  an impairment charge in the third quarter of of an additional  on such fhlmc preferred stock  and an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of of an additional  on such fhlmc preferred stock 
over time  the economic and market environment may further deteriorate or provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities  which could change our judgment regarding impairment 
this could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines recorded as an expense 
given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved  there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other than temporary impairments may result in realized losses in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
defaults in the repayment of loans may negatively affect our business 
a borrower s default on its obligations under one or more of our loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work out of the loan 
in certain situations  where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work out arrangements cannot be reached  we may have to write off the loan in whole or in part 
in these situations  we may acquire real estate or other assets  if any  which secure the loan through foreclosure or other similar available remedies 
in these cases  the amount owed under the defaulted loan often exceeds the value of the assets acquired 
we regularly make a determination of an allowance for loan losses based on available information  including the quality of and trends in our loan portfolio  economic conditions  the value of the underlying collateral  historical charge offs  and the level of our non accruing loans 
provisions for this allowance result in an expense for the period 
given the current economic conditions and trends  management believes we will 
table of contents continue to experience credit deterioration and higher levels of nonperforming loans in the near term  which may cause us to continue to have negative earnings or otherwise adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   our allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans held for investment 
our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or further adverse developments arise with respect to our nonperforming or performing loans 
material additions to our allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowances for loan losses and the values we attribute to real estate acquired through foreclosure or other similar remedies 
these regulatory agencies may require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items 
if we are required to adjust our allowances for loan losses  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our profitability depends significantly on local and overall economic conditions 
our success is dependent to a significant extent upon local economic conditions in the communities we serve and the general economic conditions in the united states 
the economic conditions  including real estate values  in these areas and throughout the united states  have a significant impact on loan demand  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans  and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
the current decline in general economic conditions  including the decline in real estate values  has resulted in an increase in our nonperforming assets and an increase in our charge offs on defaulted loans during a further decline in economic conditions  including depressed real estate values  over a prolonged period of time in any of these areas could cause additional significant increases in nonperforming assets and could continue to affect our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral  which could continue to cause decreased operating results  liquidity  and capital 
as of december   approximately of the book value of our loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by various types of real estate 
our loan portfolio is currently concentrated in new mexico  colorado  utah  and arizona 
adverse economic conditions in these states could have a greater effect on our ability to attract deposits and result in high rates of loss and delinquency on our loan portfolio compared to competitors who may have more geographic diversification 
we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers unless we have sufficient liquidity 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
our liquidity is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
we regularly monitor our overall liquidity position to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity 
without sufficient liquidity from these potential sources  we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers 
also  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the recent disruption and illiquidity in the credit markets are continuing challenges that have generally made potential funding sources more difficult to access  less reliable  and more expensive 
in addition  liquidity in the inter bank market  as well as the markets for commercial paper  certificates of deposits  and other short term instruments have significantly contracted 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
these market conditions 
table of contents have made the management of our own and our customers liquidity significantly more challenging 
at december   all outstanding borrowings with the fhlb were collateralized by a blanket pledge agreement on the company s loan portfolio 
subsequent to december   the fhlb notified the company that its blanket lien will be replaced by a custody arrangement  whereby the fhlb will have custody and endorsement of the loans that collateralize its fhlb borrowings 
management believes that we have sufficient loan and investment securities collateral to deliver to the fhlb to fully secure existing borrowings 
however  as the collateral values are determined subjectively by the fhlb  there is no assurance that the fhlb will not require additional collateral or repayment of existing borrowings 
a further deterioration in the credit markets or a prolonged period without improvement of market liquidity could adversely affect our liquidity and financial position  including our regulatory capital ratios  and could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and prospects 
supervisory guidance on commercial real estate concentrations could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business 
the office of the comptroller of the currency  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  and the federal deposit insurance corporation have joint supervisory guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the guidance is intended to help ensure that institutions pursuing a significant commercial real estate lending strategy remain healthy and profitable while continuing to serve the credit needs of their communities 
the agencies are concerned that rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets 
the guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending 
the guidance provides supervisory criteria  including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 
the guidance does not limit banks commercial real estate lending  but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations 
the lending and risk management practices will be taken into account in supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy 
our commercial real estate portfolio as of december   meets the definition of commercial real estate concentration as set forth in the final guidelines 
if our risk management practices are found to be deficient  it could result in increased reserves and capital costs 
our small to medium sized business customers may have less financial resources with which to weather a downturn in the economy 
one of the primary focal points of our business development and marketing strategy is serving the banking and financial services needs of small to medium sized businesses 
small to medium sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
commercial loans  including commercial real estate loans  are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending 
because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation of the property or business involved  repayment of such loans is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy 
accordingly  the recent downturn in the real estate market and the economy has heightened our risk related to commercial loans  particularly commercial real estate loans 
if general economic conditions worsen in new mexico  colorado  utah  or arizona  the businesses of our customers and their ability to repay outstanding loans may be further negatively affected 
as a consequence  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability 
our net interest income may be reduced by changes in the interest rate environment 
our earnings depend to a significant extent on the interest rate differential 
the interest rate differential or spread is the difference between the interest earned on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  
table of contents borrowings  and other interest bearing liabilities 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
in particular  changes in the discount rate by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve usually lead to changes in interest rates  which affect our interest income  interest expense  and securities portfolio 
net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
we cannot assure you that we can minimize our interest rate risk 
in addition  an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread  asset quality  loan origination volume  which may cause us to continue to have negative earnings or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our net income is affected by our interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is the difference between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
interest rate sensitivity is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
since the middle of  and as of december   the federal reserve has lowered the discount rate basis points which has negatively impacted our interest spread 
as of december   our cumulative interest rate gap for the period up to three months was a positive million 
the most recent rate cut in december  which affected the prime rate by basis points  will again negatively impact our interest spread 
if additional rate decreases occur  our results of operations and financial condition may be further adversely affected 
our loans are currently concentrated in new mexico  colorado  utah  and arizona and adverse conditions in those markets could adversely affect operations 
because our loans and deposits are in only a few concentrated geographic areas  our business may be more affected by local economic conditions and could be more vulnerable than banks whose lending and deposit activities are in larger  more geographically diversified markets 
a prolonged or more extreme downturn in the local economies in new mexico  colorado  utah  or arizona could have further adverse effects on business activity  employment  and collateral values  with a corresponding adverse effect on loan growth  income  and on borrowers abilities to repay loans 
the current economic recession and deterioration in the real estate markets have had an adverse effect on the collateral value for many of our loans and on the repayment ability of many of our borrowers 
the continuation or further deterioration of these factors  including increasing foreclosures and unemployment  will continue to have the same or similar adverse effects 
in addition  these factors could reduce the amount of loans we make to businesses in the construction and real estate industry  which could negatively impact our interest income and results of operations 
a continued significant decline in real estate values could also lead to higher charge offs in the event of defaults in our real estate loan portfolio 
similarly  the occurrence of a natural or manmade disaster in our market areas could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans 
any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
our real estate construction loan portfolio may expose us to increased credit risk 
at december   our portfolio of real estate construction loans totaled million or of total loans 
approximately of these loans are related to residential construction and approximately are for commercial purposes or vacant land 
during and  the housing markets declined  evidenced by excess lot inventory and higher levels of completed unsold housing inventory 
the decline in the housing market  sub prime loan crisis  and tightening of credit markets has led to higher than normal foreclosure rates on a national level 
of the states that we operate in  arizona  where we have the lowest dollar amount of real estate construction loans  has had the largest downturn in the residential real estate market 
although new mexico  
table of contents colorado  and utah have not experienced as significant a downturn in the residential real estate market  foreclosure rates have had a ripple effect on the construction industry as well as the acquisition and development sectors exposing us to increased credit risk within our construction loan portfolio 
banking regulations may restrict our ability to pay dividends 
although we hold all of the outstanding capital stock of first community bank  we are a legal entity separate and distinct from first community bank 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or service our obligations will depend primarily on the ability of first community bank to pay dividends to us 
first community bank s ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions to us is governed by federal and state law 
federal and state regulatory limitations on a bank s dividends generally are based on the bank s capital levels and current and retained earnings 
the earnings of first community bank may not be sufficient to make capital distributions to us in an amount sufficient for us to service our obligations or to pay dividends on our common stock 
during the third quarter of  we suspended the payment of interest on all of our existing trust preferred securities  pursuant to the informal agreement 
first community bank is prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized 
it is the policy of the federal reserve board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available from the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
federal reserve board policy also provides that bank holding companies should not maintain such a level of cash dividends that would undermine the bank holding company s ability to provide financial resources as needed to its insured banking subsidiaries 
additionally  the federal reserve board has the right to object to a distribution on safety and soundness grounds 
depending upon the circumstances  the federal reserve board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the company and first community bank are both currently precluded from paying dividends pursuant to the informal agreement 
there is no assurance that the company or first community bank will be able or permitted to resume paying dividends 
the terms of our trust preferred securities may restrict our ability to pay dividends 
the terms of our trust preferred securities allow us to suspend payments of interest  at our option  for up to five years 
however  if we exercise our option to suspend those payments  we will be prohibited from paying any dividends on any class of capital stock for as long as the trust preferred interest payments remain suspended 
during the third quarter of  we suspended the payment of interest on all of our existing trust preferred securities  pursuant to the informal agreement 
our ability to make interest payments on the trust preferred securities is highly dependent on receiving dividends from first community bank 
there is no assurance that we will be able to resume making the interest payments 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability 
the banking business is highly competitive  and our profitability depends upon our ability to compete in our market areas 
we compete with other commercial and savings banks and savings and loan associations 
we also compete with credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms  asset based non bank lenders  and governmental organizations that may offer subsidized financing at lower rates than those we offer 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
although we have been able to compete effectively in the past  we may not be able to compete effectively in the future 
our large competitors may also in the future attempt to respond directly to our marketing strategy by emphasizing similar services 

table of contents we may not be able to manage risks inherent in our business  particularly given the recent turbulent and dynamic market conditions 
a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function is essential for our business 
we have adopted various policies  procedures  and systems to monitor and manage risk  including risk associated with our nonperforming assets 
these policies  procedures  and systems may be inadequate to identify and mitigate all risks inherent in our business 
in addition  our business and the markets and industry in which we operate are continuously evolving 
we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in our business or the financial markets and fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes  particularly given the recent turbulent and dynamic market conditions 
if our risk framework is ineffective  either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets or in our business or for other reasons  we could incur losses and otherwise experience harm to our business 
environmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses 
in the course of our business  we may acquire through foreclosure properties securing loans that are in default 
particularly in commercial real estate lending  there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties 
in this event  under some circumstances we might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense 
the cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of the affected properties 
we may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties  and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties 
if we experience these difficulties  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our success has been and continues to be largely dependent on the services of michael r 
stanford  our president and chief executive officer  h 
patrick dee  our executive vice president and treasurer  christopher c 
spencer  our senior vice president and chief financial officer  and other members of management who have significant relationships with our customers 
the prolonged unavailability or the unexpected loss of any of these officers could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
our restated articles of incorporation  our bylaws  and new mexico law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us by a third party 
our restated articles of incorporation  our bylaws  and new mexico law contain provisions that make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and may make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect your own representatives as directors and take other corporate actions 
our restated articles of incorporation also prohibit business combinations with a person who acquires or more of any class of our equity securities  including our common stock  unless the acquiror receives prior approval for the business combination from at least of the votes entitled to vote at a meeting of our shareholders held to vote on the proposed business combination 
this provision in our restated articles of incorporation is in addition to the limitations that new mexico law provides that may discourage potential acquirors from purchasing shares of our common stock 
under new mexico law  our directors may consider the interest of persons other than our shareholders when faced with unsolicited offers for control of us 
for example  our directors may consider the interest of our employees  suppliers  creditors  the communities we serve  and the state of new mexico generally in evaluating any change of control offer 
these and other provisions of new mexico law and our governing documents may have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of our shareholders 

table of contents we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
the success of acquisitions depends  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities  economies of scale  and other benefits from combining of operations into ours 
to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions  our management team must develop strategies and implement business plans that will successfully combine the businesses 
if we do not realize economies of scale and other anticipated benefits as a result of acquisitions  the value of our common stock may decline 
an extended disruption of our vital infrastructure could negatively impact our operations  results  and financial condition 
our operations depend upon  among other things  our infrastructure  including equipment  information and telecommunications technologies  and facilities 
an extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire  power loss  computer hacking or viruses  terrorist activity  natural disaster  telecommunications failure  or other events beyond our control could impact the financial services industry as a whole and our business 
our business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations 
rapid technological changes may adversely affect the value of our current or future technologies to us and our customers  which could cause us to increase expenditures to upgrade and protect our technology or develop and protect competing technologies for delivering our services 
technology in our industry is evolving rapidly 
our ability to compete and our future results depend in part on our ability to make timely and cost effective enhancements and additions to our technology  to introduce new products and services that meet customer demands  and to keep pace with rapid advancements in technology 
maintaining flexibility to respond to technological and market dynamics may require substantial expenditures and lead time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify and develop new products or services in a timely manner  that offerings  technologies  or services developed by others will not render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive  or that the technologies in which we focus our investments will achieve acceptance in the marketplace and provide a return on our investment 
material breaches of our systems may have a significant effect on our business 
we collect  process  and store sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both us and third party service providers 
we have security  backup and recovery systems in place  as well as a business continuity plan to ensure the system will not be inoperable 
we also have security to prevent unauthorized access to the system 
in addition  we require our third party service providers to maintain similar controls 
however  we cannot be certain that the measures will be successful 
a security breach in the system and loss of confidential information such as credit card numbers and related information could result in losing the customers confidence and thus the loss of their business
