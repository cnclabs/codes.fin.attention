item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the general nature of our business is a motorsports themed amusement enterprise  furnishing amusement to the public in the form of motorsports themed entertainment 
we derive revenues primarily from i admissions to motorsports events and motorsports themed amusement activities held at our facilities  ii revenue generated in conjunction with or as a result of motorsports events and motorsports themed amusement activities conducted at our facilities  and iii catering  concession and merchandising services during or as a result of these events and amusement activities 
admissions  net revenue includes ticket sales for all of our racing events  activities at daytona experience and other motorsports activities and amusements  net of any applicable taxes 
motorsports related revenue primarily includes television and ancillary media rights fees  promotion and sponsorship fees  hospitality rentals including luxury suites  chalets and the hospitality portion of club seating  advertising revenues  royalties from licenses of our trademarks and track rentals 
food  beverage and merchandise revenue includes revenues from concession stands  direct sales of souvenirs  hospitality catering  programs and other merchandise and fees paid by third party vendors for the right to occupy space to sell souvenirs and concessions at our motorsports entertainment facilities 
direct expenses include i prize and point fund monies and nascar sanction fees  ii motorsports related expenses  which include labor  advertising  costs of competition paid to sanctioning bodies other than nascar and other expenses associated with the promotion of all of our motorsports events and activities  and iii food  beverage and merchandise expenses  consisting primarily of labor and costs of goods sold 
at the beginning of fiscal  entitlement of two of nascar s premiere series changed 
the nascar nextel cup series became the nascar sprint cup series and the nascar busch series became the nascar nationwide series 
throughout this document  the naming convention for these series is consistent with the branding in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made  actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
we consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
our judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity includes assessing our level of involvement in establishing the entity  determining whether we provide more than half of any management  operational or financial support to the entity  and determining if we absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or returns 
we apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee 
our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees 
our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest  board representation and policy making decisions 
we periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary 
we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition 
advance ticket sales and event related revenues for future events are deferred until earned  which is generally once the events are conducted 
the recognition of event related expenses is matched with the recognition of event related revenues 
nascar contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire nascar sprint cup and nationwide series schedules as well as the nascar craftsman truck series schedule beginning in fiscal year event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and craftsman truck series event 
under the terms of this arrangement  nascar retains percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and craftsman truck series event as a component of its sanction fees and remits the remaining percent to the event promoter 
the event promoter pays percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event as part of awards to the competitors 
our revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts  with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time 
some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and or events and include multiple specified elements  such as tickets  hospitality chalets  suites  display space and signage for each included event 
the allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements  events and facilities is based on relative fair value 
the sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted 
revenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers  internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale 
accounts receivable 
we regularly review the collectability of our accounts receivable 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectability of accounts 
business combinations 
all business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method 
whether net assets or common stock is acquired  fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired including recognized intangibles is recorded as goodwill 
business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract based intangible asset associated with long term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies  such as nascar  grand american and or irl 
the continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year 
while individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year  a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 are recorded as indefinite lived intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill 
capitalization and depreciation policies 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
when we construct assets  we capitalize costs of the project  including  but not limited to  certain pre acquisition costs  permitting costs  fees paid to architects and contractors  certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary  property taxes and interest 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets  industry  legal and regulatory factors  and our expectations of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
interest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or construction project 
we capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin and cease when such activities are 
table of contents substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised of assets having finite useful lives  which are amortized over that period  and goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
current accounting standards require testing these assets for impairment  either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or annually  based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook 
while we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future  our analyses are subjective and are based on conditions existing at  and trends leading up to  the time the estimates and assumptions are made 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
our judgments with regard to our future business prospects could impact whether or not an impairment is deemed to have occurred  as well as the timing of the recognition of such an impairment charge 
our equity method investees also perform such tests for impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
self insurance reserves 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including general liability  workers compensation  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are estimated by considering various historical trends and forward looking assumptions related to costs  claim counts and payments 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes 
the tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses not deductible on our tax return 
however  some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense  and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities  which could also adversely impact our cash flow 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
under this interpretation  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
derivative instruments 
from time to time  we utilize derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and locks to assist in managing our interest rate risk 
we do not enter into any interest rate swap or lock derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we account for the interest rate swaps and locks in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
contingent liabilities 
our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
in the ordinary course of business we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our company 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if either the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible or an estimate of loss is not determinable 
legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 

table of contents acquisition and divestitures raceway associates on february   we acquired the percent ownership interested in raceway associates  llc raceway associates we did not previously own  bringing our ownership to percent 
raceway associates operates chicagoland speedway chicagoland and route raceway route 
the purchase price for the percent ownership interest totaled approximately million  including approximately million paid to the prior owners  the assumption of third party liabilities and acquisition costs  net of cash received 
the purchase price was paid with cash on hand and approximately million in borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
this transaction has been accounted for as a business combination and is included in our consolidated operations subsequent to the date of acquisition 
we believe that the chicagoland and route acquisitions are well positioned in the nation s third largest media market with a strong motorsports fan base 
the purchase price for the raceway associates acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair market values at the acquisition date 
included in this acquisition are certain indefinite lived intangible assets attributable to the sanction agreements in place at the time of acquisition and goodwill 
nazareth speedway after the completion of nazareth speedway s nazareth fiscal events we suspended indefinitely its major motorsports event operations 
the nascar nationwide series and irl indycar series events  then conducted at nazareth  were realigned to other motorsports entertainment facilities within our portfolio 
the property on which the former nazareth speedway was located continues to be marketed for sale 
for all periods presented  the results of operations of nazareth are presented as discontinued operations 
impairment of long lived assets northwest us speedway development since  we had been pursuing development of a motorsports entertainment facility in kitsap county  washington  which required state legislation to help finance the project 
in early this legislation was introduced in both the washington state house of representatives and senate 
on april   we announced that despite agreeing to substantial changes to the required legislation it had become apparent that additional modifications would be proposed to the bill 
due to the increased risk that the collective modifications would have a significant negative impact on the project s financial model  we felt it was in our best long term interest to discontinue our efforts at the site 
as a result  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge in fiscal of approximately million  or per diluted share  to reflect the write off of certain capitalized costs including legal  consulting  capitalized interest and other project specific costs 
the charge is included in impairment of long lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended november  we still believe the pacific northwest represents an attractive long term opportunity  and remain interested in a motorsports entertainment facility development project in the region 
new york metropolitan speedway development in september we ceased fill operations at our staten island real property while we addressed the issues raised in communications from the new york state department of environmental conservation dec and the new york city department of sanitation dos  including the presence of  and potential need to remediate  fill containing constituents above regulatory thresholds 
in may  we entered into a consent order with the dec to resolve the issues surrounding these fill operations and the prior placement of fill at the site that contained constituents above regulatory thresholds 
the consent order required us to remove non compliant fill pursuant to an approved comprehensive fill removal plan 
we completed fill removal activities in the second quarter of fiscal the consent order also required us to pay a penalty to dec of  half of which was paid in may and the other half of which has been suspended so long as we comply with the terms of the consent order 
included in impairment of long lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations at november  and  is our estimated total costs  including the portion of the penalty which has been paid  attributable to the expected fill removal process of approximately million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
the property is currently marketed for sale and we have received interest from multiple parties 
although we are disappointed that our speedway development efforts were unsuccessful on staten island  we still 
table of contents have an interest in pursuing the development of a motorsports entertainment facility in the region 
due to the considerable interest in and support for nascar racing in the metro new york market  we believe a premier motorsports entertainment facility will have a significant positive impact on the area s economy and prove to be a long term community asset 
equity and other investments motorsports authentics in the fourth quarter of fiscal we partnered with speedway motorsports  inc in a joint venture  smisc  llc smisc  which  through its wholly owned subsidiary motorsports authentics  llc conducts business under the name motorsports authentics 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  motorsports authentics acquired team caliber and action performance  inc  respectively  and became a leader in design  promotion  marketing and distribution of motorsports licensed merchandise 
subsequent to the acquisitions  motorsports authentics made significant progress towards improving the acquired business operations and delivered a profit for fiscal in a challenging economy 
we continue to believe the sale of licensed merchandise represents a significant opportunity in the sport and are optimistic that motorsports authentics has a solid plan for the future 
in fiscal  as a result of certain significant driver and team changes and excess merchandise on hand  motorsports authentics recognized a write down of certain inventory and related assets in the third quarter 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal motorsports authentics completed forward looking strategic financial planning 
the resulting financial projections were utilized in its annual valuation analysis of goodwill  certain intangible assets and other long lived assets which resulted in an impairment charge on such assets 
our percent portion of motorsports authentics fiscal net income is approximately million  or per diluted share and fiscal net loss is approximately million  or per diluted share  which included the aforementioned inventory and related asset write down of approximately million  or per diluted share  and impairment charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  are included in equity in net loss income from equity investments in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended november  and  respectively 
daytona live development in may  we announced we had entered into a joint venture the dljv  with the cordish company cordish  one of the largest and most respected developers in the country  to explore a potential mixed use entertainment destination development on acres 
the development named daytona live is located directly across international speedway boulevard from our daytona motorsports entertainment facility 
the acreage that we currently own includes an existing office building which houses our present corporate headquarters and certain offices of nascar 
preliminary conceptual designs call for a  square foot mixed use retail dining entertainment area as well as a movie theater with up to  seats  a residential component and a room hotel 
the initial development will also include approximately  square feet of office space to house the new headquarters of isc  nascar  grand american and their related businesses  and additional space for other tenants 
construction of the office building is underway and is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of to date  cobb theaters has signed on to anchor daytona live with a  square foot  screen theater 
the theater will feature digital projection with d capabilities  stadium seating and a loge level providing reserved premium seats  and a full service restaurant as well as in seat service for food and beverages 
final design plans for the development of the retail dining entertainment and hotel components are being completed and will incorporate the results of local market studies and further project analysis 
the dljv is hopeful it will receive all necessary permitting and other approvals for the initial development during the current estimated cost for the initial development  which includes the new headquarters office building and the retail dining entertainment  hotel and residential components  is approximately million 
the new headquarters office building was financed in july through a million construction term loan obtained by daytona beach live headquarters building  llc dblhb  a wholly owned subsidiary of the dljv  which was created to own and operate the office building once it is completed 
both isc and cordish anticipate contributing equal amounts to the dljv for the remaining equity necessary for the project 
we expect our contribution to range 
table of contents between million and million  plus land we currently own 
the balance is expected to be funded primarily by private financing obtained by the dljv 
specific financing considerations for the dljv are dependent on several factors  including lease arrangements  availability of project financing and overall market conditions 
lastly  when the new headquarters building is completed we will relocate from our existing office building  which is not fully depreciated and is expected be subsequently razed 
during fiscal we recognized million  or  per diluted share  respectively  of additional depreciation on this existing office building 
during fiscal we recognized approximately million  or per diluted share on this existing office building and certain other offices and buildings which were razed in fiscal we expect to recognize approximately million  or per diluted share  of additional depreciation on the existing office building in fiscal in accordance with the fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  we have determined that dblhb is a variable interest entity for which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
as the primary beneficiary we have consolidated this entity in our financial statements as of november  as discussed above  in july  dblhb entered into a construction term loan agreement to finance the headquarters building 
the construction loan agreement is collateralized by the underlying assets of dblhb  including cash and the real property of the new office building which have a carrying value of approximately million  at november   and are included in the restricted cash  long term restricted cash and investments  and property and equipment amounts included in the consolidated balance sheets and minority interest amount recorded on the consolidated statements of operations 
as master tenant of the building we have entered into a year lease arrangement with dblhb whereby such lease payments are consistent with the terms of the construction term loan funding requirements 
the headquarters building financing is non recourse to us and is secured by the lease between us and dblhb 
in addition  we have evaluated the existing arrangements of dljv and its remaining projects and have determined them to be variable interest entities as of november  we are presently not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these entities and accordingly have accounted for them as equity investments in our financial statements at november  the maximum exposure of loss to us  as a result of our involvement with the dljv  is approximately million at november  we do not expect this determination will change during the course of the development of the project 
kansas hotel and casino development in september  our wholly owned subsidiary kansas speedway development corporation ksdc and the cordish company  with whom we have formed a joint venture kjv  to pursue this project  submitted a joint proposal to the government of wyandotte county kansas city  kansas unified government for the development of a casino  hotel and retail and entertainment project in wyandotte county  on property adjacent to kansas speedway 
the unified government has approved rezoning of approximately acres at kansas speedway to allow development of the proposed project 
in december  the kjv negotiated a memorandum of understanding with hard rock hotel holdings to brand the entertainment destination development as a hard rock hotel casino 
the kansas lottery commission will act as the state s casino owner 
in september  the kansas lottery gaming facility review board awarded the casino management contract for the northeast kansas gaming zone to the kjv 
on december   kjv withdrew its application for lottery gaming facility manager for the northeast kansas gaming zone due to the uncertainty in the global financial markets and the expected inability to debt finance the full project at reasonable rates 
we and cordish anticipated contributing between and percent of the total cost to the kjv 
the remaining portion was expected to be funded by non recourse  secured debt financing obtained by the kjv 
we contributed working capital loans of approximately million to the kjv as of november  as a result of kjv s withdrawal of its application  we received approximately million from the kjv  reflecting our share of the refund of the gaming license deposit 
in addition  we recognized a charge of approximately million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal to provide for the remaining working capital funds previously advanced to the kjv 
the proposal included a million square foot  hard rock hotel casino which was expected to include a room luxury hotel  a state of the art casino with  slot machines and gaming tables   square feet of destination retail  dining and entertainment including a live music venue  first class resort amenities  and extensive meeting and convention facilities 
the initial development was expected to cost approximately million to construct 
included in kjv s proposal was our commitment to petition nascar to realign a second nascar 
table of contents sprint cup series race to kansas speedway by no later than the source of the race  which will come from one of our other facilities  has not been determined 
the proposal anticipated the development to be completed during fiscal however  in the current financing environment we required the flexibility  if needed  to phase in the hotel  convention facilities  and additional entertainment components 
as this was technically not permitted within the existing agreement  and this agreement could not be modified  prior to kjv s million deposit becoming non refundable and the partners becoming obligated to build the entire project  kjv withdrew its application 
at the beginning of  the state of kansas re opened the bidding process for the casino management contract and we look forward to resubmitting an application with a phased approach for the non gaming amenities 
we have evaluated the existing arrangements of the kjv and have determined it to be a variable interest entity at november   in accordance with the fasb interpretation no 
r  however it has been determined that we are not the primary beneficiary and accordingly it has been accounted for as an equity investment in our financial statements at november  our equity investments also include our percent limited partnership investment in stock car montreal lp and our pro rata share of our percent equity investment in raceway associates prior to the acquisition of the remaining interest in february stock purchase plan an important component of our capital allocation strategy is returning capital to shareholders 
we have solid operating margins that generate substantial operating cash flow 
using these internally generated proceeds  we have returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders primarily through our share repurchase program 
in december we implemented a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to purchase up to million of our outstanding class a common shares 
in february we announced that our board of directors had authorized an incremental million share repurchase program 
collectively these programs are described as the stock purchase plans 
the stock purchase plans allow us to purchase up to million of our outstanding class a common shares 
the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the stock purchase plans will depend on a variety of factors  including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  capital availability and other market conditions 
the stock purchase plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
no shares have been or will be knowingly purchased from company insiders or their affiliates 
in september  as a result of our desire to build cash balances due to the challenges facing the credit markets  we suspended purchases under the stock purchase plans 
we have million in senior notes maturing in april see future liquidity 
this past october we drew down on our million credit facility see future liquidity 
if we are not able to secure acceptable terms for a refinancing in early  we will use these borrowings under the credit facility as a bridge to a more favorable credit market and utilize operating cash flow to pay down the balance on the credit facility in the interim 
once we have secured a favorable long term credit financing solution  we expect to resume repurchasing shares under the stock purchase plans 
since inception of the stock purchase plans through november   we have purchased  shares of our class a common shares  for a total of approximately million 
included in these totals are the purchases of  shares of our class a common shares during the fiscal year ended november   at an average cost of approximately per share including commissions  for a total of approximately million 
these transactions occurred in open market purchases and pursuant to a trading plan under rule b at november   we have approximately million remaining repurchase authority under the current stock purchase plans 

table of contents accounting adjustment during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  to correct the carrying value amount of certain other assets 
this adjustment was recorded in interest income and other in the consolidated statement of operations 
we believe the adjustment is not material to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended november   and in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  we considered qualitative and quantitative factors  including the income from continuing operations we reported in each of the prior years and for the current year  the non cash nature of the adjustment and our substantial shareholders equity at the end of each of the prior years 
income taxes the tax treatment related to the uncertainties associated with the losses incurred by our equity investee smisc  is the principal cause of the increased effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended november  current litigation from time to time  we are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not believe that the resolution of any or all of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to such routine litigation incident to our business  we are a party to the litigation described below 
in july  kentucky speedway  llc filed a civil action in the eastern district of kentucky against nascar and us which alleged that nascar and isc have acted  and continue to act  individually and in combination and collusion with each other and other companies that control motorsports entertainment facilities hosting nascar nextel cup series  to illegally restrict the award of 
nascar nextel cup series 
races 
the complaint was amended in to seek  in addition to damages  an injunction requiring nascar to develop objective factors for the award of nextel cup races  divestiture of isc and nascar so that the france family and anyone else does not share ownership of both companies or serve as officers or directors of both companies  isc s divestiture of at least of its racetracks that currently operate a nextel cup race and prohibiting further alleged violations of the antitrust laws 
the complaint did not ask the court to cause nascar to award a nextel cup race to the kentucky speedway 
other than some vaguely conclusory allegations  the complaint failed to specify any specific unlawful conduct by us 
pre trial discovery in the case was concluded and based upon all of the factual and expert evidentiary materials adduced we were more firmly convinced than ever that the case was without legal or factual merit 
on january  our position was vindicated when the federal district court judge hearing the case ruled in favor of isc and nascar and entered a judgment which stated it is ordered and adjudged that all claims of the plaintiff  kentucky speedway  llc  be  and they are  hereby dismissed  with prejudice  at the cost of the plaintiff 
the opinion and order of the courted entered on the same day concluded after careful consideration and a thorough review of the record  and granting 
kentucky 
speedway the benefit of the doubt on all reasonable inferences therefrom  the court concludes that 
kentucky 
speedway has failed to make out its case 
subsequently  on january  kentucky speedway  llc filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeal for the sixth circuit 
the appellate briefing process has been completed and we are awaiting notification from the appellate court about the scheduling of oral argument 
we expect the appellate process to be resolved in our favor in approximately to months 
at this point the likelihood of a materially adverse result appears to be remote  although there is always an element of uncertainty in litigation 
it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential magnitude of such a remote possible adverse decision 
the fees and expenses associated with the defense of this suit have not been covered by insurance and have adversely impacted our financial condition 
since the judgment entered by the court allows us to seek recovery of our costs not including attorney fees from the kentucky speedway  we are preparing materials to submit to the court to have the amount of our allowable costs determined and intend to pursue recovery from the kentucky speedway of the maximum amounts allowed by the court  which should include those costs necessarily incurred in successfully 
table of contents defending the appeal to the sixth circuit 
future trends in operating results economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates  may impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence  the rise in unemployment and increased fuel and food costs  significantly contributed to the decrease in attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal we currently expect substantially all of these trends to continue into  which will adversely impact event attendance related revenues 
an important component of our operating strategy has been our long standing practice of focusing closely on supply and demand when evaluating ticket pricing and adding incremental capacity at our facilities 
by effectively managing ticket prices and seating capacity  we can stimulate ticket renewals and advance sales 
advance ticket sales result in earlier cash flow and reduce the potential negative impact of actual and forecasted inclement weather on ticket sales 
with any ticketing program  we first examine our pricing structure to ensure that prices are inline with market demand 
typically  we raise prices on select areas of our facilities during any one year 
when necessary  we will reduce pricing on inventory 
we are sensitive to the economic challenges that many of our fans face  and to address this  beginning in we are lowering prices on over  seats  or percent of our grandstand capacity  for nascar sprint cup events across the company 
in addition  we have created ticket packages that provide added value opportunities  making it more affordable for our fans to attend live events 
these packages may include an all you can eat component  fuel saving offers  military discounts  and  we have added general admission only grandstands where in many cases  children s admissions are free 
we are also continuing to provide a number of expanded installment payment programs 
while we will adjust pricing outside of the sales cycle as needed as well as join with sponsors to offer promotions to generate additional ticket sales  we avoid rewarding last minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets 
we believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long term growth than to capture short term incremental revenue 
with regard to corporate marketing partner relationships  we believe that our presence in key markets  impressive portfolio of events and attractive fan demographics are beneficial and help to mitigate adverse economic trends as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing marketing partnerships and establish new corporate relationships 
for example  fiscal was the first year of our multi year  multi facility official status agreement with coca cola  which ranks as one of the most significant official status marketing partnerships in our history 
in addition  we benefited from our first multi year facility naming rights agreement between auto club of southern california and our california facility that began in as the economic outlook further deteriorated in the latter part of fiscal  however  we began to see a slow down in corporate spending for hospitality 
in addition  the process of securing sponsorship deals became more time consuming as corporations are more closely scrutinizing their marketing budgets 
we expect these trends to continue into  which will negatively impact year over year comparability 
despite current economic conditions  we continue to bring not only new sponsors into the sport but are also able to create new official status categories 
for example  we recently announced a five year  multi track partnership with servicemaster 
in addition  nextera energy resources  the nation s largest provider of wind and solar energy  became an official status partner of daytona international speedway daytona and homestead miami speedway homestead  as well as took major race entitlement positions with both florida based speedways 
we continue to believe that revenues from our corporate marketing relationships will grow over the long term  contributing to strong earnings and cash flow stability and predictability 
domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees revenues are an important component to our revenue and earnings stream 
starting in  nascar entered into new combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed for the domestic broadcast and related rights for its three national touring series sprint cup  nationwide and craftsman truck 
the agreements total approximately billion over the eight year period from through this results in an approximate million gross average annual rights fee for the industry  a more than percent increase over the previous contract average of million annually 
the industry rights 
table of contents fees were approximately million for  and will increase  on average  by approximately three percent per year through the season 
the annual increase is expected to vary between two and four percent per year over the period 
while the industry rights fees were less than the industry rights fees of approximately million  in our opinion this should not overshadow the strategic importance and expected long term benefits of the new contracts 
nascar viewership for all three of its national touring series grew in  with nascar sprint cup events consistently the highest rated televised professional sporting events on any given weekend  second only to the national football league 
in addition  nascar nationwide races are the second most watched form of motorsports entertainment in the country 
over the past several years  there has been a shift of major sports programming from network to cable 
the cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to networks  which has resulted in increased rights fees for these sports properties 
cable  however  reaches far fewer households than network broadcasts 
we view nascar s decision to keep approximately two thirds of its nascar sprint cup series event schedule on network television as important to the sport s future growth 
the structure should continue to drive increased fan and media awareness for all three racing series  which will help fuel our long term attendance and corporate related revenues 
we also welcomed the re establishment of the sport s broadcast relationship with espn  which we believe results in further exposure for nascar racing 
we believe the nascar nationwide series has and will continue to significantly benefit from the improved continuity of its season long presence on espn 
in addition  we believe the sport as a whole benefits from the increased ancillary programming and nightly and weekly nascar branded programming and promotions  similar to what espn does with the other major sports 
the most significant benefit of the new contracts is the substantial increase in earnings and cash flow visibility for the entire industry over the contract period 
television broadcast and ancillary rights fees from continuing operations received from nascar for the nascar sprint cup  nationwide and craftsman truck races conducted at our wholly owned facilities under these agreements  and recorded as part of motorsports related revenue  were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
operating income generated by these media rights were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
as media rights revenues fluctuate so do the variable costs tied to the percentage of broadcast rights fees required to be paid to competitors as part of nascar sprint cup  nationwide and craftsman truck series sanction agreements 
nascar prize and point fund monies  as well as sanction fees nascar direct expenses  are outlined in the sanction agreement for each event and are negotiated in advance of an event 
as previously discussed  included in these nascar direct expenses are percent of the gross domestic television broadcast rights fees allocated to our nascar sprint cup  nationwide and craftsman truck series events  as part of prize and point fund money 
these annually negotiated contractual amounts paid to nascar contribute to the support and growth of the sport of nascar stock car racing through payments to the teams and sanction fees paid to nascar 
as such  we do not expect these costs to decrease in the future as a percentage of admissions and motorsports related income 
we anticipate any operating margin improvement to come primarily from economies of scale and controlling costs in areas such as motorsports related and general and administrative expenses 
our success has been  and is expected to remain  dependent on maintaining good working relationships with the organizations that sanction events at our facilities  particularly with nascar  whose sanctioned events at our wholly owned facilities accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal nascar continues to entertain and discuss proposals from track operators regarding potential realignment of nascar sprint cup series dates to more geographically diverse and potentially more desirable markets where there may be greater demand  resulting in an opportunity for increased revenues to the track operators 
nascar approved realignments of certain nascar sprint cup and other events at our facilities for the through seasons 
we believe that the realignments have provided  and will continue to provide  incremental net positive revenue and earnings as well as further enhance the sport s exposure in highly desirable markets  which we believe benefits the sport s fans  teams  sponsors and television broadcast partners as well as promoters 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these future opportunities 
one example is our proposed hotel and casino project at kansas speedway see kansas hotel and casino development 
nascar has indicated that it is open to discussion regarding additional date realignments  and  assuming our proposal is awarded the casino management contract by the state of kansas as part of the current re bidding process  we plan to petition nascar for additional date realignments for the speedway 

table of contents since we compete with newer entertainment venues for patrons and sponsors  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance our facilities  thereby producing additional revenue opportunities and improving the event experience for our guests 
major examples of these efforts include fiscal renovations and expansions at the auto club speedway of southern california auto club speedway formerly the california speedway  where we renovated and expanded the facility s front midway area 
the new plaza features a full service outdoor caf with cuisine by celebrity chef wolfgang puck  in addition to a town center  retail store and concert stage 
other highlights include shade features  modified entry gates  expanded hospitality areas  radio broadcast locations  giant video walls  leisure areas and grass and water accents 
this project was the direct result of fan feedback  and further demonstrates our commitment to providing a premium entertainment environment for our guests 
in fiscal  we are adding escalators to improve traffic flow to suites and tower seats as well as adding other fan amenities  we replaced approximately  grandstand seats behind turns three and four at phoenix international raceway phoenix with upgraded grandstands and luxury suites behind turn one which provided improved sightlines and a more premium seating and suite experience for our fans 
we also added a person premier club called octane atop the turn one grandstands  which provided guests with an elite setting to experience racing in style  and we repaved talladega superspeedway s talladega mile oval 
talladega s racing surface had not been repaved since  and we believe the newly paved racing surface has enhanced the thrilling on track competition 
fiscal in connection with the construction of the three tiered grandstand at richmond international raceway richmond  we completed a person  members only torque club for individual fans looking to enjoy a race weekend in style or businesses seeking to entertain clients 
the torque club also serves as a unique site for special events on non race weekends throughout the year 
escalators to improve traffic flow to the new torque club and grandstand were added in fiscal fiscal we installed track lighting at chicagoland as well as improved certain electrical infrastructure in certain camping areas 
in addition to enhancing the guest experience  we now have the flexibility to run events later in the day in the event of inclement weather  we repaved darlington raceway darlington and constructed a tunnel in turn that provides improved access for fans and allows emergency vehicles to easily enter and exit the infield area of the track 
these collective projects mark the largest one time investment in the year history of the storied south carolina facility  we enhanced seating at michigan international speedway michigan to provide wider seats  seatbacks and more leg room for fans 
we also added incremental camping capacity and new shower restroom facilities for our on site overnight guests  as well as installed a state of the art foot  three sided led scoreboard for fans to more easily follow the on track competition 
finally  we added additional branded way finding signage to help pedestrians  motorists and campers find their way in  out and around the  acre racetrack property  and we constructed new media centers at watkins glen international watkins glen and homestead  which we believe increased appeal to media content providers  sports journalists  racing team owners and drivers and others involved in the motorsports industry 

table of contents our growth strategies also include exploring ways to grow our businesses through acquisitions  developments and joint ventures 
this has most recently been demonstrated through the acquisitions of the additional interests in raceway associates  owner and operator of chicagoland and route  our motorsports authentics joint venture see previous discussion of equity and other investments and our planned real estate development joint ventures with the cordish company see daytona live development and kansas hotel and casino development 
postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events the postponement or cancellation of one or more major motorsports events could adversely impact our future operating results 
a postponement or cancellation could be caused by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  inclement weather  a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis  a general postponement or cancellation of all major sporting events in this country as occurred following the september  terrorist attacks  a terrorist attack at any mass gathering or fear of such an attack  conditions resulting from the wars in iraq and afghanistan or other acts or prospects of war

table of contents comparison of fiscal to fiscal the comparison of fiscal to fiscal is impacted by the following factors economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates  impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence  the rise in unemployment and increased fuel and food costs  significantly contributed to the decrease in attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal  during fiscal  approximately million  or per diluted share  of depreciation was accelerated above our normal depreciation rates relating to our existing office building in daytona beach  florida which is expected to be razed subsequent to us moving in to our new headquarters office building as part of our daytona live project see further discussion in future liquidity 
during fiscal  depreciation was accelerated above our normal depreciation rates relating to this existing office building and certain other offices and buildings which were razed in fiscal as part of our daytona live project totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and  we recognized impairments of long lived assets totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively  primarily attributable to costs associated with the fill removal process at our staten island property and impairments of certain other long lived assets 
the fiscal impairments also included the aforementioned discontinuance of the speedway development in kitsap county  washington  during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  to correct the carrying value amount of certain other assets 
this adjustment was recorded in interest income and other in the consolidated statement of operations 
we believe the adjustment is not material to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended november   and  and in fiscal  equity in net loss from equity investments includes the previously discussed charge of approximately million  or per diluted share  as a result of kjv s withdrawal of its application for its casino management contract and income of approximately million  or per diluted share  representing our portion of the results from our percent indirect interest in motorsports authentics

see discussion under future trends in operating results 
admissions revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the decreases in attendance due to previously discussed adverse economic trends  for events and to a lesser extent  the impact of inclement weather at certain spring events conducted at auto club speedway 
these decreases are partially offset by the increase in attendance for certain events conducted during speedweeks at daytona supporting the th running of the sold out daytona and  to a lesser extent  the increase in attendance at certain events at chicagoland 
the overall decrease in attendance was also partially offset by a slight increase in the weighted average ticket price of tickets sold for the majority of our events 
motorsports related revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in suite and hospitality revenue  track rentals  motorsports publishing services  and advertising for comparable events 
this decrease is partially offset by an increase in the television broadcast and ancillary rights for our nascar sprint cup  nationwide  and craftsman truck series 
food  beverage and merchandise revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to previously discussed adverse economic conditions affecting attendance and inclement weather for the above mentioned event 
the decrease was partially offset by the increased merchandise and concession sales for certain events conducted during speedweeks at daytona supporting the th running of the sold out daytona prize and point fund monies and nascar sanction fees increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily related to the increase in television broadcast rights fees for the nascar sprint cup  nationwide and craftsman truck series events as standard nascar sanctioning 
table of contents agreements require that a specific percentage of television broadcast rights fees be paid to competitors and  to a lesser extent  increased nascar sanction fees 
motorsports related expense increased by approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to promotional and advertising expenses for certain events conducted during the period including the th running of the sold out daytona the increase was partially offset by costs associated with the irl series weekend at michigan in fiscal that did not occur in fiscal motorsports related expense as a percentage of combined admissions and motorsports related revenue increased to percent  as compared to percent for the same respective period in the prior year 
the margin decrease is primarily due to the previously discussed increased promotional and advertising expenses  combined with the previously discussed revenue decreases 
food  beverage and merchandise expense decreased approximately  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to lower variable costs associated with lower sales related to the previously discussed decreases in attendance 
substantially offsetting this decrease were increased variable costs associated with the increased sales attributable to the previously discussed increase in attendance for certain events conducted during speedweeks at daytona supporting the th running of the sold out daytona food  beverage and merchandise expense as a percentage of food  beverage and merchandise revenue increased to approximately percent in fiscal  as compared to percent for fiscal the margin decrease is primarily due to reduced catering and the sale of lower margin merchandise and concessions 
general and administrative expense decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in legal fees  certain operating costs related to the pursuit of development projects  an adjustment to certain other property taxes in addition to certain cost containment initiatives 
the decrease is partially offset by twelve months of expenses relating to chicagoland and route in fiscal as compared to only ten months of such expenses in the same period of the prior year subsequent to the february  acquisition 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to approximately percent for fiscal  as compared to percent for fiscal the change is primarily due to the previously discussed reduction in general and administrative expenses partially offset by the previously discussed revenue decreases 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease substantially consists of the reduction of the previously discussed accelerated depreciation on certain office and other buildings 
the decrease is partially offset by depreciation expense associated with twelve months of depreciation relating to chicagoland and route in fiscal as compared to only ten months in the same period of the prior year subsequent to the february  acquisition  as well as other ongoing capital improvements 
interest income and other decreased by approximately million  or percent  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the previously discussed non cash charge of million  or per diluted share  to correct the carrying value of certain other assets 
lower cash and short term investment balances driven by use of cash for our previously discussed stock purchase plans impacted the period as well 
interest expense increased by approximately  or percent  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to the interest expense related to our new headquarters building and interest on borrowings related to our revolving credit facility see discussion under liquidity and capital resources general 
the increase is substantially offset by higher capitalized interest and lower average borrowings on our credit facility in the current periods 
equity in net loss from equity investments improved significantly in the current fiscal period as compared to the same respective period of the prior year primarily due to the operations of motorsports authentics see equity and other investments 
our pro rata share of the loss from our percent equity investment in raceway associates prior to the acquisition of the remaining interest in february also contributed to the improvement in the current year 
partially offsetting the above items was the previously discussed charge relating to the kjv 
our effective income tax rate decreased from approximately percent to percent during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the tax treatment associated with losses incurred in fiscal and income earned in fiscal by motorsports authentics as well as certain 
table of contents restructuring initiatives in fiscal and certain state tax implications relating to the impairment of long lived assets recognized in fiscal the decrease was partially offset by the tax exempt nature of the aforementioned non cash charge to interest income and other during the first quarter of fiscal the operations of nazareth are presented as discontinued operations  net of tax  for all periods presented in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased approximately million  or per diluted share  for fiscal as compared to fiscal also contributing to the increase in the earnings per diluted share is the reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the previously discussed stock repurchase program

liquidity and capital resources general we have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures at existing facilities  payments of an annual cash dividend and more recently  to repurchase our shares under our stock purchase plan 
in addition  we have used the proceeds from offerings of our class a common stock  the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  borrowings under our credit facilities and state and local mechanisms to fund acquisitions and development projects

see future liquidity for additional disclosures relating to our credit facility and certain risks that may affect our near term operating results and liquidity 
as it relates to capital allocation  our top priority is fan and competitor safety  as well as regulatory compliance

we also estimate the cost to complete our new headquarters building at november  is approximately million 
as a result of these currently approved projects and estimated additional approvals in fiscal  we expect our total fiscal capital expenditures at our existing facilities will be approximately million  depending on the timing of certain projects 
we review the capital expenditure program periodically and modify it as required to meet current business needs 
future liquidity general as discussed in future trends in operating results  economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates  may impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence  the rise in unemployment and increased fuel and food costs  significantly contributed to the decrease in attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal we currently expect substantially all of these trends to continue into  which will negatively impact year over year comparability for most all of our revenue categories with the exception of domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees 
our cash flow from operations consists primarily of ticket  hospitality  merchandise  catering and concession sales and contracted revenues arising from television broadcast rights and marketing partnerships 
despite current economic conditions  we believe that cash flows from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents  short

accordingly  in october  as a result of our desire to build cash balances due to the challenges facing the credit markets  we drew down on our million credit facility see below in future liquidity the million necessary to fund the million in senior notes maturing in april see below in future liquidity 
if we are not able to secure acceptable terms for a refinancing in early  we will use these borrowings under the credit facility as a bridge to a more favorable credit market and utilize operating cash flow to pay down the balance on the credit facility in the interim 
we remain interested in pursuing further development and or acquisition opportunities including the possible development of new motorsports entertainment facilities  such as the new york metropolitan area  the northwest us  denver and other areas  the timing  size and success  as well as associated potential capital commitments  of which are unknown at this time 
accordingly  a material acceleration of our growth strategy could require us to obtain additional capital through debt and or equity financings 
although there can be no assurance  over the longer term we believe that adequate debt and equity financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
while we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future  our financial results depend significantly on a number of factors 
in addition to economic conditions  consumer and corporate spending could be adversely affected by security and other lifestyle conditions resulting in lower than expected future operating cash flows 
general economic conditions were significantly and negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks and the wars in iraq and afghanistan and could be similarly affected by any future attacks or fear of such attacks  or by conditions resulting from other acts or prospects of war 
any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance  security or other related matters 
also  our financial results could be adversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis 
the items discussed above could have a singular or compounded material adverse affect on our financial success and future cash flow 
long term obligations and commitments on april   we completed an offering of million principal amount of unsecured senior notes in a private placement 
on september   we completed an offer to exchange the senior notes for registered senior notes with substantially identical terms senior notes

the senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part  at our option  at any time or from time to time at redemption prices as defined in the indenture 
our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of the senior notes 
in june we entered into an interest rate lock agreement to effectively lock in a substantial portion of the interest rate exposure on approximately million notional amount in anticipation of refinancing the million percent senior notes that mature in april this interest rate lock was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this agreement  with a principal notional amount of million and an estimated fair value of a liability totaling million at november   expires in february the estimated fair value is based on relevant market information and quoted market prices at november  and is recognized in other comprehensive loss in the consolidated financial statements 
if we are not able to secure acceptable terms for a refinancing of the percent senior notes in early we expect to extend the current interest rate lock prior to its termination for a period to be determined  based on management s best estimate for when the debt refinancing will occur  and will

the credit facility contains a feature that allows us to increase the credit facility to a total of million  subject to certain 
table of contents conditions

the contractual cash obligations table above excludes the long term liability for these uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
commercial commitment expirations are as follows as of november  in thousands commitment expiration by period less than after total one year years years years guarantees unused credit facilities total commercial commitments stock purchase plan in december we implemented a share repurchase program stock purchase plan under which we are authorized to purchase up to million of our outstanding class a common shares 
in february we announced that our board of directors had authorized an incremental million share repurchase program 
collectively these programs are described as the stock purchase plans 
the stock purchase plans allow us to purchase up to million of our outstanding class a common shares 
the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the stock purchase plans will depend on a variety of factors  including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  capital availability and other market conditions 
the stock purchase plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
no shares have been or will be knowingly purchased from company insiders or their affiliates 
since inception of the stock purchase plans through november   we have purchased  shares of our class a common shares  for a total of approximately million 
included in these totals are the purchases of  shares of our class a common shares during the fiscal year ended november   at an average cost of approximately per share including commissions  for a total of approximately million 
these transactions occurred in open market purchases and pursuant to a trading plan under rule b at november   we have approximately million remaining repurchase authority under the current stock purchase plans 
speedway developments in light of nascar s publicly announced position regarding additional potential realignment of the nascar 
table of contents sprint cup series schedule  we also believe there are still potential development opportunities in other new  underserved markets across the country 
as such  we have been and are exploring opportunities for public private partnerships targeted to develop one or more motorsports entertainment facilities in new markets  including denver  colorado  the northwest us and the new york metropolitan area 
daytona live development in may  we announced we had entered into a joint venture  dljv  with cordish  one of the largest and most respected developers in the country  to explore a potential mixed use entertainment destination development on acres 
the development named daytona live is located directly across international speedway boulevard from our daytona motorsports entertainment facility 
the acreage that we currently own includes an existing office building which houses our present corporate headquarters and certain offices of nascar 
preliminary conceptual designs call for a  square foot mixed use retail dining entertainment area as well as a movie theater with up to  seats  a residential component and a room hotel 
the initial development will also include approximately  square feet of office space to house the new headquarters of isc  nascar  grand american and their related businesses  and additional space for other tenants 
construction of the office building is underway and is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of to date  cobb theaters has signed on to anchor daytona live with a  square foot  screen theater 
the theater will feature digital projection with d capabilities  stadium seating and a loge level providing reserved premium seats  and a full service restaurant as well as in seat service for food and beverages 
final design plans for the development of the retail dining entertainment and hotel components are being completed and will incorporate the results of local market studies and further project analysis 
the dljv is hopeful it will receive all necessary permitting and other approvals for the initial development during the current estimated cost for the initial development  which includes the new headquarters office building  the retail dining entertainment  hotel and residential components  is approximately million 
both isc and cordish anticipate contributing equal amounts to the dljv for the remaining equity necessary for the project 
we expect our contribution to range between million and million  plus land we currently own 
the balance is expected to be funded primarily by private financing obtained by the dljv 
specific financing considerations for the dljv are dependent on several factors  including lease arrangements  availability of project financing and overall market conditions 
lastly  when the new headquarters building is completed we will relocate from our existing office building  which is not fully depreciated and is expected be subsequently razed 
kansas hotel and casino development in september  our wholly owned subsidiary ksdc and the cordish company  with whom we have formed kjv to pursue this project  submitted a joint proposal to the unified government for the development of a casino  hotel and retail and entertainment project in wyandotte county  on property adjacent to kansas speedway 
the unified government has approved rezoning of approximately acres at kansas speedway to allow development of the proposed project 
in december  the kjv negotiated a memorandum of understanding with hard rock hotel holdings to brand the entertainment destination development as a hard rock hotel casino 
the kansas lottery commission will act as the state s casino owner 
in september  the kansas lottery gaming facility review board awarded the casino management contract for the northeast kansas gaming zone to the kjv 
on december   kjv withdrew its application for lottery gaming facility manager for the northeast kansas gaming zone due to the uncertainty in the global financial markets and the expected inability to debt finance the full project at reasonable rates 
we and cordish anticipated contributing between and percent of the total cost to the kjv 
the remaining portion was expected to be funded by non recourse  secured debt financing obtained by the kjv 
the proposal included a million square foot  hard rock hotel casino which was expected to include a room luxury hotel  a state of the art casino with  slot machines and gaming tables   square feet of destination retail  dining and entertainment including a live music venue  first class resort amenities  and extensive meeting and convention facilities 
the initial development was expected to cost approximately million to construct 
included in kjv s proposal was our commitment to petition nascar to realign a second nascar 
table of contents sprint cup series race to kansas speedway by no later than the source of the race  which will come from one of our other facilities  has not been determined 
the proposal anticipated the development to be completed during fiscal however  in the current financing environment we required the flexibility  if needed  to phase in the hotel  convention facilities  and additional entertainment components 
as this was technically not permitted within the existing agreement  and this agreement could not be modified  prior to kjv s million deposit becoming non refundable and the partners becoming obligated to build the entire project  kjv withdrew its application 
at the beginning of  the state of kansas re opened the bidding process for the casino management contract and we look forward to resubmitting an application with a phased approach for the non gaming amenities 
internal revenue service examination the internal revenue service the service is currently performing a periodic examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended november  through and has challenged the tax depreciation treatment of a significant portion of our motorsports entertainment facility assets 
in order to prevent incurring additional interest related to years through fiscal  we have approximately million on deposit with the service as of november   which is classified as long term assets in our consolidated financial statements 
our deposits are not a payment of tax  and we will receive accrued interest on any of these funds ultimately returned to us 
in june the service commenced the administrative appeals process which is currently expected to take and additional three to twelve months to complete 
if our appeal is not resolved satisfactorily  we will evaluate all of our options  including litigation 
we believe that our application of the federal income tax regulations in question  which have been applied consistently since their enactment and have been subjected to previous irs audits  is appropriate  and we intend to vigorously defend the merits of our position 
while an adverse resolution of these matters could result in a material negative impact on cash flow  including payment of taxes from amounts currently on deposit with the service  we believe that we have provided adequate reserves related to these matters including interest charges through november   and  as a result  do not expect that such an outcome would have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating costs and earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates in the normal course of business 
our interest income 
table of contents and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates and the libor rate 
in order to manage this exposure  from time to time we use a combination of debt instruments  including the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swap and lock agreements 
we do not enter into any derivatives for trading purposes 
the objective of our asset management activities is to provide an adequate level of interest income and liquidity to fund operations and capital expansion  while minimizing market risk 
we utilize overnight sweep accounts and short term investments to minimize the interest rate risk 
we do not believe that our interest rate risk related to our cash equivalents and short term investments is material due to the nature of the investments 
our objective in managing our interest rate risk on our debt is to negotiate the most favorable interest rate structures that we can and  as market conditions evolve  adjust our balance of fixed and variable rate debt to optimize our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps and locks are used from time to time to convert a portion of our debt portfolio from a variable rate to a fixed rate or from a fixed rate to a variable rate as well as to lock in certain rates for future debt issuances 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have various debt instruments that are issued at fixed rates 
these financial instruments  which have a fixed rate of interest  are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the fair values of long term debt are based on quoted market prices at the date of measurement 
our credit facilities approximate fair value as they bear interest rates that approximate market 
at november   we had approximately million of variable debt outstanding  therefore  a hypothetical increase in interest rates by percent would result in an increase in our annual interest expense of approximately million 
at november   the fair value of our total long term debt as determined by quotes from financial institutions was approximately million 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent shift in interest rates would be approximately million at november  from time to time we utilize derivative investments in the form of interest rate swaps and locks to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps and locks match the terms of the debt they are intended to modify 
in june we entered into an interest rate lock agreement to effectively lock in a substantial portion of the interest rate on approximately million notional amount in anticipation of refinancing the million percent senior notes that mature in april this agreement  with a principal notional amount of million and an estimated fair value of a liability totaling million at november   expires in february the estimated fair value is based on relevant market information and quoted market prices at november  and changes in assumptions or market conditions could significantly affect fair value estimates 
credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts on a net basis 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default
