item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with part i of this form k as well as our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the following analysis contains forward looking statements about our future revenues  operating results and expectations 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the risks  assumptions and uncertainties affecting these statements as well as part i  item a risk factors 
overview fiscal year was a milestone year for us as we were released to execute two of our domestic epc ap nuclear power projects and received a partial release on our third domestic epc ap nuclear power project 
additionally  work continued to progress well in china on the first four ap nuclear reactors to ever be constructed 
our financial results were mixed as we generated record revenues  record operating cash flow  record new awards  cash and a substantially increased backlog of unfilled orders 
earnings 
table of contents were strong across the majority of our segments 
however  we experienced cost overruns on two coal fired power plant projects in our fossil  renewables nuclear segment and experienced significant non operating and non cash foreign exchange translation losses in our investment in westinghouse segment that substantially decreased our reported earnings 
finally  the global economic slowdown negatively impacted the number and value of new awards received by our e c and f m segments that may adversely affect the comparative financial results for those businesses in the first half of fiscal year our e i segment generated strong revenue and earnings  primarily driven by increased volume in our federal sector and improved execution 
construction activity on a hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana and our mox project for the doe in south carolina continue to drive e i s earnings 
us government spending remained strong during and the e i segment is well positioned to benefit from an expected increase in government spending in under the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
our f m segment had record revenues in fiscal year  primarily driven by the execution of several large projects already in our backlog  as well as sales from our fabrication facility in mexico which commenced operations during the latter part of fiscal year while earnings were strong in our f m segment  we believe the global economic slowdown resulted in increased market pricing pressure and reduced our profit margins 
our bookings of new orders excluding the transfer of nuclear scope from our fossil  renewables nuclear segment declined throughout the year  as many of our clients delayed capital commitments 
the decline in new orders is likely to result in comparatively reduced revenues and profits during the first half of fiscal year finally  progress continued on our new state of the art module facility that we are constructing in lake charles  louisiana 
our e c segment had record revenues and earnings in fiscal year resulting from strong operational execution on several high margin engineering services contracts executed from their backlog of unfilled orders 
however  as with our f m segment  global economic conditions and the decline in the value of crude oil contributed to a decline in new awards during  and this decline is likely to result in comparatively reduced revenues and profits during the first half of fiscal year our maintenance segment had comparatively reduced revenues and profits in fiscal year as clients delayed major capital commitments as a result of global economic conditions 
the year over year comparative results were adversely impacted as we completed a large capital construction project in fiscal year  which generated margins greater than the routine maintenance services which dominated the financial results 
our fossil  renewables nuclear segment s financial results reflect the continued execution of a number of epc projects for new coal and gas fired power plants  a number of projects targeting emission reductions at existing coal fired power plants  and a services contract for four new ap reactors in china 
we experienced increased field construction labor costs during on two coal fired power plant projects which contributed to lower than expected earnings for this segment 
during fiscal year  we received notices to proceed with two of our domestic epc ap nuclear power projects and a partial release on our third domestic epc ap nuclear power project 
all three projects received state public service commission approval during fiscal year additionally  one of these projects received an early site permit from the nrc 
our consolidated financial results continue to be negatively impacted by significant non operating foreign exchange translation losses resulting from an appreciation of the jpy against the us dollar and from certain non cash expenses resulting from the toshiba event  as more fully described in item we recorded pre tax charges of million and million related to foreign currency translation losses on our jpy denominated bonds for fiscal years and  respectively 
the exchange rate of the jpy to the us dollar at august  was as compared to as of august  as a result of the toshiba event  we reclassified our investment in westinghouse and the corresponding outstanding bonds from long term to current during the third quarter of fiscal year due to the toshiba event  we were required to expense the unamortized original issuance bond discount of million pre tax  or million after tax  as well as the remaining deferred financing costs of million pre tax  or 
table of contents million after tax  during the third quarter of fiscal year these non cash charges are included as interest expense in the financial statements 
see investment in westinghouse segment for additional details regarding the toshiba event 
during our fiscal year  we entered into amendment no 
to our facility to  among other things  extend the maturity from april  to april   and pursuant to such amendment  existing lenders with commitments totaling million agreed to the one year extension 
subsequent to the close of our fiscal year  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement restated credit agreement which provides new and extended lender commitments of  million  all of which is available for the issuance of performance and financial letters of credit and or borrowings for working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
specifically  the restated credit agreement makes available  million through april    million from april  to april  and  million from april  through october  see note debt and revolving lines of credit to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f and liquidity and capital resources below for additional information regarding our facility 
we generated record consolidated operating cash flow during fiscal year driven by all operating segments other than corporate and investment in westinghouse 
cash flow was generated from a combination of operating earnings and favorable changes in working capital 
consolidated results of operations consolidated revenues for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated revenues increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to an increase in revenues in our e i segment  primarily attributable to a hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana 
also contributing to the increase in revenues were higher volumes in our f m and e c segments 
included in e c revenues are client furnished materials for which we recognize no gross profit or loss million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year 
consolidated gross profit for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated gross profit increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to performance in our e c and e i segments 
e c s gross profit increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to an increase in volume of high margin engineering services projects  and e i s increase is primarily related to increased construction activity on a hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana 
additionally  both segments benefitted from an overall improvement in execution 

table of contents consolidated general administrative expenses g a for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated g a increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in order to support our increasing business activity levels in most areas of the company 
specific areas that contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal year include higher business development expenses in our e c segment and the overall expansion of our nuclear business 
consolidated interest expense for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated interest expense increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased interest expense associated with the jpy denominated bonds 
the fiscal year amount includes the expensing of the original issuance bond discount of million pre tax and the remaining deferred financing cost of million pre tax due to the occurrence of a toshiba event 
consolidated income taxes for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal year was as compared to for fiscal year the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the mix of earnings between our domestic and foreign operations  the reduction in certain valuation allowances in fiscal year and an increased provision for uncertain tax positions in fiscal year consolidated earnings losses from unconsolidated entities for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period nm nm not meaningful 
earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a million net of tax reduction in earnings related to our westinghouse equity 

table of contents consolidated net income loss for the year ended august  dollars in millions amount change from prior period change from prior period nm nm not meaningful 
consolidated net income decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to changes in estimated costs to complete two coal fired power plant projects in our fossil  renewables nuclear segment  as well as increased non cash foreign currency translation losses in our investment in westinghouse segment  as the jpy continued to appreciate against the us dollar throughout fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by higher earnings in our e i and e c segments in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year segment results of operations the comments and tables that follow compare revenues  gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment and a discussion of other items  including g a  interest expense and income  income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and income taxes at the consolidated level for the fiscal years ended august   and

reduced demand for electricity in the us and the decline in the stock prices for electric utilities during likely adversely impacted electric utilities investment decisions during however  the segment s epc work on three contracts for six new ap nuclear power reactors in the us were either fully or partially released in while work continued on our services contract for four new ap nuclear power reactors in china 
the domestic nuclear epc contracts significantly increased this segment s backlog of unfilled orders while new awards for air quality control system contracts and new build coal projects significantly declined 
one new build coal petroleum coke fired generation facility was canceled and removed from backlog in the second quarter of fiscal year notwithstanding these changes to the power generation markets  the results for this segment were driven by epc projects for new coal fired  gas and nuclear power plants in the us as well as from air emission reduction projects at existing power plants 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year primarily due to the completion or near completion of several air quality control system projects in the us however  this decrease is partially offset by increased volume on new coal and gas construction projects  as well as the initial work on the three new nuclear construction projects in the us gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year 
table of contents these decreases were primarily due to significantly increased estimated costs to complete two coal fired power plant projects  one of which amounted to million that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year additionally  the decline in the volume of air quality control system projects in fiscal year versus fiscal year contributed to the comparative decline in annual gross profit 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes  minority interest  and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above  as well as an increase in general and administrative expenses as our domestic nuclear work continues to advance 
e i segment the financial results of our e i segment significantly improved during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  driven primarily by our hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana 
the e i segment benefited from increased us government spending during fiscal and is well positioned to compete for projects that may be funded under the arra in fiscal year revenues revenues increased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year primarily due to increased volumes of services provided to the us government  led by increased construction activity on the hurricane protection project for the usace in southeast louisiana and our mox project 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year while gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross profit is primarily due to increased construction activity on a hurricane protection project noted above 
gross profit and gross profit percentage also increased due to overall improved project execution and increased amounts of overhead chargeable to contracts that results when the volume of project activity increases 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes  minority interest  and earnings from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above e c segment e c experienced record revenues and earnings during fiscal year as we worked off a number of high margin engineering projects in backlog 
however  e c s record performance on existing projects was coupled with an increasingly challenging marketplace  as the global recession had a substantial and negative impact on the investment decisions of clients in the oil and petrochemical markets 
many of our clients delayed large capital investments during fiscal year  and e c s bookings of new contracts declined as compared to the decline in bookings  combined with the work off of many high margin engineering services projects throughout fiscal year  led to a gradual decline in volume and profits in the second half of fiscal year and we expect this trend to continue into fiscal year however  we are seeing signs of renewed client interest in the early phases of major capital investments such as studies and front end engineering and design contracts which precede the engineering  procurement and construction phase of major projects 
we remain optimistic that bookings in the e c segment may increase if and to the extent that global economic conditions improve 

table of contents revenues revenues increased million  or  to  million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year due primarily to an overall increase in the volume of engineering services projects in general and on a major international petrochemical project in asia 
included in e c s revenues were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  of reimbursable client furnished materials for which we recognize no gross profit or loss 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year while gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage is primarily due to increased engineering service activity  increased activity on the major international petrochemical project noted above  strong project execution  and reduced estimated costs at completion related to foreign withholding taxes 
our fiscal year results included an increase in gross profit of million due to the release of performance guarantees at a consolidated joint venture 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes  minority interest  and earnings from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
however  the increase was partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses  primarily related to business development and proposal activities 
maintenance segment our maintenance segment experienced reduced activity in fiscal year versus fiscal year  as the global recession adversely impacted the primary markets this segment serves 
we performed fewer refueling outages for our nuclear electric utility clients in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  and we also performed fewer projects for our refining  chemical  and petrochemical clients who we believe delayed capital commitments because of economic conditions 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from  million in fiscal year this decrease in revenues is primarily due to lower volume of activity in both our power and process business lines 
additionally  we completed a major capital construction project in fiscal year that was not replaced in gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decreases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to lower overall business volume as well as reduced margin resulting from the impact of a dispute resolution reached in the second quarter of fiscal with the owner of a major domestic power project 
also contributing to the comparative decline in annual gross profit and gross profit percentage was the fact that we completed a major capital construction project in fiscal year  which produced higher gross profits when compared to the maintenance services provided in fiscal year income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes  minority interest  and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this 
table of contents decrease was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above  partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses resulting from various cost savings initiatives 
f m segment our f m segment achieved record business volume levels in fiscal year  as we continued to service global demand for our industry leading pipe and steel fabrication services  as well as for our manufacturing and distribution products 
however  toward the end of fiscal year  the global economic downturn began to negatively impact our end markets  particularly clients in the oil refining and chemical petrochemical industries 
as a result  our non nuclear bookings and profits declined in the second half of fiscal we expect the recent downturn in volume and profits to continue into the first half of fiscal year but subsequently to improve to the extent that the modular assembly and pipe fabrication work associated with the ap work subcontracted from our fossil  renewables nuclear segment commences 
revenues revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in revenues is primarily due to the execution of several large projects in our backlog as well as sales from our mexico facility  which commenced operation in late fiscal year gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decreases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to reduced client demand for pipe fabrication services which increased available capacity in our competitors facilities and resulted in a more competitive pricing environment income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income before income taxes  minority interest  and earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above 
investment in westinghouse segment the investment in westinghouse segment includes the financial results of our westinghouse equity and the corresponding jpy denominated debt that funded the investment which occurred on october  the total impact from the investment in westinghouse segment on our income before taxes and other items for fiscal years and  were losses of million and million  pre tax  and million and million  net of tax  respectively 
the losses were primarily attributable to increased non cash foreign currency translation losses resulting from revaluing the jpy debt to the us dollar equivalent at each quarter s end as the jpy appreciated against the us dollar in fiscal year in addition  the losses include million pre tax interest on the charges attributable to the expensing of the original issuance bond discount of million pre tax and the remaining deferred financing cost of million pre tax during fiscal year as a result of the toshiba event described in item business above 
income before tax from our westinghouse equity decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was related to a decline in westinghouse s profits associated with westinghouse s nuclear fuel sales and non epc related services 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the impact of exchange rate changes on our jpy cash interest payments on the westinghouse bonds 
we normally focus our hedge transactions to the jpy interest payments due within the following twelve months 

table of contents westinghouse maintains its accounting records for reporting to its majority owner  toshiba  on a calendar quarter basis with a march fiscal year end 
financial information about westinghouse s operations is available to us for westinghouse s calendar quarter periods 
as a result  we record our of westinghouse s earnings loss as reported to us by westinghouse based upon westinghouse s calendar quarterly reporting periods  or two months in arrears of our current reporting periods 
under this policy  the results of westinghouse s operations from july   through their calendar quarter ended june   were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august   and the results of westinghouse s operations from july   through their calendar quarter ended june   were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august  corporate general and administrative expenses g a corporate g a increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily related to increased labor and compensation costs  non income related tax expenses and certain employee related insurance costs 
however  this increase was substantially offset by a significant reduction in external consulting fees incurred in fiscal year associated with the remediation of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that existed at the time and lower fuel  repairs and maintenance costs associated with our corporate aircraft 
additionally  we initiated cost savings initiatives throughout fiscal year segment analysis fiscal year compared to fiscal year fossil  renewables nuclear segment our fossil  renewables nuclear segment experienced growth in demand in the areas of emissions control and new coal fired power generation facilities for regulated electric power utilities in the us additionally  we are performing early engineering work for six new nuclear power reactors in the us our international work in this segment increased due to a major services project in china 
revenues revenues increased  million  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to commencing and or continuing epc work on six new coal fired power plants in the us  continued progress on emission reduction projects such as fgd projects at coal fired power plants as full work authorizations were received and progress accelerated  continued activity on other coal fired power plant and acqs  and an increase in our nuclear activity due primarily to our services contract with a limited supply of equipment for four ap nuclear reactor units in china and preliminary engineering work on domestic ap units that were awarded in fiscal year the increase in revenues was partially offset by revenue declines attributable to several aqcs projects nearing substantial completion in the fiscal year 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our gross profit percentage rose to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in our gross profit and gross profit percentage were primarily due to commencing and or continuing epc work on six new coal fired power plants plus new work and continuing progress on several major fgd  aqcs projects at other coal fired power plant projects  and 
table of contents an increase in our nuclear activity due to continued progress on our china nuclear project  other engineering design work and additional authorizations on ap units 
the increases in gross profit and gross profit percentage were partially offset by a million net reduction in gross profit for the year resulting from an increase in the estimated costs at completion on a fixed price coal fired project due to increases in estimated field labor costs  availability of labor and certain indirect costs  a decrease due to several aqcs projects nearing substantial completion  increased costs on an international project completed in fiscal year where final settlement is in dispute with the main contractor  and an increase in facilities costs  proposal  and supervisory management costs incurred in anticipation of the development of the nuclear power market expected in the us and certain international markets 
the fossil  renewables nuclear segment has recorded revenues of million related to unapproved change orders and claims at august   on a percentage of completion basis 
the amounts included in our estimated total revenues at completion for these projects are estimated to be million at august  these unapproved change orders and claims relate to delays and costs attributable to others 
if we collect amounts different from the amounts we have estimated  those differences  which could be material  will be recognized as income or loss when realized 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the factors affecting gross profit discussed above as the segment has experienced strong revenue and gross profit growth from both the fossil and nuclear divisions 
e i segment our e i segment s revenues were relatively flat in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our federal services and commercial consulting and engineering services experienced growth in fiscal year which were offset by a decline in our commercial construction services 
revenues our revenues decreased million  or  to  million for fiscal year as compared to  million in fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in disaster recovery services in the us gulf coast  and a decrease commercial construction services 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal year was partially offset by increases in revenues attributed to activity from two consolidated joint ventures providing services to the doe  and an increase in services to our commercial consulting and engineering clients 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal year as compared to our gross profit percentage rose to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in our gross profit and gross profit percentage were due primarily to a loss recognized on a fixed price project in the middle east in fiscal year not incurred in  and 
table of contents favorable variance related labor utilization rates and a reduction in overhead labor and fringe costs 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in disaster recovery services in the us gulf coast  and a decrease in gross profit percentage from recording no gross profit on a consolidated military housing privatization joint venture 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in fiscal year due primarily to the factors impacting gross profit addressed above as well as a reduction in general and administrative expenses due to lower business development costs 
e c segment demand for chemical and petrochemical production and refinery capacity in the middle east and asia pacific regions provided a continued strong petrochemicals market  resulting in increasing activity levels for the e c segment in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year revenues revenues in our e c segment increased million  or  to  million for fiscal year from  million in fiscal year primarily due to higher revenues related to demand for our engineering and engineered equipment for the petrochemical and refinery businesses  an increase in client furnished materials million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively on two major international petrochemical projects  however  no gross profit is recognized from client furnished materials  and during fy  we began work on a major petrochemical plant in singapore 
the increase in revenues for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was partially offset by a decrease in services revenues from a major international petrochemical project that was at peak levels in the comparative prior fiscal year period  and a decrease in revenues from a gulf coast petrochemical fire rebuild project that was at a high services level in the comparative prior fiscal year period 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our gross profit percentage rose to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increases in our gross profit and gross profit percentage were due primarily to increased activity primarily associated with our engineering and engineered equipment projects 
a high level of contract losses recorded in the prior fiscal year as compared to the current fiscal year  and the release of license performance guarantees related to certain joint venture technology projects based on current estimates 

table of contents the increase in our gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was partially offset by the following lower service activity on two petrochemical projects which were at peak levels in the prior fiscal year  and higher indirect expenses due to the growth of our business 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase was due primarily to the changes in gross profit addressed above as well as foreign exchange transaction gains related to changes in currency exchange rates due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the us pound and euro during fiscal year and higher net interest income associated with improved cash flows at our e c segment offset by higher general and administrative expenses 
maintenance segment our maintenance segment experienced decreased activity during fiscal year  performing a lower volume of work in the power maintenance industry offset somewhat by an increase in capital construction work for our petrochemical clients 
revenues our revenues decreased million  or  to  million during fiscal year compared to  million for fiscal year due primarily to completion of a major domestic power construction project in fiscal year  the decision to no longer pursue maintenance work for an independent electric power company  and the overall decrease in the number of performed outages in the power maintenance industry 
the decreases noted above offset the increase in activity associated with the increased market demand for capital construction services in the petrochemical industry 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year our gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year the increase in our gross profit and gross profit percentage is due primarily to an increase in capital construction revenues which are traditionally executed at higher gross profit margins than routine maintenance services 
in addition  there were loss provisions recorded during fiscal year totaling million related to disputes with an owner over project incentives as well as losses recorded on two offshore production platform contracts 
our maintenance segment has recorded revenues to date of million related to our significant estimated  project incentives and unapproved change orders and claims at august  on a percentage of completion basis 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared million in fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to the changes in gross profit discussed above 
these increases were offset primarily by an increase in indirect expenses attributable partly to an increase in operations 
table of contents management 
also included in indirect expenses in fiscal year was a charge associated with the dissolution of a foreign entity 
f m segment in fiscal year  we experienced strong demand for our fabrication and manufacturing services 
strength in the global piping systems markets for oil refineries  power  petrochemical and chemical plants also expanded during that fiscal year 
we completed our fabrication facility in mexico in  and it is now our largest facility 
revenues our revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase is due primarily to significant new awards in both the domestic and foreign markets and the global increase in demand of our manufactured and fabricated products 
we experienced increases in the foreign and domestic market as a result of the increasing demand in the petrochemical  refining and power generation industries 
gross profit and gross profit percentage the increase in gross profit of million  or  to million in fiscal year as compared to million fiscal year our gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year this increase is attributable to the increase in demand for most of our products resulting in stronger volume and improved gross profit in both the domestic and foreign markets as discussed above 
income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities income loss before income taxes  minority interest  earnings losses from unconsolidated entities increased million  or  to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase is due primarily to the increases in revenues and the factors impacting gross profit discussed above

the increase in 
table of contents westinghouse s earnings is attributable to strength in westinghouse s nuclear fuel  nuclear services and nuclear power plants segments 
g a expenses for the investment in westinghouse segment were lower in fiscal year than for fiscal year due to costs incurred in fiscal year to obtain westinghouse audited financial statements in connection with the acquisition 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the impact of exchange rate changes on our jpy interest payments on the westinghouse bonds 
if we exercise the put option for our westinghouse equity  we would expect to recover a minimum of of our investment that was originally made in jpy 
westinghouse maintains its accounting records for reporting to its majority owner  toshiba  on a calendar quarter basis with a march fiscal year end 
we expect that reliable financial information about westinghouse s operations will be available to us for westinghouse s calendar quarter periods 
the results of westinghouse s operations from july   through their calendar quarter ended june   were included in our financial statements for the twelve months ended august  for the twelve months ended august   westinghouse s results from the acquisition effective date of october   through their calendar quarter ended june   a nine month period  were included in our financial results for the twelve months ended august  corporate general and administrative expenses g a decreased by million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to reductions in certain compensation costs and employee related insurance costs  which were charged to our other segments 
these cost reductions were partially offset by increased costs to support the increasing revenue base and level of business activity as well as increased consulting fees and audit fees 
liquidity and capital resources overview of fiscal years  and we generated record operating cash flow during  and at august   our cash and cash equivalents  restricted and escrowed cash and short term investments increased million  or  to a record  million from million at august  in addition to our cash and cash equivalents  we had million of revolving credit available for borrowings under our facility at august  subsequent to august  and as described below under credit facility we substantially increased the amount available to us under a new amended and restated credit facility 
operating cash flow was generated by all operating segments during fiscal year except our corporate and investment in westinghouse segments 
the cash flow was generated by earnings in each segment as well as from positive working capital movements primarily in the fossil  renewables nuclear segment 
we generated significant positive operating cash flows in fiscal year primarily from positive cash flows on projects being executed in our e c  fossil  renewables nuclear and f m segments 
we generated significant positive operating cash flows in fiscal year due primarily to collections by our e i segment of accounts receivable related to fiscal year disaster relief and emergency response services work and the positive cash performance on several epc projects in our fossil  renewables nuclear segment 
as our revenues have grown  so have our requirements to issue letters of credit to our clients 
while markets for our epc services continue to be strong  our ability to continue our revenue growth may be dependent on our ability to increase our letter of credit and surety bonding capacity  our ability to achieve timely release of existing letters of credit and surety bonds  and or our ability to obtain more favorable terms from our clients reducing letter of credit and surety requirements on new work 
our need for letter of credit 
table of contents capacity may increase as we begin executing future nuclear construction projects 
increases in the demand for performance letters of credit reduce the available borrowing capacity under our facility 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we extended our facility until april  and in september  which is subsequent to our fiscal year end  we increased the commitments under our facility and extended its duration until october see additional details below 
our excess cash is generally invested in either us treasury us government agency money funds  money market funds governed under rule a of the us investment company act of and rated aaa aaa by s p and or moody s investors service  respectively  or in interest bearing deposit accounts with commercial banks rated a a or better by standard poor s and or moody s investors service  respectively 
throughout most of fiscal we invested our cash in short term us government treasuries and money market funds that invest in us government securities
