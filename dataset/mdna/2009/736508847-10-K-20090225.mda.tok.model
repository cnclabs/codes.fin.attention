overview pge is a vertically integrated electric utility engaged in the generation  purchase  transmission  distribution  and retail sale of electricity in the state of oregon  as well as the wholesale sale of electricity and natural gas in the western united states and canada 
the company generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its service territory 
the company s revenues and income from operations are subject to fluctuations during the year due to the impacts of seasonal weather conditions on demand for electricity  price changes  customer usage patterns which are affected by the condition of the local economy  and the availability and price of purchased power and fuel 
pge is a winter peaking utility that typically experiences its highest retail energy sales during the winter heating season  with a slightly lower peak in the summer that generally results from air conditioning demand 
general rate case results on january   the opuc issued its final order concerning pge s general rate case and proposed tariffs  which became effective on january  pge s initial filing proposed an average price increase related to higher purchased power and fuel costs  increased investment in utility plant  and higher operating expenses  compared to the average price increase approved by the opuc 
the opuc approved a cost of capital that provides for a capital structure of equity and debt and a return on equity of 
the order authorizes million of increased revenues  consisting of approximately million for nvpc and million for other costs 
certain customer credits  including those related to results of the company s pcam  reduced the average price increase to approximately 
the opuc also authorized pge to file tariffs to implement a decoupling mechanism 
for further information  see decoupling mechanism in legal  regulatory and environmental matters in this item 
management is taking measures to manage costs in response to the final results of this general rate case 
current market conditions volatile capital market conditions have adversely affected both access to capital and the cost of capital in global markets 
pge is continually assessing the impact of these market conditions on its operations  which include  but are not limited to  the following impacts on the company s plans to issue capital stock or debt pge has estimated capital expenditure requirements of approximately million in and million in in addition to long term debt maturities of million in and million in although the current market conditions have made access to capital more difficult  pge has recently been successful in securing a new credit facility and issuing long term debt  which is discussed below in capital and financing 
pge believes it will be able to finance its ongoing 
table of contents capital projects in and anticipates issuing million of debt in  of which million was issued in january  and approximately million to million of equity in in addition  the interest rate and interest period on million of pollution control bonds expire may   which will require pge to remarket these bonds at current market rates or replace them with other debt instruments 
valuation of investments pge sponsors a pension plan 
the fair market value of investments held by the pension trust decreased substantially in pursuant to the pension protection act of  pge is legally obligated to maintain a certain funding level with respect to the pension plan 
the required funding level is determined annually based on certain actuarial assumptions and the valuation of the assets held by the pension trust 
as of january   although pge will not be required to fund a portion of the unfunded position of the pension plan in  it will be required to in  which is estimated to be million 
for future estimated contributions to the pension plan  see contractual obligations and commercial commitments in this item non qualified benefit plan and nuclear decommissioning assets  which include marketable securities  are held in separate trusts to cover pge s obligations under its non qualified benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning activities  respectively 
fluctuations in the fair market value of the non qualified benefit plan trust assets are recorded in current earnings

other demands on liquidity recently  pge has been required to provide increased collateral to counterparties pursuant to existing purchased power and natural gas agreements 
such collateral consists of both cash  classified as margin deposits on pge s consolidated balance sheet  and letters of credit 
these increased collateral requirements are primarily driven by decreases in the fair value of pge s outstanding contracts 
if wholesale power and natural gas prices continue to decline  pge may be required to provide additional collateral 
as of december   pge had provided million in collateral  consisting of million in cash and million in letters of credit  compared to million as of september   consisting of million in cash and million in letters of credit  and million as of december   consisting of million in cash and million in letters of credit

this amount  plus accrued interest million as of december   will be refunded to customers over a one year period beginning january  the above items  combined with other miscellaneous tariff changes  result in an overall retail price increase of approximately effective january  recent and pending rate actions include  but are not limited to  the following boardman deferral amortization on october   pge filed a request with the opuc to amortize the deferral of million of replacement power costs  plus accrued interest million as of december   associated with the forced outage of boardman from november  through february  in its filing  the company proposed that the amortization be offset with certain credits due to customers  with no price impact anticipated 
pge s request is subject to a regulatory proceeding that provides for both a prudency review with respect to the outage and to a regulated earnings test 
management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding 

table of contents utility rate treatment of income taxes sb pge filed its report with the opuc reflecting the amount of taxes paid by the company for the reporting year  as well as the amount of taxes authorized to be collected in rates 
the report is being reviewed as part of a formal process  with the opuc expected to issue an order in april pursuant to this report  pge has determined that the appropriate collection due from customers is million plus accrued interest  based on the opuc s administrative rules that govern the calculation of the amount 
such amount is included in regulatory assets as of december  under opuc rules  collections from customers will begin on june  power costs pursuant to the annual power cost update tariff process  pge annually files by april a preliminary estimate of the following year s forecasted power costs 
under this process  new rates become effective january of the following year 
in the event a general rate case is filed in any given year  forecasted power costs would be included in such filing 
renewable resources pursuant to a renewable adjustment clause mechanism rac  pge can recover in customer prices prudently incurred costs of renewable resources that are expected to be placed in service in the current year 
the company will submit an annual filing to the opuc by april  with rates to become effective january of the following year 
as part of the rac  the opuc has authorized the deferral of eligible costs not yet included in rates until the january effective date of the new rates 
under this mechanism  pge expects to file for recovery of its investments in biglow canyon phase ii and certain solar generating facilities in selective water withdrawal system under a stipulation in pge s general rate case proceeding  the company removed from requested rates recovery of its investment in the selective water withdrawal system at the pelton round butte generating facility 
however  the stipulation also provided for a process to recover the cost of this system through a separate proceeding  which is currently in process 
pge anticipates rate recovery of this system when the project is completed  which is expected in the second quarter of pge s initial filing in this matter indicated an annual revenue increase of million related to this project 
decoupling mechanism pursuant to authorization contained in the final order in pge s general rate case  the company on january  filed with the opuc an application to defer  for later ratemaking treatment  potential revenues associated with a new decoupling mechanism as well as revenues associated with a return on equity roe refund 
the decoupling mechanism is intended to allow recovery of reduced earnings resulting from a reduction in sales of electricity resulting from customers energy efficiency and conservation efforts 
it would be implemented under a new two year tariff that includes a sales normalization adjustment sna  for residential and small non residential customers  and a nonresidential lost revenue recovery lrr  for large non residential customers with loads less than mwa 
the sna is based on the difference between actual  weather adjusted usage per customer and that projected in pge s recent general rate case 
the lrr is based on the difference between energy efficiency savings as reported by the eto and those incorporated in the applicable load forecast 
the roe refund  estimated at approximately million annually  would reduce pge s allowed roe from  as approved by the opuc  to  and is intended to reflect a reduction in the company s risk associated with the decoupling mechanism

table of contents capital requirements pge has undertaken projects which will require significant capital spending in the next several years 
the following table presents management s projected primary cash requirements for through  as well as actual total capital expenditures for in millions years ending december  ongoing capital expenditures biglow canyon phase ii biglow canyon phase iii hydro licensing and construction smart meter project boardman emissions controls total capital expenditures long term debt maturities represents of estimated total costs 
for further explanation see boardman emissions controls below 
due to timing and cost uncertainties  estimated future expenditures related to the addition of up to mwa of renewable energy sources and significant new high voltage transmission projects including the southern crossing project proposed by pge are not included in the table above 
for further information  see integrated resource plan in the power and fuel supply section and the transmission and distribution section of item business 
the following provides information regarding the items presented in the table above 
ongoing capital expenditures consists of upgrades to and replacement of transmission  distribution and generation infrastructure  as well as new customer connections 
biglow canyon both phases ii and iii are currently under construction 
the estimated total cost of phase ii is million  including million of afdc  and phase iii is million  including million of afdc 
phases ii and iii are expected to be completed by the end of and  respectively  with installed capacities of mw and mw  respectively 
hydro licensing and construction as required under the year license that the ferc issued to pge in for its pelton round butte project on the deschutes river  pge began construction of a selective water withdrawal system in late in an effort to restore fish passage on the upper portion of the river 
the system will collect juvenile salmon and steelhead  allowing them to bypass the dam when migrating to the pacific ocean  and will regulate downstream water temperature 
completion of the system  at a total cost of approximately million to million  is expected in pge s portion of the costs is expected to be approximately million  including afdc 
the company filed an application with the ferc in to relicense the clackamas river hydroelectric projects 
a settlement agreement  resolving most of the issues raised in the licensing proceeding and providing for a year license term  was signed by the thirty three participating parties in march and was submitted to the ferc for review and approval 
in june  pge filed an application with the deq proposing final resolution to the remaining lower clackamas river temperature issues 
pending issuance of the new license  the project will operate under annual licenses 
table of contents issued by the ferc 
it is expected that the deq will complete its water quality certification process in and the ferc will issue a new license for the clackamas river projects in smart meter project pursuant to its smart meter project  pge plans to install approximately  new customer meters that will enable two way remote communication with the company 
approximately  new meters are being installed as part of the project s systems acceptance testing phase  with the remaining meters to be installed starting in and continuing into pge estimates the capital cost of the smart meter project to range from million to million 
the project is expected to provide improved services  operational efficiencies  and a reduction in future operating expenses 
boardman emissions controls in accordance with federal regional haze rules aimed at visibility impairment in several federally protected areas  the deq conducted an assessment of emission sources that has indicated that the boardman generating plant may cause or contribute to visibility impairment in several federally protected areas and would be subject to a regional haze best available retrofit technology bart determination 
in december  the deq issued a proposed plan that would require the installation of controls at boardman in three phases 
the first phase would require installation of controls for nitrogen oxides nox as required under the clean air act  with estimated completion in the second phase would address mercury and sulfur dioxide removal using a semi dry scrubber and bag house  with estimated completion in the deq proposes that these first two phases would meet federal requirements for installing bart 
the third phase would require the installation of selective catalytic reduction for additional nox control  with estimated completion in the deq proposes that the third phase would meet reasonable progress requirements towards haze emission reduction goals 
pge estimates that the deq proposed plan would cost between million and million of total costs  excluding afdc  in nominal dollars 
pge has no commitments in place at this time and cautions that the cost estimates are preliminary and subject to change 
the comment and public input period for the deq proposed plan has closed 
pge has commented with an alternative bart reasonable progress proposal that would allow for decision points along the deq timeline to provide flexibility to make the most responsible decision on future controls at those points 
the oeqc is expected to adopt a rule in april now that the public process has been completed 
the rule will be submitted to the epa for approval as part of the oregon regional haze state implementation plan sip 
the company expects the epa to issue a decision on the sip in early in  pge sold an undivided interest in boardman and a undivided interest in the pacific northwest intertie intertie transmission line jointly  the boardman assets to a third party financial institution purchaser 
this transaction reduced pge s ownership interest in boardman from to 
the purchaser leased the boardman assets to a lessee lessee unrelated to pge or the purchaser 
the term of the lease ends on december  concurrently with the sale  pge assigned to the lessee certain agreements for the sale of power and transmission services from boardman and the intertie p t agreements to a regulated electric utility utility unrelated to pge  the purchaser  or the lessee 
the payments by the utility under the p t agreements generally cover the payment obligations of the lessee under the lease  but do not cover all capital expenditures and are not expected to cover a material portion of the costs relating to the controls for the boardman generating plant 
the purchaser has certain rights to participate in the financing of the portion of the 
table of contents total cost attributable to its interest 
as a result of these agreements  pge s share of the total cost for the emission controls on the boardman generating plant is expected to be if the purchaser does not exercise its rights under the agreements to finance the portion of the total cost attributable to its interest 
at the expiration of the lease  and in certain other circumstances  pge has an option to repurchase the boardman assets 
as the regulatory requirements are clarified by the relevant agencies and the related costs more closely estimated  the company will further evaluate the economic prudence of these expenditures 
in doing so  the company will also consider additional costs such as taxes  emission fees and other costs that may be imposed under any future laws related to climate change  as well as the company s ability to recover these costs through the ratemaking process 
such additional costs  combined with any expenditures for controls  could constitute an investment in excess of what the plant can economically support 
the ultimate impact that the above regulatory requirements and emission controls will have on future operations  costs  or generating capacity of the company s thermal generating plants is not yet determinable and will be evaluated through the irp process 
pge will seek recovery of its costs through the ratemaking process 
liquidity pge s access to short term debt markets  including revolving credit from banks  provides necessary liquidity to support the company s current operating activities  including the purchase of electricity and fuel for the generation of electricity 
long term capital requirements are driven largely by capital expenditures for distribution  transmission  and generation facilities to support both new and existing customers and maturities of long term debt 
pge s liquidity and capital requirements can also be significantly affected by other working capital needs  including margin deposits related to wholesale market activities  which can vary depending upon the company s forward positions and the corresponding price curves 
as of december   pge had negative working capital of million compared to working capital of million as of december  this decrease in working capital is primarily driven by an increase in the net liabilities from price risk management activities of million during  which are classified as current in pge s consolidated balance sheets 
the regulatory asset related to price risk management is classified as noncurrent in pge s consolidated balance sheets  impacting the company s working capital 
these derivative instruments are recorded at their estimated fair value mark to market  as discussed in note  fair value of financial instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the commodities market experienced significant volatility which resulted in  among other things  decreased market prices for purchased power and natural gas in the second half of the year 
pursuant to regulatory accounting under sfas  the mark to market of pge s derivative instruments is deferred and  accordingly  the company s net regulatory asset related to price risk management increased million  with no impact to the statement of income 
pge has an unsecured million revolving credit facility credit facility with a group of banks that supplements operating cash flow and provides a primary source of liquidity 
the credit facility is for general corporate purposes and the issuance of standby letters of credit  as well as for supporting the company s commercial paper program  under which it may issue commercial paper for terms of up to days 
the commercial paper program requires the company to maintain unused revolving credit capacity at least equal to the amount of commercial paper issued

the million increase in these charges in was due primarily to the authorized recovery of both port westward and biglow canyon phase i  which were placed in service in june and december  respectively  and accelerated depreciation of existing meters which are being replaced as part of pge s smart meter project 
the company estimates that recovery of depreciation and amortization charges will be approximately million in combined with all other sources  cash provided by operations is estimated to be approximately million for  which reflects the return of approximately million of margin deposits held by certain wholesale customers and brokers as of december  the estimated return of margin deposits is primarily based on the timing of contracts settling coupled with projected future energy prices

the second series is for million to mature on january  at a fixed rate of 
as of december   total long term debt outstanding was  million 
as of february   the total long term debt outstanding was  million  which includes the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds in january pge s ability to secure sufficient long term capital at a reasonable cost is determined by its financial performance and outlook  capital expenditure requirements  and alternatives available to investors 
the company s ability to obtain and renew such financing depends on its credit ratings  as well as on credit markets  both generally and for electric utilities in particular 
management believes that  as of february   the availability of the credit facilities  the expected ability to issue long term debt and equity securities  and cash generated from operations would provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s anticipated capital and operating requirements 
however  the company s ability to issue long term debt and equity could be adversely affected by changes in capital market conditions 
the company anticipates issuing a total of approximately million of debt in  of which million was issued in january  and million to million of equity in in

the company attempts to maintain a common equity ratio common equity to total consolidated capitalization  including current debt maturities of approximately 
achievement of this objective while sustaining sufficient cash flow is necessary to maintain acceptable credit ratings and allow access to long term capital at attractive interest rates 
pge s common equity ratios were and as of december  and  respectively 
credit ratings and debt covenants in january  s p affirmed its corporate investment grade credit rating and revised its outlook on pge from stable to negative

these deposits  which are classified as margin deposits in pge s consolidated balance sheet  are based on the contract terms and commodity prices and can vary from period to period 
as of december   pge had posted approximately million of collateral with these counterparties  consisting of million in cash and million in letters of credit  million of which is affiliated with master netting agreements 
based on the company s energy portfolio  estimates of current energy market prices  and the level of collateral outstanding as of december   the approximate amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a single agency downgrade to below investment grade is approximately million and decreases to approximately million by december  the amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a dual agency downgrade to below investment grade is approximately million and decreases to approximately million by december  pge s financing arrangements do not contain ratings triggers that would result in the acceleration of required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade 
the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds requires that pge meet earnings coverage and security provisions set forth in the company s amended and restated articles of incorporation and the 
table of contents indenture of mortgage and deed of trust securing the bonds 
pge estimates that as of december   and after considering the issuance of the million of fmbs in january  it could issue up to approximately million of first mortgage bonds under the most restrictive issuance test in the indenture of mortgage and deed of trust 
any issuances would be subject to market conditions and amounts may be further limited by regulatory authorizations or by covenants and tests contained in other financing agreements 
pge also has the ability to release property from the lien of the indenture of mortgage and deed of trust on the basis of property additions  bond credits  and or deposits of cash

other financial obligations pge has entered into long term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of washington under which it has acquired a percentage of the output allocation of four hydroelectric projects the rocky reach  priest rapids  wanapum and wells hydroelectric projects 
the company is required to pay its proportionate share of the operating and debt service costs of the projects whether or not they are operable 
the contracts further provide that  should any other purchaser of output default on payments as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency  pge would be allocated a pro rata share of both the output and the operating and debt service costs of the defaulting

off balance sheet arrangements pge has no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are likely to have  a material current or future effect on its consolidated financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operation  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the consolidated financial statements and that require the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments to determine matters that are inherently uncertain 
regulatory accounting as a regulated utility  pge prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
the application of sfas results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenues and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries 
pge is subject to jurisdiction of the opuc  which reviews and approves the company s retail rates  ensuring that they provide the company an opportunity to earn a fair return on its investment 
the company s rates  as authorized by the opuc  are based on the cost of service and are designed to recover operating expenses and capital costs associated with generation  transmission and distribution assets used to provide regulated service to customers 
although changes in such rates are subject to a formal ratemaking process  it is expected that the opuc will continue to recognize all prudently incurred costs and authorize rates that allow for their recovery 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  however  pge would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
in addition  if pge determines that all or a portion of its utility operations no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas  the company would be required to adopt the provisions of sfas  revenue recognition in financial statements  which would require the company to write off those regulatory assets and liabilities related to operations that no longer meet requirements of sfas discontinued application of sfas could have a material impact on the company s results of operation and financial position 
asset retirement obligations sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 requires the recognition of asset retirement obligations aros  measured at estimated fair value  for legal obligations related to dismantlement and restoration costs associated with the 
table of contents retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which the liability is incurred 
upon initial recognition of aros that are measurable  the probability weighted future cash flows for the associated retirement costs  discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate  are recognized as both a liability and as an increase in the capitalized carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
due to the long lead time involved  a market risk premium cannot be determined for inclusion in future cash flows 
capitalized asset retirement costs are depreciated over the life of the related asset  with accretion of the aro liability classified as an operating expense on the statement of income 
on the statement of income  aros related to electric utility plant are included in depreciation and amortization expense  with those related to other property included in other income expense 
accumulated asset retirement removal costs that do not qualify as aros have been reclassified from accumulated depreciation to regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
revenue recognition retail revenue is billed monthly and is based on meter readings taken throughout the month 
at the end of each reporting period  pge estimates the revenue earned from the last meter read date through the last day of the month  which has not been billed as of the last day of the month 
such amount is classified as unbilled revenues in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
unbilled revenues is calculated based on each month s actual net retail system load  the number of days from the meter read date through the last day of the month  and current retail customer prices 
contingencies the company has unresolved legal and regulatory issues for which there is inherent uncertainty with respect to the ultimate outcome of the respective matter 
contingencies are evaluated based on sfas  accounting for contingencies  using the best information available 
in accordance with sfas  a material loss contingency is accrued and disclosed when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a range of probable loss is established  the minimum amount in the range is accrued  unless some other amount within the range appears to be a better estimate 
if the probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  no accrual is recorded  but the loss contingency is disclosed to the effect that it cannot be reasonably estimated 
material loss contingencies are disclosed when it is reasonably possible that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred 
reserves established reflect management s assessment of inherent risks  credit worthiness  and complexities involved in the collection process 
no assurance can be given for the ultimate outcome of any particular contingency 
price risk management pge engages in price risk management activities in its electric business  utilizing derivative instruments such as electricity forward  swap  and option contracts and natural gas forward  swap  option  and futures contracts to protect the company against variability in expected future cash flows due to associated price risk and to minimize net power costs for retail customers 
derivative contracts are accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
marking a contract to market consists of reevaluating the market value at the end of each reporting period for the entire term of the contract and recording any change in value difference between the contract price and current market price in either earnings or other comprehensive income for the 
table of contents period 
valuation of these financial instruments reflects management s best estimates of market prices  including closing new york mercantile exchange nymex and over the counter quotations  time value of money  and volatility factors underlying the commitments 
determining the fair value of these contracts requires the use of prices at which a buyer or seller could currently contract to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date termed forward prices 
forward price curves are used to determine the current fair market price of a commodity to be delivered in the future 
pge s forward price curves are created by utilizing actively quoted market indicators received from electronic and telephone brokers  industry publications  nymex  and other sources  and are validated using independent publications 
estimates used in creating forward price curves can change with market conditions and can be materially affected by unpredictable factors such as weather and the economy 
the difference between pge s forward price curves and four independently published price curves averages 
the difference at any single location  delivery date and commodity is less than 
for purchases and sales of forward physical or financial contracts  the mark to market value is the present value of the difference between pge s contracted price and the forward price multiplied by the total quantity of the contract 
for option contracts  a theoretical value is computed using standard financial models that utilize price volatility  price correlation  time to expiration  interest rate and price curves 
the mark to market of these options includes the premium paid or received as a component of the theoretical value 
pension plan pension expense is dependent on several assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of the plan 
primary assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and wage escalation 
these assumptions are evaluated by pge  reviewed annually with the plan actuaries and trust investment consultants  and updated in light of market changes  trends  and future expectations 
significant differences between assumptions and actual experience can have a material impact on the valuation of the pension benefit plan obligation and net periodic pension cost 
pge s pension discount rate is based on assumptions regarding rates of return on long term high quality bonds 
assumptions regarding the expected rate of return on plan assets are based on historical and projected average rates of return for current asset classes in the plan investment portfolio 
the expected rate of return reflects expected future returns for the portfolio  and was used in determining net periodic pension expense for the year 
changes in actuarial assumptions can also have a material effect on net periodic pension expense 
a reduction in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension expense by approximately million 
a reduction in the discount rate would not have had a material effect on net periodic pension expense

any variations in the company s market risk or credit risk may affect its future financial position  results of operation or cash flows  as discussed below 
risk management committee pge has a risk management committee rmc which is responsible for providing oversight of the adequacy and effectiveness of corporate policies  guidelines  and procedures for market and credit risk management related to the company s energy portfolio management activities 
the rmc  which provides quarterly reports to the audit committee of pge s board of directors  consists of officers and company representatives with responsibility for risk management  finance and accounting  legal  rates and regulatory affairs  power operations  and generation operations 
the rmc reviews and recommends for adoption policies and procedures  establishes risk limits subject to pge board approval  and monitors compliance with policies  procedures  and limits on a regular basis through reports and meetings 
commodity price risk pge s primary business is to provide electricity to its retail customers 
the company participates in the wholesale marketplace in order to balance its supply of power to meet the needs of its retail customers  manage risk  and administer its current long term wholesale contracts 
the company uses power purchase contracts to supplement its thermal  hydroelectric  and wind generation and to respond to fluctuations in the demand for electricity and variability in generating plant operations 
the company also enters into contracts for the purchase of fuel for the company s natural gas and coal fired generating units 
these contracts for the purchase of power and fuel expose the company to market risk 
the company uses instruments such as forward contracts  which may involve physical delivery of an energy commodity  swap agreements  which may require payments to  or receipt of payments from  counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity  and options and futures contracts to mitigate risk that arises from market fluctuations of commodity prices 
pge does not engage in trading activities 
gains and losses from instruments that reduce commodity price risks are recognized when settled in purchased power and fuel expense  or in wholesale revenue 
valuation of these financial instruments reflects management s best estimates of market prices  including closing nymex and over the counter quotations  time value of money  and volatility factors underlying the commitments 
pge actively manages its risk to ensure compliance with its risk management policies 
the company monitors open commodity positions in its energy portfolio that extend over the next months using a value at risk methodology  which measures the potential impact of market movements over a one day holding period using a variance covariance approach at a confidence interval 
the portfolio is modeled using net open power and natural gas positions  with power averaged over peak and off peak periods by month  and includes all financial and physical positions for the next months  including estimates of retail load and plant generation 
the risk factors include commodity prices for power and natural gas at various locations and do not include volumetric variability 
based on this methodology

pge s energy portfolio activities are subject to regulation  with related costs covered in retail prices approved by the opuc 
the timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses on certain derivative instruments and their realization and subsequent recovery in prices are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities to reflect the effects of regulation under sfas as contracts are settled  these deferrals reverse 
in pge s value at risk methodology  no amounts are included for potential deferrals under sfas foreign currency exchange rate risk pge is exposed to foreign currency risk associated with natural gas forward and swap contracts denominated in canadian dollars in its energy portfolio 
foreign currency risk is the risk of changes in value of pending financial obligations in foreign currencies that could occur prior to the settlement of the obligation due to a change in the value of that foreign currency in relation to the us dollar 
pge monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the canadian exchange rate with an appropriate hedging strategy 
as of december   a change in the value of the canadian dollar would result in an immaterial change in pre tax income for transactions that will settle over the next months 
interest rate risk to meet short term cash requirements  pge has established a program under which it may from time to time issue commercial paper for terms of up to days  such issuances are supported by the company s unsecured revolving credit facilities
