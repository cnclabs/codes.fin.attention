item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on rna interference  or rnai 
rnai is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and regulating the expression of specific genes 
since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes  the ability to silence genes selectively through rnai could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases 
we believe that drugs that work through rnai have the potential to become a broad new class of drugs  like small molecule  protein and antibody drugs 
using our intellectual property and the expertise we have built in rnai  we are developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know how that we apply in a systematic way to develop rnai therapeutics for a variety of diseases 
we are applying our technological expertise to build a pipeline of rnai therapeutics to address significant medical needs  many of which cannot effectively be addressed with small molecules or antibodies  the current major classes of drugs 
our lead rnai therapeutic program  aln rsv  is in phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of human respiratory syncytial virus  or rsv  infection  which is reported to be the leading cause of hospitalization in infants in the united states and also occurs in the elderly and in immune compromised adults 
in february  we reported positive results from our phase ii experimental rsv infection clinical trial  referred to as the gemini study 
in april  we initiated a second phase ii human clinical trial  which is currently ongoing  to assess the safety and tolerability of aerosolized aln rsv versus placebo in adult lung transplant patients naturally infected with rsv 
we recently formed collaborations with cubist pharmaceuticals  inc  or cubist  and kyowa hakko kirin co  ltd  or kyowa hakko  for the development and commercialization of products for rsv 
we will jointly develop and commercialize products for rsv in partnership with cubist in north america  cubist has responsibility for developing and commercializing these products in the rest of the world outside of asia  and kyowa hakko has the responsibility for developing and commercializing these products in asia 
in december  we submitted an investigational new drug application  or ind  to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for aln vsp  our first systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidate 
we are developing aln vsp for the treatment of liver cancers  including hepatocellular carcinoma and other solid tumors with liver involvement 
we received clearance from the fda in january to proceed with a phase i study 
we expect to initiate this study during the first half of the phase i study will be a multi center  open label  dose escalation trial to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous aln vsp in patients with advanced solid tumors with liver involvement 
we are also working on a number of programs in pre clinical development  including aln pcs  an rnai therapeutic candidate targeting a gene called proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type  or pcsk  for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  aln ttr  an rnai therapeutic candidate targeting the transthyretin  or ttr  gene  for the treatment of ttr amyloidosis  and aln htt  an rnai therapeutic candidate targeting the huntingtin gene  for the treatment of huntington s disease  which we are developing in collaboration with medtronic  inc  or medtronic 
we have additional discovery programs for rnai therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases 
in addition  we are working internally and with third party collaborators to develop capabilities to deliver our rnai therapeutics directly to specific sites of disease  such as the delivery of aln rsv to the lungs  which we refer to as direct rnai 
we are also working to extend our capabilities to advance the development of rnai therapeutics that are administered by intravenous  subcutaneous or intramuscular approaches  which we refer to as systemic rnai 
we have numerous rnai therapeutic delivery collaborations and intend to continue to collaborate with government  academic and corporate third parties to evaluate different delivery options  including with respect to direct rnai and systemic rnai 

table of contents we rely on the strength of our intellectual property portfolio relating to the development and commercialization of small interfering rnas  or sirnas  as therapeutics 
this includes ownership of  or exclusive rights to  issued patents and pending patent applications claiming fundamental features of sirnas and rnai therapeutics as well as those claiming crucial chemical modifications and promising delivery technologies 
we believe that no other company possesses a portfolio of such broad and exclusive rights to the patents and patent applications required for the commercialization of rnai therapeutics 
given the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our business operations  we intend to vigorously enforce our rights and defend against any challenges that have arisen or may arise in this area 
in addition  our expertise in rnai therapeutics and broad intellectual property estate have allowed us to form alliances with leading companies  including isis pharmaceuticals  inc  or isis  medtronic  novartis pharma ag  or novartis  biogen idec inc  or biogen idec  f 
hoffmann la roche ltd  or roche  takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda  kyowa hakko and cubist 
we have also entered into contracts with government agencies  including the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  or niaid  a component of the national institutes of health  or nih 
we have established collaborations with and  in some instances  received funding from major medical and disease associations 
finally  to further enable the field and monetize our intellectual property rights  we also grant licenses to biotechnology companies for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct strategic interest under our interferx tm program and to research companies that commercialize rnai reagents or services under our research product licenses 
we also seek opportunities to form new ventures in areas outside our core strategic interest 
for example  in  we and isis established regulus therapeutics llc  or regulus therapeutics  a company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of microrna based therapeutics 
because micrornas are believed to regulate whole networks of genes that can be involved in discrete disease processes  microrna based therapeutics represent a possible new approach to target the pathways of human disease 
given the broad applications for rnai technology  we believe additional opportunities exist for new ventures to be formed 
alnylam commenced operations in june we have focused our efforts since inception primarily on business planning  research and development  acquiring  filing and expanding intellectual property rights  recruiting management and technical staff  and raising capital 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
through december   we have funded our operations primarily through the net proceeds from the sale of equity securities and payments we have received under strategic alliances 
through december   a substantial portion of our total net revenues have been collaboration revenues derived from our strategic alliances with roche  takeda and novartis  and from the united states government in connection with our development of treatments for hemorrhagic fever viruses  including ebola 
we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from new and existing strategic alliances  government and foundation funding and license fee revenues 
we currently have programs focused in a number of therapeutic areas 
however  we are unable to predict when  if ever  we will successfully develop or be able to commence sales of any product 
we have never achieved profitability on an annual basis and we expect to incur additional losses over the next several years 
we expect our net losses to continue due primarily to research and development activities relating to our drug development programs  collaborations and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
therefore  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
our sources of potential funding for the next several years are expected to be derived primarily from payments under new and existing strategic alliances  which may include license and other fees  funded research and development payments and milestone payments  government and foundation funding and proceeds from the sale of equity 
research and development since our inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs 
research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses 
our most advanced program is focused on the treatment of rsv infection and is in phase ii clinical studies 
in january  we received clearance from the fda to proceed with a phase i study of aln vsp for the treatment of liver cancers and 
table of contents potentially other solid tumors 
our other development programs are focused on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  ttr amyloidosis and huntington s disease 
we also have discovery programs to develop rnai therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases  such as viral hemorrhagic fever  including the ebola virus  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  or pml  parkinson s disease and many other undisclosed programs  as well as several other diseases that are the subject of our strategic alliances 
in addition  we are working internally and with third party collaborators to develop capabilities to deliver our rnai therapeutics both directly to the specific sites of disease and systemically  and we intend to continue to collaborate with government  academic and corporate third parties to evaluate different delivery options 
there is a risk that any drug discovery or development program may not produce revenue for a variety of reasons  including the possibility that we will not be able to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate 
moreover  there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery  including rnai 
the successful development of any product candidate we develop is highly uncertain 
due to the numerous risks associated with developing drugs  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows will commence from  any potential product candidate 
these risks include the uncertainty of our ability to progress product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate and progress of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  including those related to developing safe and effective ways of delivering sirnas into cells and tissues  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  clinical trial results  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the terms  timing and success of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost  timing and success of regulatory filings and approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sufficient sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost and timing of establishing sufficient clinical and commercial supplies of any products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of any potential products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and the potential consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in item a above under the heading risk factors 
strategic alliances a significant component of our business plan is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  research foundations and others  as appropriate  to gain access to funding  capabilities  technical resources and intellectual property to further our development efforts and to generate revenues 
our collaboration strategy is to form non exclusive platform alliances where our collaborators obtain access to our capabilities and intellectual property to develop their own rnai therapeutic products  and co development and or ex us market geographic partnerships on specific rnai therapeutic programs 
we have entered into broad  non exclusive platform license agreements with roche and takeda  under which we will also collaborate with each of roche and takeda on rnai drug discovery for one or more disease targets 
we are pursuing co development programs with cubist and medtronic for the development and commercialization of aln rsv and aln htt  respectively 
in addition  we have entered into a product alliance with kyowa hakko for the development and commercialization of aln rsv in territories not 
table of contents covered by the cubist agreement  which include japan and other markets in asia 
we also have discovery and development alliances with isis  novartis and biogen idec 
we also seek opportunities to form new ventures in areas outside our core strategic interest 
for example  we formed regulus therapeutics  together with isis  to capitalize on our technology and intellectual property in the field of microrna based therapeutics 
given the broad applications for rnai technology  we believe additional opportunities exist for new ventures to be formed 
to generate revenues from our intellectual property rights  we also grant licenses to biotechnology companies under our interferx program for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct strategic interest 
we also license key aspects of our intellectual property to companies active in the research products and services market  which includes the manufacture and sale of reagents 
our interferx and research product licenses aim to generate modest near term revenues that we can re invest in the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline 
as of january   we had granted such licenses  on both an exclusive and nonexclusive basis  to approximately companies 
since delivery of rnai therapeutics remains a major objective of our research activities  we also look to form collaboration and licensing agreements with other companies and academic institutions to gain access to delivery technologies 
for example  we have formed agreements with tekmira pharmaceuticals corporation  or tekmira  and massachusetts institute of technology  or mit  among others  to focus on various delivery strategies 
we have also entered into license agreements with isis  max planck innovation  tekmira and mit  as well as a number of other entities  to obtain rights to important intellectual property in the field of rnai 
finally  we seek funding for the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline from foundations and government sources 
in  niaid awarded us a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic against hemorrhagic fever virus  including the ebola virus 
in  the defense threat reduction agency  or dtra  an agency of the united states department of defense  awarded us a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic for hemorrhagic fever virus  which contract ended in february in addition  we have obtained funding for pre clinical discovery programs from organizations such as the michael j 
fox foundation 
in september  we terminated our amended and restated research collaboration and license agreement with merck co  inc  or merck 
pursuant to the termination agreement  all license grants of intellectual property to develop  manufacture and or commercialize rnai therapeutic products under the amended and restated research collaboration and license agreement ceased as of the date of the termination agreement  subject to certain specified exceptions 
the termination agreement further provides that  subject to certain conditions  we and merck will each retain sole ownership and rights in our own intellectual property 
platform alliances 
roche 
in july  we and  for limited purposes  alnylam europe ag  or alnylam europe  entered into a license and collaboration agreement with roche 
under the license and collaboration agreement  which became effective in august  we granted roche a non exclusive license to our intellectual property to develop and commercialize therapeutic products that function through rnai  subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
the license is initially limited to the therapeutic areas of oncology  respiratory diseases  metabolic diseases and certain liver diseases  and may be expanded to include up to additional therapeutic areas  comprising all other fields of human disease  as identified and agreed upon by the parties  upon payment to us by roche of an additional million for each additional therapeutic area  if any 
in consideration for the rights granted to roche under the license and collaboration agreement  roche paid us million in upfront cash payments 
in addition  in exchange for our contributions under the collaboration agreement  for each rnai therapeutic product successfully developed by roche  its affiliates or sublicensees under the collaboration agreement  if any  we are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of specified development and sales events  totaling up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic target  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical 
table of contents development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from roche 
under the license and collaboration agreement  we and roche also agreed to collaborate on the discovery of rnai therapeutic products directed to one or more disease targets  subject to our contractual obligations to third parties 
the discovery collaboration between roche and us will be governed by a joint steering committee for a period of five years that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
in exchange for our contributions to the collaboration  roche will be required to make additional milestone and royalty payments to us 
in connection with the execution of the license and collaboration agreement  we executed a common stock purchase agreement with roche finance ltd  or roche finance  an affiliate of roche 
under the terms of the common stock purchase agreement  in august  roche finance purchased  shares of our common stock at per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in connection with the execution of the license and collaboration agreement and the common stock purchase agreement  we also executed a stock purchase agreement with alnylam europe and roche beteiligungs gmbh  or roche germany  an affiliate of roche 
under the terms of the alnylam europe stock purchase agreement  we created a new  wholly owned german limited liability company  roche kulmbach  into which substantially all of the non intellectual property assets of alnylam europe were transferred  and roche germany purchased from us all of the issued and outstanding shares of roche kulmbach for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the alnylam europe stock purchase agreement included transition services that were performed by roche kulmbach employees at various levels through august we reimbursed roche for these services at an agreed upon rate 
in connection with the license and collaboration agreement and the common stock purchase agreement  we paid million in license fees to our licensors  primarily isis  in accordance with the applicable license agreements with those parties 
takeda 
in may  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with takeda to pursue the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics 
under the takeda agreement  we granted to takeda a non exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license to our intellectual property to develop  manufacture  use and commercialize rnai therapeutics  subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
the license initially is limited to the fields of oncology and metabolic disease and may be expanded at takeda s option to include other therapeutic areas  subject to specified conditions 
under the takeda agreement  takeda will be our exclusive platform partner in the asian territory  as defined in the agreement  for a period of five years 
in consideration for the rights granted to takeda under the takeda agreement  takeda agreed to pay us million in upfront and near term technology transfer payments 
in addition  we have the option  exercisable until the start of phase iii development  to opt in under a profit sharing agreement to the development and commercialization in the united states of up to four takeda licensed products  and would be entitled to opt in rights for two additional products for each additional field expansion  if any  elected by takeda under the takeda agreement 
in june  takeda paid us an upfront payment of million 
takeda is also required to make the additional million in payments to us upon achievement of specified technology transfer milestones  million of which was achieved in september and paid in october  million of which is required to be paid within to months of execution of the agreement and million of which is required to be paid within to months of execution of the agreement 
if takeda elects to expand its license to additional therapeutic areas  takeda will be required to pay us million for each of up to approximately total additional fields selected  comprising all other fields of human disease  as identified and agreed upon by the parties 
in addition  for each rnai therapeutic product successfully developed by takeda  its affiliates and sublicensees  if any  we are entitled to receive specified development and commercialization milestones  totaling up to million per product  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from takeda 
pursuant to the takeda agreement  we and takeda have also agreed to collaborate on the research of rnai therapeutics directed to one or two disease targets agreed to by the parties  subject to our existing contractual obligations with third parties 
takeda also has the option  subject to certain conditions  to collaborate with us on the 
table of contents research and development of rnai drug delivery technology for targets agreed to by the parties 
in addition  takeda has a right of first negotiation for the development and commercialization of our rnai therapeutic products in the asian territory  excluding our aln rsv program 
in addition to our profit sharing option  we have a similar right of first negotiation to participate with takeda in the development and commercialization in the united states of licensed products 
the collaboration is governed by a joint technology transfer committee  or jttc  a joint research collaboration committee  or jrcc  and a joint delivery collaboration committee  or jdcc  each of which is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
in connection with the takeda agreement  we paid million of license fees to our licensors  primarily isis  in accordance with the applicable license agreements with those parties 
discovery and development alliances 
isis 
in march  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with isis  a leading developer of antisense oligonucleotide drugs that target rna 
the isis agreement significantly enhanced our intellectual property position with respect to rna based therapeutic products and our ability to develop sirnas for rnai therapeutic products  and provided us with the opportunity to defer investment in manufacturing technology 
isis granted us licenses to its current and future patents and patent applications relating to chemistry and to rna targeting mechanisms for the research  development and commercialization of sirna products 
we have the right to use isis technologies in our development programs or in collaborations  and isis has agreed not to grant licenses under these patents to any other organization for any sirna products designed to work through an rnai mechanism  except in the context of a collaboration in which isis plays an active role 
the licenses that we have granted to isis are non exclusive licenses to our current and future patents and patent applications relating to rna targeting mechanisms and to chemistry for research use 
we have also granted isis the non exclusive right to develop and commercialize sirna products against a limited number of targets 
in addition  we have granted isis non exclusive rights to our patents and patent applications for research  development and commercialization of antisense rna products 
under the terms of the isis agreement  we paid isis an upfront license fee of million 
we also agreed to pay isis milestone payments  totaling up to approximately million  upon the occurrence of specified development and regulatory events  and royalties on sales  if any  for each product that we or a collaborator develops using isis intellectual property 
in addition  we agreed to pay to isis a percentage of specified fees from strategic collaborations we may enter into that include access to the isis intellectual property 
in conjunction with the agreement  isis made a million equity investment in us 
in addition  isis has agreed to pay us  per therapeutic target  a license fee of million  and milestone payments totaling approximately million  payable upon the occurrence of specified development and regulatory events  and royalties on sales  if any  for each product developed by isis or a collaborator that utilizes our intellectual property 
isis has the right to elect up to ten non exclusive target licenses under the agreement and has the right to purchase one additional non exclusive target per year during the term of the collaboration 
the isis agreement also gives us an option to use isis manufacturing services for rna based therapeutic products 
in addition  under the isis agreement  we have the exclusive right to grant sub licenses for isis technology to third parties with whom we are not collaborating 
we may include these sub licenses in our non exclusive platform licenses and our interferx licenses 
if a license includes rights to isis intellectual property  we will share revenues from that license equally with isis 
novartis 
we have formed two alliances with novartis 
we refer to the first of these  which was initiated in september  as the broad novartis alliance  and to the second  which was initiated in february  as the novartis flu alliance 
in connection with the broad novartis alliance  we entered into a series of transactions with novartis beginning in september at that time  we and novartis executed a stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement 
when the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement closed in october  the investor rights agreement became effective and we and novartis executed a research collaboration and license agreement 
the collaboration and license agreement had an initial term of three years  with an option for two 
table of contents additional one year extensions at the election of novartis 
in july  novartis elected to extend the initial term for an additional year  through october novartis retains the right to extend the term for a second additional year  which right must be exercised no later than july under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement  the parties will work together on selected targets  as defined in the collaboration and license agreement  to discover and develop therapeutics based on rnai 
in consideration for rights granted to novartis under the collaboration and license agreement  novartis made an upfront payment of million to us in october  partly to reimburse prior costs incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
the collaboration and license agreement also includes terms under which novartis will provide us with research funding and development and sales milestone payments as well as royalties on annual net sales of products resulting from the collaboration  if any 
the amount of research funding provided by novartis under the collaboration and license agreement during the research term is dependent upon the number of active programs on which we are collaborating with them at any given time and the number of our employees that are working on those programs  in respect of which novartis reimburses us at an agreed upon rate 
under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement  novartis has the right to select up to exclusive targets to include in the collaboration  which number may be increased to under certain circumstances and upon additional payments 
for rnai therapeutic products successfully developed under the agreement  if any  we would be entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of certain specified development and annual net sales events  up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic product 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from novartis 
the collaboration and license agreement also provides novartis with a non exclusive option to integrate into its operations our intellectual property relating to rnai technology  excluding any technology related to delivery of nucleic acid based molecules 
novartis may exercise this integration option at any point during the research term  as defined in the collaboration and license agreement 
the research term expires in october and may be extended until october at novartis election 
in connection with the exercise of the integration option  novartis would be required to make additional payments to us totaling million  payable in full at the time of exercise  which payments would include an option exercise fee  a milestone based on the overall success of the collaboration and pre paid milestones and royalties that could become due as a result of future development of products using our technology 
in addition  under this license grant  novartis may be required to make milestone and royalty payments to us in connection with the successful development and commercialization of rnai therapeutic products  if any 
the license grant under the integration option  if exercised by novartis  would be structured similarly to our non exclusive platform licenses with roche and takeda 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement  in october  novartis purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million  which  after such issuance  represented of our outstanding common stock as of the date of issuance 
in addition  under the investor rights agreement  we granted novartis rights to acquire additional equity securities in the event that we propose to sell or issue any equity securities  subject to specified exceptions  as described in the investor rights agreement  such that novartis would be able to maintain its then current ownership percentage in our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to terms of the investor rights agreement  in may  novartis purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share resulting in a payment to us of million 
at december   novartis owned of our outstanding common stock 
in february  we entered into the novartis flu alliance 
under the terms of the novartis flu alliance  we and novartis have joint responsibility for the development of rnai therapeutics for pandemic flu 
this program was stopped and currently there are no specific resource commitments for this program 
biogen idec 
in september  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with biogen idec 
the collaboration is focused on the discovery and development of therapeutics based on rnai for the potential treatment of pml 
under the terms of the biogen idec agreement  we granted biogen idec an exclusive license to distribute  market and sell certain rnai therapeutics to treat pml and biogen idec has agreed to fund all related research and development activities 
we received an upfront million payment from biogen idec 
in addition  upon the successful development and utilization of a product resulting from the collaboration  if any  biogen idec 
table of contents would be required to pay us milestone payments  totaling million  and royalty payments on sales  if any 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from biogen idec 
the pace and scope of future development of this program is the responsibility of biogen idec 
we expect to expend limited resources on this program in product alliances 
medtronic 
in july  we entered into an amended and restated collaboration agreement with medtronic to pursue the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders 
the amended and restated collaboration agreement supersedes the collaboration agreement entered into by the parties in february  and continues the existing collaboration between the parties focusing on the delivery of rnai therapeutics to specific areas of the brain using implantable infusion systems 
under the terms of the amended and restated collaboration agreement  we and medtronic are continuing our existing development program focused on developing a combination drug device product for the treatment of huntington s disease 
in addition  we and medtronic may jointly agree to collaborate on additional product development programs for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases  which can be addressed by the delivery of sirnas discovered and developed using our rnai therapeutics platform to the human nervous system through implantable infusion devices developed by medtronic 
we will be responsible for supplying the sirna component and medtronic will be responsible for supplying the device component of any product resulting from the collaboration 
with respect to the initial product development program focused on huntington s disease  each party is funding of the development efforts for the united states while medtronic is responsible for funding development efforts outside the united states 
medtronic will commercialize any resulting products and pay royalties to us based on net sales of any such products  if any  which royalties in the united states are designed to approximate of the profit associated with the sale of such product and which royalties in europe are similar to more traditional pharmaceutical royalties  in that they are intended to reflect each party s contribution 
each party has the right to opt out of its obligation to fund the program under the agreement at certain stages  and the agreement provides for revised economics based on the timing of any such opt out 
other than pursuant to the initial product development program  and subject to specified exceptions  neither party may research  develop  manufacture or commercialize products that use implanted infusion devices for the direct delivery of sirnas to the human nervous system to treat huntington s disease during the term of such program 
kyowa hakko 
in june  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with kyowa hakko 
under the kyowa hakko agreement  we granted kyowa hakko an exclusive license to our intellectual property in japan and other markets in asia for the development and commercialization of aln rsv for the treatment of rsv infection 
the kyowa hakko agreement also covers additional rsv specific rnai therapeutic compounds that comprise the aln rsv program 
we retain all development and commercialization rights worldwide excluding the licensed territory 
under the terms of the kyowa hakko agreement  in june  kyowa hakko paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
in addition  kyowa hakko is required to make payments to us upon achievement of specified development and sales milestones totaling up to million  and royalty payments based on annual net sales  if any  of aln rsv by kyowa hakko  its affiliates and sublicensees in the licensed territory 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from kyowa hakko 
our collaboration with kyowa hakko is governed by a joint steering committee that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
under the agreement  kyowa hakko is establishing a development plan for aln rsv relating to the development activities to be undertaken in the licensed territory  with the initial focus on japan 
kyowa hakko is responsible  at its expense  for all development activities under the development plan that are reasonably necessary for the regulatory approval and commercialization of aln rsv in japan and the rest of the licensed territory 
we will be responsible for supply of the product to kyowa hakko under a supply 
table of contents agreement unless kyowa hakko elects  prior to the first commercial sale of the product in the licensed territory  to manufacture the product itself or arrange for a third party to manufacture the product 
cubist 
in january  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with cubist to develop and commercialize therapeutic products based on certain of our rnai technology for the treatment of rsv  including aln rsv  which is currently in phase ii clinical development for the treatment of rsv infection in adult lung transplant patients  as well as several other second generation rnai based rsv inhibitors  which currently are in pre clinical studies 
under the terms of the cubist agreement  we and cubist will share responsibility for developing licensed products in north america and will each bear one half of the related development costs 
our collaboration with cubist for the development of licensed products in north america will be governed by a joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
cubist will have the sole right to commercialize licensed products in north america with costs associated with such activities and any resulting profits or losses to be split equally between us and cubist 
throughout the rest of the world  referred to as the royalty territory  excluding asia  where we have previously partnered our aln rsv program with kyowa hakko  cubist will have an exclusive  royalty bearing license to develop and commercialize licensed products 
in consideration for the rights granted to cubist under the agreement  in january  cubist paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
cubist also has an obligation under the agreement to pay us milestone payments  totaling up to an aggregate of million  upon the achievement of specified development and sales events in the royalty territory 
in addition  if licensed products are successfully developed  cubist will be required to pay us double digit royalties on net sales of licensed products in the royalty territory  if any  subject to offsets under certain circumstances 
upon achievement of certain development milestones  we will have the right to convert the north american co development and profit sharing arrangement into a royalty bearing license and  in addition to royalties on net sales in north america  will be entitled to receive additional milestone payments totaling up to an aggregate of million upon achievement of specified development and sales events in north america  subject to the timing of the conversion by us and the regulatory status of a licensed product at the time of conversion 
if we make the conversion to a royalty bearing license with respect to north america  then north america becomes part of the royalty territory 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from cubist 
delivery initiatives we are working to extend our capabilities in developing technology to achieve effective and safe delivery of rnai therapeutics to a broad spectrum of organ and tissue types 
in connection with these efforts  we have entered into a number of agreements to evaluate and gain access to certain delivery technologies 
in some instances  we are also providing funding to support the advancement of these delivery technologies 
for example  in may of  we entered into an agreement with the mit  center for cancer research under which we are sponsoring an exclusive five year research program focused on the delivery of rnai therapeutics 
in addition  during  we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to the liposomal delivery formulation technology of tekmira for the discovery  development and commercialization of lipid based nanoparticle formulations for the delivery of rnai therapeutics 
in may  tekmira acquired protiva biotherapeutics inc  or protiva 
in connection with this acquisition  we entered into new agreements with tekmira and protiva  which provide us access to key existing and future technology and intellectual property for the systemic delivery of rnai therapeutics with liposomal delivery technologies 
under the new agreements with tekmira and protiva  we continue to have exclusive rights to the semple us patent no 
 and wheeler us patent nos 
 and  patents for rnai  which we believe are critical for the use of cationic liposomal delivery technology 
as noted above  we are developing aln vsp  a systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidate  for the treatment of liver cancers  including hepatocellular carcinoma and other solid tumors with liver involvement 
aln vsp comprises two sirnas formulated using tekmira s stable nucleic acid lipid particles  or snalp  technology 
we also have rights to use snalp technology in the advancement of our other systemically delivered rnai 
table of contents therapeutic programs  including aln pcs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and aln ttr for the treatment of ttr amyloidosis 
in connection with tekmira s acquisition of protiva  in may we made an equity investment of million in tekmira  purchasing  shares of tekmira common stock at a price of per share  which represented a premium of per share  or an aggregate of million 
this premium was calculated on the difference between the purchase price and the closing price of tekmira s common stock on the effective date of the acquisition 
we allocated this million premium to the expansion of our access to key technology and intellectual property rights and  accordingly  recorded a charge to research and development expense during the year ended december  during  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our investment in tekmira  as the decrease in the fair value of this investment was deemed to be other than temporary 
in connection with these transactions  we and tekmira cancelled our million capital equipment loan to tekmira  which was never drawn down by tekmira 
we have other rnai therapeutic delivery collaborations and intend to continue to collaborate with government  academic and corporate third parties to evaluate different delivery technologies  including with respect to direct rnai and systemic rnai 
government funding nih 
in september  niaid awarded us a contract for up to million over four years to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic for hemorrhagic fever virus  including the ebola virus 
the ebola virus can cause a severe  often fatal infection  and poses a potential biological safety risk and bioterrorism threat 
of the million in funding  the government initially committed to pay us up to million over the first two years of the contract 
in june  as a result of the progress of the program  the government awarded us an additional million  to be paid through september for the third year of the contract  together with any remaining funds carried over from the funding allocated for the first two years of the contract 
department of defense 
in august  dtra awarded us a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic for hemorrhagic fever virus 
the government initially committed to pay us up to million through february  which included a six month extension granted by dtra in july following a program review in early  we and dtra have determined to end this program and accordingly  the remaining funds of up to million will not be accessed 
micrornai based therapeutics regulus therapeutics 
in september  we and isis established regulus therapeutics  a company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of microrna based therapeutics 
regulus therapeutics combines our and isis technologies  know how and intellectual property relating to microrna based therapeutics 
since micrornas are believed to regulate the expression of broad networks of genes and biological pathways  microrna based therapeutics define a new and potentially high impact strategy to target multiple points on disease pathways 
regulus therapeutics  which had initially been established as a limited liability company  converted to a c corporation as of january  and changed its name to regulus therapeutics inc 
we and isis continue to own and  respectively  of regulus therapeutics 
regulus therapeutics continues to operate as an independent company with a separate board of directors  scientific advisory board and management team 
regulus therapeutics most advanced program  which is in pre clinical research  is a microrna based therapeutic candidate that targets mir  an endogenous host gene required for viral infection by the hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
hcv infection is a significant disease worldwide  for which emerging therapies target viral genes and  therefore  are prone to viral resistance 
regulus therapeutics is also pursuing a program that targets mir pre clinical studies by regulus therapeutics and collaborators have shown that mir is implicated in several therapeutic areas  including heart failure and fibrosis 
in addition to these programs  regulus therapeutics is also actively exploring additional areas for development of microrna based therapeutics  including cancer  other viral diseases  metabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases 

table of contents in april  regulus therapeutics entered into a worldwide strategic alliance with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  to discover  develop and market novel microrna targeted therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease 
in connection with this alliance  regulus therapeutics received million in upfront payments from gsk  including a million option fee and a loan of million evidenced by a promissory note guaranteed by isis and us that will convert into regulus therapeutics common stock under certain specified circumstances 
regulus therapeutics could be eligible to receive development  regulatory and sales milestone payments for each of the four microrna targeted therapeutics discovered and developed as part of the alliance  and would also receive royalty payments on worldwide sales of products resulting from the alliance  if any 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical and pre clinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  or eitf non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the license only if we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either not have stand alone value or have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method when we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 

table of contents revenue recognized under the proportional performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the proportional performance method  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  then revenue under the arrangement will be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line method  as of the period ending date 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
many of our collaboration agreements entitle us to additional payments upon the achievement of performance based milestones 
if the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration  the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration  such as up front fees and research funding  in our revenue model 
milestones that involve substantial effort on our part and the achievement of which are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration are considered substantive milestones 
substantive milestones are included in our revenue model when achievement of the milestone is considered probable 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period using the proportional performance or straight line method 
milestones that are tied to regulatory approval are not considered probable of being achieved until such approval is received 
milestones tied to counter party performance are not included in our revenue model until the performance conditions are met 
for revenue generating arrangements where we  as a vendor  provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator  as a customer  we apply the provisions of eitf eitf addresses the accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash payments to each other for services and or products 
a payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
payments to a customer that are deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of revenue  to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to date and probable future revenues  which include any unamortized deferred revenue balances  under all arrangements with such customer  and then as an expense 
payments that are not deemed to be a reduction of selling price would be recorded as an expense 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized within the next twelve months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
as of december   we had short term and long term deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  related to our collaborations 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short term and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next twelve months 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to the next twelve months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our current operating plan and  if our operating plan should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next twelve month period 

table of contents the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
novartis 
in consideration for rights granted to novartis under the collaboration and license agreement  novartis made an up front payment of million to us in october to partly reimburse costs previously incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
the collaboration and license agreement includes terms under which novartis will provide us with research funding 
in addition  for rnai therapeutic products successfully developed under the agreement  if any  we would be entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of certain specified development and annual net sales events  up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic product 
we initially recorded as deferred revenue the non refundable million up front payment and million premium that represents the difference between the purchase price and the closing price of our common stock on the date of the stock purchase from novartis 
in addition to these payments  research funding and certain milestone payments  the receipt of which is considered probable  are being amortized into revenue using the proportional performance method over the estimated duration of the novartis agreement  or ten years 
we only include milestone payments that we believe are probable of being received 
under this method  we estimate the level of effort to be expended over the term of the agreement and recognize revenue based on the lesser of the amount calculated based on the proportional performance of total expected revenue or the amount of non refundable payments earned 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  and to the extent they are within the period of performance  milestone payments will be recognized as revenue on a proportional performance basis over the contract s entire performance period  starting with the contract s commencement 
a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of total performance completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period under the proportional performance method 
we believe our estimated period of performance under the novartis agreement includes the three year term of the agreement  two one year extensions at the election of novartis and limited support as part of a technology transfer until the fifth anniversary of the termination of the agreement 
in july  novartis elected to extend the initial term of the agreement for an additional year  through october we continue to use an expected term of ten years in our proportional performance model 
we reevaluate the expected term when new information is known that could affect our estimate 
in the event our period of performance is different than we estimated  revenue recognition will be adjusted on a prospective basis 
roche 
we recorded million as deferred revenue in connection with the roche alliance 
this amount represents the aggregate proceeds received from roche of million  net of the amount allocated for financial statement purposes to the common stock issuance of million and the net book value of alnylam europe of million 
in exchange for our contributions under the collaboration agreement  for each rnai therapeutic product successfully developed by roche  its affiliates or sublicensees under the collaboration agreement  if any  we are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of specified development and sales events  totaling up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic target  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
in addition  we have agreed with roche to collaborate on the discovery of rnai therapeutic products directed to one or more disease targets  referred to as the discovery collaboration  subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
the collaboration between roche and us will be governed by a joint steering committee for a period of five years that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
our performance obligations under the license and collaboration agreement  including participation in the steering committee and research conducted as part of the discovery collaboration  are expected to cease five years from the effective date of the license and collaboration agreement 
the proceeds allocated to the common stock issuance of million were based on the fair value on the date the shares were issued 
we have concluded that the license issued to roche  the alnylam europe assets and employees  the steering committee services and the services we will be required to perform under the discovery 
table of contents collaboration should be treated as a single unit of accounting 
accordingly  the remaining consideration received has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized into revenue over the five year period during which we are required to provide services under the license and collaboration agreement 
we are recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over five years because we are unable to reasonably estimate the total level of effort required under the license and collaboration agreement 
when  and if  we are able to make a reasonable estimate of our remaining efforts under the collaboration  we will modify the method of recognition and utilize the proportional performance method 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period on a straight line basis 
takeda 
in consideration for the rights granted to takeda under the takeda agreement  takeda agreed to pay us million in upfront and near term technology transfer payments 
in june  takeda paid us an upfront payment of million 
takeda is also required to make an additional million in payments to us upon achievement of specified technology transfer milestones  million of which was paid in october  million of which is required to be paid within to months of execution of the agreement and million of which is required to be paid within to months of execution of the agreement 
if takeda elects to expand its license to additional therapeutic areas  takeda will be required to pay us million for each of up to approximately total additional fields selected  comprising all other fields of human disease  as identified and agreed upon by the parties 
in addition  for each rnai therapeutic product successfully developed by takeda  its affiliates and sublicensees  if any  we are entitled to receive specified development and commercialization milestones  totaling up to million per product  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
pursuant to the takeda agreement  we and takeda have also agreed to collaborate on the research of rnai therapeutics directed to one or two disease targets agreed to by the parties  subject to our existing contractual obligations with third parties 
takeda also has the option  subject to certain conditions  to collaborate with us on the research and development of rnai drug delivery technology for targets agreed to by the parties 
in addition  takeda has a right of first negotiation for the development and commercialization of our rnai therapeutic products in the asian territory  excluding our aln rsv program 
in addition to our profit sharing option  we have a similar right of first negotiation to participate with takeda in the development and commercialization in the united states of licensed products 
the collaboration is governed by a joint technology transfer committee  or jttc  a joint research collaboration committee  or jrcc  and a joint delivery collaboration committee  or jdcc  each of which is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
we have determined that the deliverables under the takeda agreement include the license  the joint committees the jttc  jrcc and jdcc  the technology transfer activities and the services that we will be obligated to perform under the research collaboration with takeda 
we have determined that  pursuant to eitf  the license and undelivered services ie  the joint committees and the research collaboration are not separable and  accordingly  the license and services are being treated as a single unit of accounting 
under the takeda agreement  the last elements to be delivered are the jdcc and jttc services  each of which has a life of no more than seven years 
we are initially recognizing the upfront payment of million  the first technology transfer milestone of million and the million of remaining technology transfer milestones  the receipt of which we believe is probable  on a straight line basis over seven years because we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of effort to fulfill these obligations  primarily because the effort required under the research collaboration is largely unknown 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period on a straight line basis 
we will continue to reassess whether we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to fulfill our obligations under the takeda agreement 
when  and if  we can make a reasonable estimate of our remaining efforts under the collaboration  we would modify our method of recognition and utilize a proportional performance method 
kyowa hakko 
under the terms of the kyowa hakko agreement  in june  kyowa hakko paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
in addition  kyowa hakko is required to make payments to us upon achievement of specified development and sales milestones totaling up to million  and royalty payments 
table of contents based on annual net sales  if any  of aln rsv by kyowa hakko  its affiliates and sublicenses in the licensed territory 
our collaboration with kyowa hakko is governed by a joint steering committee that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
kyowa hakko is responsible  at its expense  for all development activities under the development plan that are reasonably necessary for the regulatory approval and commercialization of aln rsv in japan and the rest of the licensed territory 
we will be responsible for supply of the product to kyowa hakko under a supply agreement unless kyowa hakko elects  prior to the first commercial sale of the product in the licensed territory  to manufacture the product itself or arrange for a third party to manufacture the product 
we have determined that the deliverables under the kyowa hakko agreement include the license  the joint steering committee  the manufacturing services and any additional rsv specific rnai therapeutic compounds that comprise the aln rsv program 
we have determined that pursuant to eitf  the individual deliverables are not separable and  accordingly  must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we are currently unable to reasonably estimate our period of performance under the kyowa hakko agreement  as we are unable to estimate the timeline of our deliverables related to the fixed price option granted to kyowa hakko for any additional compounds 
we are deferring all revenue under the kyowa hakko agreement until we are able to reasonably estimate our period of performance 
we will continue to reassess whether we can reasonably estimate the period of performance to fulfill our obligations under the kyowa hakko agreement 
government contracts 
revenue under government cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as we perform the underlying research and development activities 
accounting for income taxes effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  or fin  which clarifies the accounting for income tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on the derecognition of previously recognized deferred tax items  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under fin  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we operate in the united states and germany where our income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
we develop our cumulative probability assessment of the measurement of uncertain tax positions using internal experience  judgment and assistance from professional advisors 
estimates are refined as additional information becomes known 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from our current estimate may result in additional tax expense in future periods 
we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we estimate our exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establish reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
we provide income tax expense for federal alternative minimum tax  state and foreign taxes 
we generated us taxable income during due to the recognition of certain proceeds received from the roche alliance 
our us taxable income will be offset by net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax attributes 
however  we anticipate being subject to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 

table of contents at december   we had a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
at december   we had utilized all federal and massachusetts state net operating loss carryforwards and all federal and a significant portion of massachusetts state research and development credits and all foreign tax credits 
at december   we had million of state research and development credits remaining and million of california net operating losses 
we have placed a valuation allowance against the state net operating loss and state credit deferred tax assets as it is unlikely that we will realize these assets 
ownership changes  as defined in the internal revenue code  including those resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with our public offerings  may limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income or tax liability 
the amount of the limitation is determined in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
we have determined that there is no limitation on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in accordance with section of the internal revenue code in accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and  or sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
all stock based awards granted to non employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  under which compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of our publicly traded stock 
for stock option grants issued during the year ended december   we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility assumption of 
our expected life assumption is based on the equal weighting of our historical data and the historical data of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology peers 
our weighted average expected term was years for the year ended december  we utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life 
as of december   the estimated fair value of unvested employee awards was million  net of estimated forfeitures 
this amount will be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately years for these awards 
stock based employee compensation expense was million for the year ended december  however  the total amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in any future period cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of stock based payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the awards that actually vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will actually vest  and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested options as of december  ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
accounting for joint venture we account for our interest in regulus therapeutics using the equity method of accounting 
we have concluded that regulus therapeutics qualifies as a variable interest entity under fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 or fin r 
the limited liability company agreement contains transfer restrictions on each of isis and our interests and  as a result  we and isis are considered related parties under paragraph d of fin r 
because we and isis are related parties and collectively own of regulus therapeutics  the determination of which entity would be considered the primary beneficiary is based on which entity is most closely associated with regulus therapeutics 

table of contents following the guidance in paragraph of fin r  we have concluded that isis is the primary beneficiary and  accordingly  we have not consolidated regulus therapeutics and account for our investment under the equity method of accounting 
results of operations the following data summarizes the results of our operations for the periods indicated  in thousands year ended december  net revenues operating expenses loss from operations net loss discussion of results of operations for and the following table summarizes our total consolidated net revenues from research collaborators  for the periods indicated  in thousands year ended december  roche government contract takeda novartis interferx program  research reagent license and other other research collaborator total net revenues from research collaborators revenues increased significantly for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of our august alliance with roche  as well as our may alliance with takeda 
under the roche alliance  million is being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over five years  which equates to approximately million per quarter 
in connection with the roche alliance  roche kulmbach employees performed certain transition services for us at various levels through august we reimbursed roche for these services at an agreed upon rate 
we recorded as contra revenue a reduction of revenues million and million for these services during the years ended december  and  respectively 
under the takeda alliance  the million in upfront and technology transfer milestone payments made or due to us are being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over seven years  which equates to approximately million per quarter 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   government contract revenues increased primarily as a result of our collaboration with dtra  which began in the third quarter of following a program review in early  we and dtra have determined to end this program after february and accordingly  no additional funds will be accessed 
the increase in interferx program  research reagent licenses and other revenues for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was due to milestone payments from certain interferx licensees 
the decrease in novartis revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due in part to the wind down of the novartis flu alliance 
other research collaborator revenues decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to our termination of the merck collaboration agreement in september we were recognizing the remaining deferred revenue under the merck agreement on a straight line basis over the 
table of contents remaining period of expected performance of four years 
as a result of the termination  we recognized an aggregate of million during the third quarter of  which represented all of the remaining deferred revenue under the merck agreement 
in addition  during  we reduced the number of resources allocated to  and received lower external expense reimbursement under  our collaboration with biogen idec 
the pace and scope of future development under this collaboration is the responsibility of biogen idec 
we expect to expend limited resources on this program during total deferred revenue of million at december  consists of payments received from collaborators  primarily roche  takeda and kyowa hakko  that we have yet to recognize pursuant to our revenue recognition policies 
for the foreseeable future  we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from our alliances with roche  takeda and novartis  as well as other strategic alliances  collaborations  government contracts and licensing activities 
operating expenses the following tables summarize our operating expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total operating expenses  together with the changes  in thousands and percentages of of total total increase operating operating decrease expenses expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses research and development 
the following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expenses  together with the changes  in thousands and percentages of of increase expense expense decrease category category research and development external services compensation and related clinical trial and manufacturing license fees facilities related non cash stock based compensation lab supplies and materials other total research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to higher license fees during the prior period consisting of million in payments to certain entities  primarily isis  as a result of our alliance with roche  a non cash license fee of million and a cash license fee of million related to the issuance of our stock to tekmira during in connection with our original license agreement with tekmira  and million in payments for drug delivery related activities 
partially offsetting this decrease was million in payments made in to certain entities  primarily isis  as a result of the takeda alliance  as well as a charge of million in connection with our new tekmira license agreement and million associated with various intellectual property assets 

table of contents clinical trial and manufacturing expenses decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of higher clinical trial and manufacturing expenses in the prior period in support of our clinical program for rsv  for which we began phase ii trials in june partially offsetting these decreases  external services expenses increased during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of higher expenses related to our government programs  our rsv program and our pre clinical programs for the treatment of liver cancer and huntington s disease  as well as higher expenses associated with our drug delivery related collaborations 
in addition  compensation and related  lab supplies and materials  and facilities related expenses increased during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to additional research and development headcount to support our alliances and expanding product pipeline 
we expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development expenses and we expect that research and development expenses will remain consistent or increase slightly in as we continue development of our and our collaborators product candidates and focus on drug delivery related technologies 
we do not track actual costs for most of our research and development programs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a project by project basis because all of our programs are in the early stages of development 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development costs are not tracked by project as they benefit multiple projects or our technology platform 
however  our collaboration agreements contain cost sharing arrangements whereby certain costs incurred under the project are reimbursed 
costs reimbursed under the agreements typically include certain direct external costs and a negotiated full time equivalent labor rate for the actual time worked on the project 
in addition  we are reimbursed under our government contracts for certain allowable costs including direct internal and external costs

as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million as of december  the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was due primarily to our receipt of million of upfront cash and technology transfer milestone payments under our takeda alliance  partially offset by the funding of our operating expenses 
we invest primarily in cash equivalents  us government obligations  high grade corporate notes and commercial paper 
our investment objectives are  primarily  to assure liquidity and preservation of capital and  secondarily  to obtain investment income 
all of our investments in debt securities are recorded at fair value and are available for sale 
fair value is determined based on quoted market prices and models using observable data inputs 
we have not recorded any impairment charges to our fixed income marketable securities as of december  operating activities we have required significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities as a result of net losses since our inception 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to the proceeds received from our august roche alliance  partially offset by the proceeds received from our may alliance with takeda 
offsetting the proceeds from the takeda alliance  the main components of our use of cash in operating activities for the year ended december  consisted of the net loss and changes in our working capital 
cash used in operating activities is adjusted for non cash items to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by or used in operating activities 
these non cash adjustments consist primarily of stock based compensation  equity in loss of joint venture and depreciation and amortization 
we had an increase in deferred revenue of million for the year ended december  due primarily to the proceeds received from our takeda and kyowa hakko alliances 
we expect that we will require significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and advance our research and development initiatives 
the actual amount of overall expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of expenses  the timing and terms of collaboration agreements or other strategic transactions  if any  and the timing and progress of our research and development efforts

during  we borrowed an aggregate of million from oxford pursuant to the agreement 
in may  we borrowed an aggregate of million from oxford pursuant to the agreement 
in march  we entered into an equipment line of credit with lighthouse to finance leasehold improvements and equipment purchases of up to million 
on the maturity of each equipment advance under the lighthouse line of credit  we were required to pay  in addition to the principal and interest due  an additional amount of of the original principal 
this amount was being accrued over the applicable borrowing period as additional interest expense 
in december  we defeased the aggregate outstanding balance under the oxford and lighthouse credit lines 
during the current downturn in global financial markets  some companies have experienced difficulties accessing their cash equivalents  investment securities and raising capital generally  which have had a material adverse impact on their liquidity 
in addition  the current economic downturn has severely diminished the availability of capital and may limit our ability to access these markets to obtain financing in the future 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities  for which we have not recognized any impairment charges  together with the cash we expect to generate under our current alliances  including our novartis  roche and takeda alliances  will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next several years  during which time we expect to further the development of our product candidates  conduct clinical trials  extend the capabilities of our technology platform and continue to prosecute patent applications and otherwise build and maintain our patent portfolio 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to develop  commence clinical trials for and commercialize any product candidates 
in the longer term  we may seek additional funding through additional collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise pursue 
even if we are able to raise additional funds in a timely manner  our future capital requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on many factors  including our progress in demonstrating that sirnas can be active as drugs  our ability to develop relatively standard procedures for selecting and modifying sirna drug candidates  progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the timing  receipt and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  from present and future collaborators  if any  the timing  receipt and amount of funding under current and future government contracts  if any  our ability to maintain and establish additional collaborative arrangements

off balance sheet arrangements in connection with a certain license agreement  we are required to indemnify the licensor for certain damages arising in connection with the intellectual property rights licensed under the agreement 
in addition  we are a party to a number of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business  which contain typical provisions  which obligate us to indemnify the other parties to such agreements upon the occurrence of certain events 
these indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments as of december   as well as obligations related to contracts that we are likely to continue  regardless of the fact that they were cancelable as of december  some of the figures that we include in this table are based on management s estimate and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we implemented sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
our partial adoption of sfas has had no impact on our operating results or financial position 
we are evaluating the impact  if any  full adoption of sfas will have on our nonfinancial assets and liabilities within the scope of sfas in december  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf requires collaborators to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational and consistently applied accounting policy election 
further  eitf clarifies that the determination of whether transactions within a collaborative arrangement are part of a vendor customer or analogous relationship subject to eitf eitf became effective on january  we are evaluating the potential impact of eitf on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
our marketable securities consist of us government obligations  high grade corporate notes and commercial paper 
all of our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
our available for sale investments in debt securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in the credit ratings of the issuers 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
a decrease in market interest rates at december  would impact the net fair value of such interest sensitive financial instruments by million 
a downgrade in the credit rating of an issuer of a debt security or further deterioration of the credit markets could result in a decline in the fair value of the debt instruments 
our investment guidelines prohibit investment in auction rate securities and we do not believe we have any direct exposure to losses relating from mortgage based securities or derivatives related thereto such as credit default swaps 
we have not recorded any impairment charges to our fixed income marketable securities as of december
