item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires  with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries  including the united states 
we operate our business through four operating segments representing our regional tire businesses north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
during the first quarter of  we formed a new strategic business unit  europe  middle east and africa tire  by combining our former european union tire and eastern europe  middle east and africa tire business units and have aligned the external presentation of our results with the current management and operating structure 
prior year amounts have been restated to conform to this change 
as a result of the sale of substantially all of our engineered products business on july   we have reported the results of that segment as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  all disclosures in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relate to continuing operations 
we experienced difficult industry conditions during as the global economic slowdown increased both in severity and geographic scope throughout the course of the year 
these industry conditions were characterized by dramatically lower motor vehicle sales and production  weakness in the demand for replacement tires  a trend toward lower miles driven in the us and recessionary economic conditions in many parts of the world 
in addition  raw material costs were at historically high levels during much of and remain volatile 
in spite of these extraordinary industry conditions  we had several key achievements during global revenue per tire increased  excluding foreign currency translation  we reported record revenue in emea  latin american tire and asia pacific tire  and record segment operating income in latin american tire and asia pacific tire  price and product mix improvements more than offset raw material cost increases of approximately  we completed the implementation of the veba  and we continued to make significant progress against our four point cost savings plan  as described below 
these achievements and the business model changes we have implemented over the last several years provide us a base from which we can address the challenging business environment that we are facing in we remain focused on top line growth  our cost structure and managing cash flow  and are pursuing several strategic initiatives in these areas  including raising our four point cost savings plan target to billion  by increasing our continuous improvement efforts  lowering our manufacturing costs  increasing purchasing savings  eliminating non essential discretionary spending  and reducing overhead and development costs  reducing manufacturing capacity by million to million units over the next two years  reducing inventory levels by over million in  adjusting planned capital expenditures to between million and million in  pursuing additional non core asset sales  continuing our focus on consumer driven product development and innovation by introducing more than new tires globally  and engaging in active contingency planning 

table of contents consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million compared to net income of million in we recorded a loss from continuing operations in of million compared to income from continuing operations of million in in addition  our total segment operating income for was million compared to  million in see results of operations segment information for additional information 
our results were impacted unfavorably by the recessionary economic conditions  particularly in the fourth quarter  resulting in lower sales that prompted us to reduce our global production 
for the year we reduced global production capacity by million units  of which million units were reduced in the fourth quarter 
as a result  we incurred significant under absorbed fixed overhead costs in the fourth quarter 
in addition  raw material costs increased versus the same quarter a year ago 
four point cost savings plan we have announced a four point cost savings plan which includes continuous improvement programs  reducing high cost manufacturing capacity  leveraging our global position by increasing low cost country sourcing  and reducing selling  administrative and general expense 
we expect to achieve billion of aggregate gross cost savings from through compared with the expected cost reductions consist of more than billion of estimated savings related to continuous improvement initiatives  including business process improvements  such as six sigma and lean manufacturing  manufacturing efficiencies  product reformulations and safety programs  and ongoing savings that we expect to achieve from our master labor agreement with the usw through december   we estimate we have achieved nearly billion in savings under these initiatives  more than million of estimated savings from the reduction of high cost manufacturing capacity by over million units the closure of our somerton  australia plant completed this element of our four point cost savings plan  between million to million of estimated savings related to our sourcing strategy of increasing our procurement of tires  raw materials  capital equipment and indirect materials from low cost countries through december   we estimate we have achieved nearly million in savings under this strategy  more than million of estimated savings from reductions in selling  administrative and general expense related to initiatives including benefit plan changes  back office and warehouse consolidations  supply chain improvements  legal entity reductions and headcount rationalizations through december   we estimate we have achieved more than million in savings under these efforts 
execution of our four point cost savings plan and realization of the projected savings is critical to our success 
voluntary employees beneficiary association during  we made cash contributions totaling  million to an independent voluntary employees beneficiary association veba  which is intended to provide healthcare benefits for current and future domestic usw retirees 
the funding of the veba and subsequent settlement accounting reduced our opeb liability by  million 
the savings we expect to achieve from the veba are included in our anticipated continuous improvement savings described above under four point cost savings plan 
pension and benefit plans during  our company pension funds experienced market losses  which decreased plan assets by  million which  in addition to other actuarial losses  increased accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl at december  by  million 
the domestic pension plan asset losses experienced during decreased us plan assets at december  by  million and increased net actuarial losses included in aocl at december  by  million 
as a result  annual domestic net periodic pension cost will increase to 
table of contents approximately million to million in from million in  primarily due to amortization of higher net actuarial losses from aocl and the expected return on lower plan assets 
in  we announced various changes to our us based retail and salaried employee pension and retiree benefit plans 
these changes were phased in over a two year period 
as a result of the changes  we achieved after tax savings of approximately million in  and approximately million in  and expect to achieve after tax savings of million to million in and beyond  based on assumptions which existed at the time the benefit plan changes were announced 
the ongoing savings are included in our targeted savings from continuous improvement initiatives and reductions in selling  administrative and general expense described above under four point cost savings plan 
we recorded a curtailment charge of million related to these actions in the first quarter of capital structure improvements during  we continued to take actions that resulted in improvements to our capital structure by repaying higher interest bearing debt obligations  increasing funding capacity and extending maturities during the first quarter of  we redeemed our million senior secured notes due  during the third quarter of  certain of our european subsidiaries amended and restated our pan european accounts receivable securitization facility to increase the funding capacity of that facility from million to million and to extend the expiration date from to liquidity at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents as well as  million of unused availability under our various credit agreements  compared to  million and  million  respectively  at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to our planned actions  including contributions to the veba of  million  capital expenditures of  million  the early redemption of our million senior secured notes due and the maturity and repayment of our million notes 
partially offsetting the reductions in cash was million in borrowings on our billion first lien revolving credit facility during the third quarter of due to a delay in receiving funds invested in the reserve primary fund  to support seasonal working capital needs and to enhance our cash liquidity position in an uncertain global economic environment 
we believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment 
new products at our north american dealer conference in early february  we responded to both consumer research and retail level requests with the introduction of several key tires most notably  the goodyear assurance fuel max and goodyear wrangler mt r with kevlar 
the assurance fuel max is a mid tier passenger tire targeted at the everyday consumer who is looking for an all purpose tire and also wants to save on fuel costs 
the wrangler mt r with kevlar is the next generation in the popular wrangler mt r line  and features kevlar reinforced sidewalls and an asymmetric tread design for superior off road performance 
complementing this new wrangler is the wrangler duratrac  which is a versatile on off road tire that is especially suited for work applications 
in europe  goodyear continues to focus on tire innovations that are relevant to consumers and unique versus our competition 
the efficientgrip tire with fuel saving technology has improved wet braking distance  while providing better mileage and rolling resistance to reduce fuel consumption 
we expect to introduce more than new tires globally in

income tax expense in includes a net tax benefit totaling million  which consists of a tax benefit of million per share related to prior periods offset by a million charge primarily related to recently enacted tax law changes 
the out of period adjustment related to our correction of the inflation adjustment on equity of our subsidiary in colombia as a permanent tax benefit rather than as a temporary tax benefit dating back as far as  with no individual year being significantly affected 
our losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
however  in certain foreign locations  it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all  or a portion  of these valuation allowances within the next months will exist  resulting in one time tax benefits of up to million million net of minority interest

the savings realized in for the plans totaled approximately million in sag 
in addition  savings realized in for the plans totaled approximately million million cgs and million sag compared to our estimate of million 
savings related to rationalization activities is less than the prior year estimate primarily due to implementation delays

on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  based on currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods 
our critical accounting policies relate to general and product liability and other litigation  workers compensation  recoverability of goodwill  deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions  and pensions and other postretirement benefits 
general and product liability and other litigation 
general and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on management s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable 
if the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the estimated loss 
if the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another  we record the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel 
court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss  which may have an impact on our reported results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer 
specifically  we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain 
table of contents rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past  or in certain of our facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in federal and state courts 
we engage an independent asbestos valuation firm  bates white  llc bates  to review our existing reserves for pending asbestos claims  provide a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims  and estimate our receivables from probable insurance recoveries related to such claims 
a significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated  and that increase may be significant 
we had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims  inclusive of defense costs  totaling million at december  the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was million 
at december   we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities could exceed our recorded reserve by million to million  approximately of which would be recoverable by our accessible policy limits 
we maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
we record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
this determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration relevant factors or agreements in principle  including ongoing legal proceedings with certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers  their financial viability  their legal obligations and other pertinent facts 
bates also assists us in valuing receivables to be recorded for probable insurance recoveries 
based upon the model employed by bates  as of december   i we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million  and ii we expect that approximately of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability 
the receivables recorded consist of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers 
of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts receivable at december  workers compensation 
we had recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  of million for anticipated costs related to workers compensation claims at december  the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
we periodically  and at least annually  update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses 
the liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return 
for further information on general and product liability and other litigation  and workers compensation  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 commitments and contingent liabilities 
recoverability of goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized 
rather  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present 
we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire which was formed in the first quarter of by combining our former european union tire and eastern europe  middle east and africa tire business units  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units 
other than the formation of the new europe  middle east and africa business unit during  there have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated 
for purposes of our annual impairment testing  which is conducted as of july each year  we determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units using a valuation methodology based on an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple of comparable companies 
the ebitda multiple is adjusted if necessary to reflect local market conditions and recent transactions 
the ebitda of the reporting units 
table of contents is based on a combination of historical and forecasted results and is adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items and corporate charges 
we consider significant decreases in forecasted ebitda in future periods to be an indication of a potential impairment 
at the time of our determination  valuation multiples of comparable companies would have to decline in excess of to indicate a potential goodwill impairment 
however  at december   as a result of the emergence of certain impairment indicators including the decrease in our market capitalization and the economic outlook in the united states  we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis for our north american tire business unit 
goodwill was million at december  our annual impairment analysis for as well as our interim analysis for north american tire at december   indicated no impairment of goodwill 
in addition  there were no events or circumstances that indicated the impairment test should be re performed for goodwill for segments other than north american tire at december  deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions 
at december   we had a valuation allowance aggregating billion against all of our net federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets 
we assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our losses in the us and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net federal  state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 income taxes 
pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions  including life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  future compensation levels  future health care costs  and maximum company covered benefit costs 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries 
assumptions about life expectancies  retirement rates  future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends  including an assumption about inflation 
the discount rate for our us plans is derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated aa or higher by standard poor s as of december and is reviewed annually 
the total cash flows provided by the portfolio are similar to the timing of our expected 
table of contents benefit payment cash flows 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our us pension fund over a period of years or more  estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation 
actual domestic pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis 
these assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate 
changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected 
the discount rate used in estimating the total liability for both our us pension and other postretirement plans was at december   compared to and  respectively  at december  the increase in the discount rate at december  was due primarily to higher interest rate yields on highly rated corporate bonds 
interest cost included in our us net periodic pension cost was million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost was lower in as a result of the reduction in the postretirement liability due to the veba settlement 
the following table presents the sensitivity of our us projected pension benefit obligation  accumulated other postretirement obligation  shareholders equity  and expense to the indicated increase decrease in key assumptions change at december  dollars in millions change pbo abo equity expense pensions assumption discount rate actual return on assets n a expected return on assets n a n a other postretirement benefits assumption discount rate health care cost trends total cost a significant portion of the net actuarial loss included in aocl of  million in our us pension plans as of december  is a result of plan asset losses and the overall decline in us discount rates over time 
for purposes of determining our us net periodic pension expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of the net actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of net actuarial losses in if our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of december   actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 
the actual rate of return on our us pension fund was  and in  and  respectively  as compared to the expected rate of for all three years 
the negative return of our us pension fund in was due to the steep market losses experienced during the year 
despite the losses experienced by the us pension fund in  the expected long term rate of return on assets will remain at for we use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our us pension plans 
the service cost of our us pension plans was million in and is expected to decrease in and beyond as the number of active participants accruing service declines 
although we experienced an increase in our us discount rate at the end of  a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in aocl of million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of december  is a result of the overall decline in us discount rates over time 
the net actuarial loss increased 
table of contents from due to the veba settlement  which resulted in the recognition of net actuarial gains previously included in aocl for the affected plans  offset somewhat by the increase in the discount rate at december  for purposes of determining worldwide net periodic postretirement benefits cost  we recognized million of the net actuarial losses in we will recognize approximately million of net actuarial losses in if our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of december   actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 
the weighted average amortization period for employees covered by our us plans is approximately years

results of operations segment information segment information reflects our strategic business units sbus  which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition 
the tire businesses are segmented on a regional basis 
as previously mentioned  during the first quarter of  we formed a new strategic business unit  europe  middle east and africa tire  by combining our former european union tire and eastern europe  middle east and africa tire business units 
prior year amounts have been restated to conform to this change 
results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income 
segment operating income includes transfers to other sbus 
segment operating income is computed as follows net sales less cgs excluding certain accelerated depreciation charges and asset impairment charges and sag including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses 
segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates 
segment operating income does not include rationalization charges credits  assets sales and certain other items 
total segment operating income was million in  billion in and million in total segment operating margin segment operating income divided by segment sales in was  compared to in and in management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our sbus and excludes items not directly related to the sbus for performance evaluation purposes 
total segment operating income is the sum of the individual sbus segment operating income

table of contents our ability to service debt and operational requirements depends in part on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group  whether in the form of dividends  loans or otherwise 
in certain countries where we operate  transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends  loans or advances are generally or periodically subject to various restrictions 
the primary restriction is that  in certain countries  we must obtain approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country 
in addition  certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments restrict the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash 
thus  we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt 
because of the inherent uncertainty of overcoming these restrictions  we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries that are subject to such restrictions to be integral to our liquidity or readily available to service our debt and operational requirements 
at december   approximately million of net assets were subject to such restrictions  compared to approximately million at december  operating activities net cash provided by used in operating activities of continuing operations was million in  compared to million in the increase in net cash used in operating activities was due primarily to the  million contributions made to the veba partially offset by lower pension contributions and direct payments

ebitda per our amended and restated credit facilities our amended and restated credit facilities state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if  after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment  our ratio of ebitda as defined in those facilities covenant ebitda to consolidated interest expense as defined in those facilities for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed to certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments 
in addition  if the amount of availability under our first lien revolving credit facility plus our available cash as defined in that facility is less than million  we may not permit our ratio of covenant ebitda to consolidated interest expense to be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
covenant ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results  but rather as a measure of these limitations imposed under our credit facilities 
covenant ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to either i income from operations or ii cash flows from operating activities 
our failure to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
as a limitation on our ability to incur debt in accordance with our credit facilities could affect our liquidity  we believe that the presentation of covenant ebitda provides investors with important information

potential future financings in addition to our previous financing activities  we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or a capital markets transaction  possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity 
given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions  access to the capital markets cannot be assured 
our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
however  a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt 
dividends under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing  additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment  and certain financial tests are satisfied 

table of contents asset acquisitions and dispositions in march  we acquired an additional ownership of tc debica sa  our tire manufacturing subsidiary in poland  by purchasing outstanding shares held by minority shareholders for million 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded goodwill totaling million 
we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to procure from our board of directors  between march and august  the approval to announce a tender offer for the remaining outstanding shares of that subsidiary that we do not already own  provided that such tender offer can be accomplished without the use of substantial cash financing from goodyear 
we also have agreed to facilitate the expansion of the daily commercial truck tire production capacity in debica 
in october  we acquired the remaining ownership interest in goodyear dalian tire company ltd  our tire manufacturing and distribution subsidiary in china 
the amount of our additional investment and the impact on our results of operations and financial position were not material 
given tightening credit markets and difficult economic conditions in certain of our major markets that have led to lower customer demand  we are deferring certain capital investments until circumstances improve 
we now expect capital investments of between million and million in the restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses  and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions

table of contents the obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of december  although subject to change  the amounts set forth in the table for the st year  the nd year and the rd year represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for domestic defined benefit pension plans under current erisa law  reflecting the current funding relief provisions of the worker  retiree and employer recovery act of  and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non us pension plans  plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non us pension plans 
for years after  the amounts shown in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for our domestic defined benefit pension plans  plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non us pension plans  and do not include estimates for contributions to our funded non us pension plans 
the expected contributions for our domestic plans are based upon a number of assumptions  including projected target liability interest rate of for through  and plan asset returns of for and beyond 
future contributions are also affected by other factors such as future interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions  and any changes to current law which would grant additional funding relief for defined benefit plan sponsors 
the payments presented above are expected payments for the next years 
the payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect 
under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans 
the obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis 
the estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims 
the present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is million 
binding commitments are for raw materials and investments in land  buildings and equipment 
these amounts represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of december  we have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters 
additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities  environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities 
these other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature 
we cannot  with any degree of reliability  determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled 
accordingly  these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table 
in addition  the following contingent contractual obligations  the amounts of which cannot be estimated  are not included in the table above the terms and conditions of our global alliance with sri  as set forth in the umbrella agreement between sri and us  provide for certain minority exit rights available to sri commencing in in addition  the occurrence of certain other events enumerated in the umbrella agreement  including certain bankruptcy events or changes in our control  could trigger a right of sri to require us to purchase their interests in the global alliance immediately 
sri s exit rights  in the event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of sri s exit rights  could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sri s interests in the global alliance following the determination of the fair value of sri s interest 
the umbrella agreement provides that the payment amount would be based on the fair value of sri s minority shareholder s interest in each of gdte and gdtna and the book value of net assets of the japanese joint ventures 
the payment amount would be determined through a negotiation process where  if no mutually agreed amount was determined  a binding arbitration process would determine that amount

description of goodyear s business global alliance 
pursuant to certain long term agreements  we will purchase minimum amounts of various raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments  or in quantities that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our production levels 
we do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts 
we generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term  intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
we may  however  from time to time  enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets  undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments  or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber  synthetic rubber  carbon black  fabrics  steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities 
approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives  whose cost may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 
we currently do not hedge commodity prices 
we do  however  use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials  including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power and expand our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials 
interest rate risk we continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix 
within defined limitations  we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
we will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates  and are normally designated as cash flow hedges 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates  and are normally designated as fair value hedges 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions 
at december   of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging compared to at an average rate of at december  we also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances 
we may also enter into interest rate contracts that change the basis of our floating interest rate exposure 
there was one such interest rate contract outstanding at december  in october  we entered into a basis swap with a counterparty under which we pay six month libor and receive one month libor plus a premium 
this swap applies to billion of notional principal and matures in october during  the weighted average interest rates paid and received were and  respectively 
fair value gains and losses on this basis swap are recorded in other income and expense 
the fair value of this swap at december  was a liability of million 
there were no interest rate swap contracts at december  during  our weighted average interest rate swap contract notional principal amount was million  libor based payments averaged and fixed rate receipts averaged 
the following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt  excluding capital leases  at december in millions carrying amount liability fair value liability pro forma fair value liability the pro forma information assumes a basis point decrease in market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption 
the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models 
foreign currency exchange risk we enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales 
contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation 

table of contents the following table presents foreign currency forward contract information at december in millions fair value asset liability pro forma decrease in fair value contract maturities the pro forma change in fair value assumes a adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption 
the sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models 
fair values are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at december as follows in millions asset liability current asset long term asset current liability the counterparties to our interest rate and foreign exchange contracts were substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks or other financial institutions that are recognized market makers 
we control our credit exposure by diversifying across multiple counterparties and by setting counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of counterparty credit risk such as credit default swap spreads 
we also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible 
based on our analysis  we consider the risk of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts to be remote 
however  the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its obligations when due could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity in the period in which it occurs
