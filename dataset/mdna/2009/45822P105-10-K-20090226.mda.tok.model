natural gas supply integrys energy group s natural gas utilities manage portfolios of natural gas supply contracts  storage services  and pipeline transportation services designed to meet their varying load patterns at the lowest reasonable cost 
integrys energy group s regulated natural gas subsidiaries contract for fixed term firm natural gas supplies with various natural gas suppliers each year to meet the november through march winter period demand of firm system sales customers 
integrys energy group s regulated natural gas supply requirements are met through a combination of physical fixed price purchases  storage contracted and owned  natural gas call options and physical index price purchases  and through the purchase of additional natural gas supplies on the monthly spot market through fixed term firm contracts to supplement natural gas supplies and minimize risk 
during periods of colder than normal weather  purchasing natural gas in the daily spot market may be necessary 
integrys energy group s natural gas utilities contract with various underground storage facilities for underground natural gas storage capacity and have company owned storage 
besides providing the ability to manage significant changes in daily natural gas demand  storage also provides integrys energy group with the ability to purchase steady levels of natural gas on a year round basis  thus lowering supply cost volatility

design peak day demand for wps and merc is associated with firm system sales customers only 
design peak day demand for wps includes dekatherms per day of peak day back up service 
regulatory matters legislation and regulation at state level the natural gas retail rates of integrys energy group are regulated by the icc  pscw  mpsc  and mpuc 
under current regulatory practice  the icc  pscw  mpuc  and mpsc allow integrys energy group s regulated natural gas utilities to pass the prudently incurred cost of natural gas on to customers on a one for one basis through purchased gas adjustment clauses 
changes in the cost of natural gas are reflected in both natural gas revenues and natural gas purchases  thus having little or no impact on net income 
effective march   pgl and nsg received approval from the icc for a four year pilot program of a vba decoupling mechanism that mitigates the impact of variations in weather from normal conditions and mitigates the impact of customer conservation 
the vba decoupling mechanism allows pgl and nsg to adjust rates going forward to recover or refund the difference between the actual and authorized margin impact of variations in volumes 
see note  regulatory environment  for further discussion of the pgl and nsg rate case and vba decoupling mechanism 
effective january   wps received approval from the pscw for a four year pilot program of a decoupling mechanism  which will allow wps to adjust rates to recover or refund the difference between the actual and authorized margin impacts of variations in volumes 
the pscw approved this decoupling mechanism  with certain conditions  in the wps rate case order 
see note  regulatory environment  for further discussion of the wps rate case and the decoupling mechanism 
all of integrys energy group s utility subsidiaries are required to provide service and grant credit to customers within their service territories 
the utilities are generally precluded from discontinuing service to residential customers during winter moratorium months 
legislation and regulation at federal level most of the natural gas distributed by integrys energy group is transported to its distribution systems by interstate pipelines 
the pipelines services transportation and storage are regulated by the ferc under the natural gas act and the natural gas policy act of see natural gas supply section above 
under united states department of transportation regulations  the state commissions are responsible for monitoring the regulated natural gas utilities safety compliance program for its pipelines under code of federal regulations cfr part transportation of natural and other gas by pipeline minimum federal safety standards and cfr part transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline 
pgl utilizes its storage and transmission assets as a natural gas hub 
this activity is regulated by the ferc and consists of providing wholesale transportation and storage services in interstate commerce 
for additional information  see note  regulatory environment 
other matters seasonality the natural gas throughput of integrys energy group s regulated natural gas utilities follows a seasonal pattern because the heating requirements of customers are temperature driven 
specifically  customers typically use more natural gas during the winter months 
during  the regulated natural gas utility segment recorded approximately of its revenues from january through march and november through december 
competition integrys energy group s regulated natural gas utility operations face competition with other entities and forms of energy in varying degrees  particularly for large commercial and industrial customers who have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels 
due to the volatility of natural gas prices  integrys energy group has seen customers with dual fuel capability switch to alternate fuels for short periods of time  then switch back to natural gas as market rates change 
interruptible natural gas sales and natural gas transportation service is offered for customers to enable them to reduce their energy costs 
transportation customers purchase their natural gas directly from third party natural gas suppliers and contract with one of integrys energy group s natural gas utility entities to transport the natural gas from pipelines to their facilities 
these purchases have little effect on net income because these transportation services provide margins similar to those applicable to conventional natural gas sales 
additionally  some customers still purchase their natural gas commodity directly from one of integrys energy group s natural gas utility entities but have elected to do so on an interruptible basis  as a means to reduce their costs 
customers continue to switch between firm system supply  interruptible system supply  and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change 
working capital requirements the seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from january through june 
a portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from april through november 
in addition  planned capital spending on the natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in april through november 
because of these timing differences  the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short term borrowings during the late summer and fall 
short term debt is typically reduced over the january through june period 
c 
regulated electric utility operations integrys energy group s regulated electric utility operations are provided through wps and uppco 
wps s regulated electric operations generate and distribute electric energy mainly to northeastern wisconsin and a small portion of michigan s upper peninsula 
uppco provides electric energy in michigan s upper peninsula 
wholesale electric service is provided to various customers  including municipal utilities  electric cooperatives  energy marketers  other investor owned utilities  and municipal joint action agencies 
both wps and uppco are members of miso  a ferc approved  independent  non profit organization  which operates a financial and physical electric wholesale market in the midwest 
wps and uppco offer their generation and bid their customer load into the miso market 
miso evaluates wps s  uppco s  and other market participants energy injections into  and withdrawals from  the system to economically dispatch the miso system 
miso settles the participants offers and bids based on locational marginal prices  which are market driven values based on the specific time and location of the purchase and or sale of energy 
regulated electric utility segment operating statistics operating revenues millions residential commercial and industrial wholesale and other total kilowatt hour sales millions residential commercial and industrial wholesale and other total customers served approximate  end of period residential commercial and industrial wholesale and other total in  wps reached a firm net design peak of  megawatts on july as a result of continually reaching demand peaks in the summer months  primarily due to air conditioning load  the summer period is the most relevant for wps s regulated electric utility capacity 
wps expects future supply reserves to meet the minimum planning reserve margin criteria through as required by the pscw 
the pscw requires wps to maintain a planning reserve margin above its projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to its customers 
in october  the pscw issued a written order to lower the reserve margin requirement from to for long term planning planning years two through ten 
the pscw also determined that the short term planning planning year one reserve margin for wisconsin utilities will follow the planning reserve margin established by miso under module e of its open access transmission and energy markets tariff 
in  uppco reached a firm net design peak of megawatts on december the mpsc has not established minimum guidelines for future supply reserves 
wps and uppco had adequate capacity to meet all firm electric load obligations during and expect to have adequate capacity to meet all obligations during facilities for a complete listing of integrys energy group s regulated electric facilities  see item  properties  in this annual report on form k

electric supply electric supply mix the sources of integrys energy group s regulated electric supply were as follows energy source company owned generating plants coal hydroelectric natural gas and fuel oil wind total company owned generating plants purchased power nuclear kewaunee power station natural gas fox energy center  llc and combined locks energy center  llc hydroelectric other including miso total purchased power fuel costs the cost of fuel per generation of one million british thermal units btus was as follows fuel type coal natural gas fuel oil coal supply coal is the primary fuel source for wps s regulated electric generation facilities  the majority of which is purchased from the powder river basin mines located in wyoming 
this low sulfur coal has been wps s lowest cost coal source from any of the subbituminous coal producing regions in the united states 
wps s regulated electric fuel portfolio strategy is to maintain a to day supply of coal at each plant site 
historically  wps has purchased coal directly from the producer for its wholly owned plants 
wisconsin power and light purchases coal for the jointly owned edgewater and columbia plants and is reimbursed by wps for its share of the coal costs 
at december   wps had coal transportation contracts in place for of its coal transportation requirements 
for more information on coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract  see note  commitments and contingencies 
natural gas supply generation wps supplies natural gas through its natural gas distribution system to its approximately megawatts of natural gas fired combustion turbine generation facilities 
in addition  wps is committed through a power purchase agreement to provide fuel for megawatts of the fox energy center  a natural gas fired combined cycle generation facility owned by a third party with a total combined electric capacity of approximately megawatts 
for more information on natural gas supply under contract  see note  commitments and contingencies 
in december  wps received approval from the pscw to continue its energy market risk management plan to govern its activities in the energy markets 
the order extends wps s authority to engage in activities to limit exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices affecting its electric generation  as well as to use financial transmission rights to manage energy congestion costs 
the plan provides for the use of financial futures contracts for natural gas and the use of financial options that cap the price of natural gas for a portion of wps s forecasted natural gas fuel generation requirements and natural gas price sensitive purchased power contracts 
power purchase agreements integrys energy group s regulated electric facilities enter into short term and long term power purchase agreements to meet a portion of electric energy supply needs 
the most significant of these is an agreement through with dominion energy kewaunee  llc to purchase energy and capacity from the kewaunee power station consistent with volumes available when wps owned the facility 
for more information on power purchase obligations  see note  commitments and contingencies 
regulatory matters integrys energy group s electric utility operations are regulated by the pscw  mpsc  and ferc 
wps s retail electric rates are regulated by the pscw and mpsc  and uppco s retail electric rates are regulated by the mpsc 
the ferc regulates wholesale electric rates for wps and uppco 
in  retail electric revenues accounted for of total electric revenues  while wholesale electric revenues accounted for of total electric revenues 
the pscw sets rates through its ratemaking process  which is based upon recovery of operating costs and a return on invested capital 
one of the cost recovery components is fuel and purchased power  which is governed by a fuel window mechanism 
under the fuel window  if actual fuel and purchased power costs deviate by more than from costs included in the rates charged to customers  a rate review can be triggered 
once a rate review is triggered  rates may be reset subject to pscw approval for the remainder of the year to recover or refund  on an annualized basis  the projected increase or decrease in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
the mpsc and ferc ratemaking processes are similar to those of the pscw  with the exception of fuel and purchased power  which are recovered on a one for one basis 
effective january   wps received approval from the pscw for a four year pilot program of a decoupling mechanism  which will allow wps to adjust rates to recover or refund the difference between the actual and authorized margin impacts of variations in volumes 
the pscw approved this decoupling mechanism  with certain conditions  in the wps rate case order 
see note  regulatory environment  for further discussion of the wps rate case and the decoupling mechanism 
for additional information  see note  regulatory environment 
hydroelectric licenses wps  uppco  and wrpc a company in which wps has ownership  have long term licenses from ferc for all of their hydroelectric facilities 
in  uppco decided to restore silver lake as a reservoir to support power generation  pending approval of an economically feasible design by the ferc 
in november  the construction phase at silver lake was completed and approved by the ferc 
the project will be completed after the ferc approves the refill plan and the reservoir regains historical water levels 
for more information on silver lake  see note  commitments and contingencies 
other matters seasonality integrys energy group s regulated electric utility sales in wisconsin generally follow a seasonal pattern due to the air conditioning requirements of customers that are primarily impacted by the variability of summer temperatures 
regulated electric utility sales in michigan follow no significant seasonal trend due to cooler climate conditions in the upper peninsula of michigan 
generally  during the winter months  the purchase price of fuel natural gas and fuel oil for generation is heavily influenced by weather and the availability of baseload generation units within the miso energy market 
sustained colder than normal weather and unexpected extended generation outages can influence fuel supply and demand  impacting the production costs at integrys energy group s natural gas and oil fired facilities  as well as natural gas supply commitments under power purchase agreements 
for integrys energy group s regulated electric utility segment  the impact on utility production costs is managed through wps s energy market risk management plan 
competition the retail electric utility market in wisconsin is regulated by the pscw 
retail electric customers currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier 
however  in order to increase sales  utilities work to attract new commercial and industrial customers into their service territory 
as a result  there is competition among utilities to keep energy rates low 
wisconsin utilities have continued to refine regulated tariffs in order to provide the true cost of electric energy to each class of customer by reducing or eliminating rate subsidies among different ratepayer classes 
although wisconsin electric energy markets are regulated  utilities still face competition from other energy sources  such as self generation by large industrial customers and alternative energy sources 
michigan electric energy markets are open to competition  however  an active competitive market has not yet developed in the upper peninsula of michigan  primarily due to a lack of excess generation and transmission system capacity

integrys energy services focuses on effective economic dispatch and risk management strategies in order to enhance the returns of its generation facilities 
a possible disposition of these assets is under consideration based on integrys energy group implementing its strategic decision to either divest of this business segment or significantly reduce its size 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction  for a discussion of the revised strategy for integrys energy services going forward 
renewable energy in response to customers growing interest in sustainability and integrys energy group s own concern for the environment  integrys energy services is now focusing on delivering value added energy services and renewable commodities to its wholesale and retail customers 
new product offerings include renewable energy certificates  energy efficiency programs that promote conservation  and development of green power generation projects 
integrys energy services initially showed its commitment to a greener environment by developing the winnebago energy center in the megawatt plant captures methane gas produced by decomposing trash at a landfill  and the gas powers generators producing enough electricity to power about  homes while offering the potential to save nearly  barrels of oil a year 
in  integrys energy services continued its development of renewable energy products and focus on conservation by investing approximately million in solar projects located throughout the united states for a total capacity of megawatts 
integrys energy services business model offers clients solar generated electric power without the need for any customer capital investment 
customers agree to purchase all the solar power produced at a price generally less than their current retail rate 
these solar investments receive substantial tax benefits  including the investment tax credit and accelerated tax depreciation 
these projects may also benefit from attractive state incentive programs including rebates or solar renewable energy certificates 
in  integrys energy services  through its partially owned subsidiary  lgs renewables i  lc  expects to complete construction of a pipeline  which will transport methane gas produced at a landfill for use at a chemical plant as a replacement for natural gas 
as of december   integrys energy services investment in construction was approximately million 
for a complete listing of energy producing facilities of integrys energy services  see item  properties 
fuel supply for generation facilities integrys energy services fuel inventory policy varies for each generation facility depending on the type of fuel used and available natural gas storage facilities 
in  integrys energy services merchant coal fired generation facilities consisted of its westwood and stoneman facilities until the stoneman facility was sold in july actual fuel needs in will depend on market conditions and operational capability of the westwood facility 
integrys energy services westwood facility burns waste coal left behind by mining operations and has several year s supply on site 
all fuel is located within a seven mile radius of the plant 
energy supply physical supply obligations are created when integrys energy services wholesale and retail marketing groups execute forward sales contracts which may have fixed or variable volumes  or a combination thereof 
additionally  contracts may have fixed or variable pricing components 
whenever possible  any price risk is mitigated at the time the commitment is executed with the customer 
smaller contracts may remain open for short periods of time until a hedgeable volume has been sold 
integrys energy services electricity and natural gas supply requirements are primarily met through the procurement of natural gas and electricity in the wholesale markets 
only a small portion of its electricity supply requirements are met through owned generation 
integrys energy services does not own any reserves  so all natural gas supply is procured from producers and other suppliers in the wholesale markets 
retail electricity the majority of integrys energy services obligations to provide physical electricity results from retail sales to commercial and industrial customers  many of which are full requirements in nature 
integrys energy services uses a combination of bilateral electricity purchase agreements from generation companies and other marketers as well as regional power pools to meet those obligations 
integrys energy services employs load forecasting models populated with historical usage data and current weather and production assumptions to estimate the amount of electric supply to be acquired 
day to day shortfalls or overages are balanced out in the day ahead and real time markets 
wholesale electricity wholesale supply obligations primarily result from the activities of integrys energy services electric origination operation 
sales to energy intermediaries such as local distribution companies ldcs  municipalities  aggregators  and marketers require integrys energy services to procure electric supply for fixed and variable volume contracts 
supply is acquired directly from merchant generation companies  electric utilities  marketers  and regional power pools 
some of integrys energy services supply contracts are unit contingent  which means that electricity is only provided to the extent that a specific generator is operational 
integrys energy services attempts to match unit contingent sales and supply contracts in order to reduce the risk of supply disruptions 
retail natural gas physical natural gas supply obligations are created by the execution of forward sales contracts by integrys energy services retail marketing operation 
commercial and industrial customers  as well as some residential customers  make up the majority of its load requirements 
natural gas is sourced in the wholesale markets at the load zone  or in some cases is transported to the load zone using natural gas transportation contracts 
floating volume contracts are aggregated and modeled in order to estimate the load requirements taking into consideration the potential impact of weather and operational variability of the customer 
integrys energy services balances the differences between the actual sales demand or usage of customers and its block purchases by buying and selling any shortfall or excess in the spot market 
many of integrys energy services customers are also allotted storage capacity from their ldcs which integrys energy services utilizes to manage daily load variability 
wholesale natural gas integrys energy services wholesale natural gas operation acquires physical supply as part of its asset optimization and trading program 
when integrys energy services signs sales contracts with wholesale origination customers such as utilities and other marketing companies  it hedges the majority of the price risk using financial contracts such as nymex futures and over the counter nymex swaps 
the physical supply is acquired from producers or other suppliers at the load zone or is transported into the load zone using natural gas transportation contracts 
integrys energy services also contracts to store the natural gas it purchases in lower priced periods for sale in higher priced future periods 
the usage and optimization of transportation and storage contracts ultimately results in more reliable and lower cost supply

other matters customer segmentation as of december   integrys energy services was delivering electricity and natural gas supply to customers in states in the united states and provinces in canada 
integrys energy services periodically reviews and evaluates the profitability of its operations in each of these markets 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction  for a discussion of the revised strategy for integrys energy services going forward 
as of december   integrys energy services served electricity customers within states in the united states and canadian provinces  including its largest markets in illinois  texas  and the northeastern united states 
integrys energy services served natural gas customers within states in the united states and canadian provinces  including its largest markets in illinois  wisconsin  michigan  ohio  and canada 
although integrys energy services is not dependent on any one customer  a significant percentage of its retail sales volume is derived from industries related to paper and allied products  food and kindred products  chemicals and paint  steel and foundries  and ethanol production facilities 
seasonality integrys energy services believes that its business  in the aggregate  is not seasonal  even though certain products sell more heavily in some seasons than in others 
sales of natural gas generally peak in the winter months  while sales of electricity generally peak in the summer months 
generally in the summer months  the demand for electricity is high  which increases the price at which electricity can be sold 
in periods of high residential fuel consumption generally the winter months  the purchase price of oil and natural gas increases  which increases the production costs at integrys energy services natural gas and oil fired generation facilities 
integrys energy services business can be volatile as a result of market conditions and the related market opportunities available to its customers 
competition integrys energy services is a nonregulated energy marketer that competes against regulated utilities  energy marketers  and energy trading companies 
integrys energy services competes with other energy providers on the basis of price  reliability  customer service  product offerings  financial strength  consumer convenience  performance  and reputation 
the competitive landscape differs in each service area and within each targeted customer segment 
for residential and small commercial customers  the primary competitive challenges come from the incumbent utility and affiliated utility marketing companies 
the large commercial  institutional and industrial segments are very competitive in most markets with nearly all natural gas customers having already switched away from utilities to an alternative provider 
national affiliated marketers  energy producers and other independent retail energy companies compete for customers in this segment 
the incumbent regulated utilities and the nationally branded utility affiliates typically benefit from the economies of scale derived from the strength of substantial asset based balance sheets  and vertically integrated business models that combine production  transmission  and distribution assets 
these advantages are offset by the lack of flexibility to offer multiple product choices to their customers  while the nationally branded utility affiliates struggle with long term focus and cultural adaptation to a nonregulated market environment 
the local utilities have the advantage of long standing relationships with their customers  and they have longer operating histories  greater financial and other resources  and greater name recognition in their markets than integrys energy services does 
in addition  local utilities have been subject to many years of regulatory oversight and thus have a significant amount of experience regarding the policy preferences of their regulators 
local utilities may seek to decrease their tariff retail rates to limit or preclude the opportunities for competitive energy suppliers and may seek to establish rates  terms  and conditions to the disadvantage of competitive energy suppliers 
working capital the working capital needs of integrys energy services vary significantly over time due to volatility in commodity prices  and related margin calls  levels of natural gas inventories  the structure of wholesale transactions  and the price of energy for natural gas and electricity 
integrys energy services working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations  equity infusions  and debt both long term and short term 
integrys energy services has access to its own credit line up to million from independent financial institutions  and has the ability to borrow up to million through an intercompany loan agreement with integrys energy group 
at december   integrys energy group was authorized to provide aggregate guarantees for integrys energy services commodity and financial transactions up to billion which includes guarantees on the million credit line 
these guarantees provide the credit support needed to participate in the nonregulated energy market 
the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility  uncertainty  and disruption in  which has continued into the strength and depth of competition in the nonregulated energy markets depends heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties  which could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets 
reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the nonregulated energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of those markets  which are important to the business of integrys energy services

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  when making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones integrys energy group faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that integrys energy group currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect integrys energy group 
adverse capital and credit market conditions could negatively affect integrys energy group s ability to meet liquidity needs  access capital  and or grow or sustain its current businesses 
cost of capital and disruptions  uncertainty  and or volatility in the financial markets could also adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of integrys energy group  as well as exert downward pressure on its stock price 
the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility  uncertainty  and disruption in  which has continued into having access to the credit and capital markets  at a reasonable cost  is necessary for integrys energy group to fund its operations  including capital requirements 
the capital and credit markets provide integrys energy group with liquidity to operate and grow its businesses that is not otherwise provided from operating cash flows 
the credit and capital markets also support the ability of integrys energy group to provide credit support for the nonregulated operations of integrys energy services 
disruptions  uncertainty  and or volatility in those markets could increase integrys energy group s cost of capital 
if integrys energy group or its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable  they may have to delay raising capital  issue shorter term securities  and or bear an increased cost of capital 
this  in turn  could impact integrys energy group s ability to grow or sustain its current businesses including its ability to provide adequate credit support for integrys energy services  cause a reduction in earnings  and or limit integrys energy group s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level 
the strength and depth of competition in the nonregulated energy markets depends heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties  which was adversely affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets in and could continue to be affected in reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the nonregulated energy markets have diminished the liquidity and competitiveness of those markets and could continue to do so into  which could negatively impact the business of integrys energy services 
these diminished markets have also increased counterparty credit risk 
a reduction in integrys energy group s or its subsidiaries credit ratings could materially and adversely affect their business  financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
integrys energy group cannot be sure that any of integrys energy group s or its subsidiaries credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if  in the rating agency s judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any downgrade could require the payment of higher interest rates in future financings and possibly reduce the potential pool of creditors  increase borrowing costs under certain existing credit facilities  limit access to the commercial paper market  limit the availability of adequate credit support for integrys energy services operations  and require provision of additional credit assurance  including cash margin calls  to contract counterparties 
the failure to effectively execute integrys energy group s plan to significantly reduce the scope and scale  partially divest of  or fully divest of the nonregulated energy services business segment  integrys energy services  could negatively impact the future results of operations and financial condition of integrys energy group 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to execute our strategic decision for our nonregulated business segment in a timely manner 
the process of selling assets or the full business segment  exiting markets  reducing operating costs  and managing exposures can result in increased risks  including but not limited to a reduction in operating efficiencies  as operating margins may decline at a faster rate than the associated operating expenses  potential loss of key employees during periods of increased employment uncertainty  a reduction in the value of the nonregulated business segment  including a potential corresponding negative impact on integrys energy group  lower customer retention rates at integrys energy services due to short term uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of the strategic decision  losses on the disposition of specific assets  components of the business segment  or the entire business segment during this period of economic turmoil  lower earnings capacity from this business segment going forward  which integrys energy group may not be able to replace 
refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction  for a further discussion of the revised strategy for integrys energy services 
counterparties and customers may not meet their obligations 
integrys energy group is exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe integrys energy group money  energy  natural gas  coal or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations 
should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  integrys energy group might be forced to replace or to sell the underlying commitment at then current market prices 
in such event  integrys energy group might incur losses  or its results of operations  financial position  or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 
some of integrys energy group s customers are experiencing  or may experience  financial problems that could have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 
integrys energy group cannot provide assurance that its financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to integrys energy group and that such a default will not have a material adverse effect on integrys energy group s business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
furthermore  the bankruptcy of one or more of its customers  or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint  might make it unlikely that integrys energy group would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by distressed entities or residential customers 
such events could adversely impact integrys energy group s receivable collections and additional allowances may be required  which could adversely affect its operating results 
in addition  such events might force customers to reduce or curtail their future use of integrys energy group s products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on integrys energy group s results of operations and financial condition 
the use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints 
integrys energy group uses derivative instruments  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  to manage its commodity and financial market risks 
integrys energy group also purchases and sells commodity based contracts in the natural gas and electric energy markets for trading purposes 
integrys energy group has in the past  and could in the future  recognize financial losses on both an economic and gaap basis on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
additionally  significant volatility in energy prices could adversely impact integrys energy group s cash collateral requirements due to counterparty margin calls 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of derivative contracts involves management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
furthermore  realized values could differ from values determined by management 
for additional information concerning derivatives and commodity based trading contracts  see note  risk management activities 
integrys energy group has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results 
the merger with pec and the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in minnesota and michigan are accounted for as purchases by integrys energy group in accordance with gaap 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition and added to those of integrys energy group 
as a result of the application of purchase accounting  these transactions resulted in a significant amount of goodwill 
to the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired  integrys energy group may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment 
such an impairment charge could have a material impact on the financial results of integrys energy group 
integrys energy group is subject to changes in government regulation  which may have a negative impact on its businesses  financial position  and results of operations 
the rates that integrys energy group s regulated utilities are allowed to charge for their retail and wholesale services are some of the most important items influencing its business  financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
integrys energy group is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state regulatory agencies  which significantly influences its operating environment and may affect integrys energy group s ability to recover costs from utility customers 
in particular  the pscw  icc  mpsc  mpuc  ferc  sec  epa  minnesota office of pipeline safety  united states department of transportation  wdnr  and illinois environmental protection agency regulate many aspects of integrys energy group s utility operations  including  but not limited to  construction of facilities  conditions of service  the issuance of securities  and the rates that it can charge customers 
integrys energy group is required to have numerous permits  approvals  and certificates from these agencies to operate its business 
existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted by these agencies or these agencies may adopt new laws and regulations that apply to integrys energy group 
integrys energy group is unable to predict the impact on its businesses and operating results of any such actions by these agencies 
however  changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require integrys energy group to incur additional expenses or change business operations  which may have an adverse impact on results of operations 
in addition  federal regulatory reforms may produce unexpected changes and costs in the public utility industry 
any change in integrys energy group s ability to sell electricity generated from its facilities at market based rates may impact earnings 
the ferc has authorized integrys energy group to sell generation from certain of its facilities at market prices 
the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw integrys energy group s market based rate authority 
if the ferc determines that the market is not workably competitive  that integrys energy group possesses market power  or that it is not charging just and reasonable rates  it may require its subsidiaries to sell power at a price based upon the costs incurred in producing the power 
integrys energy group s revenues and profit margins may be negatively affected by any reduction by the ferc of the rates it may receive 
integrys energy group may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions 
climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas emissions  most notably carbon dioxide  are increasingly becoming a concern for the energy industry 
while there is currently no federal regulation in the united states that mandates the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions  it is possible that such legislation may be enacted in the future 
to that end  federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases 
until legislation is passed at the federal or state level  it remains unclear as to which industry sectors will be impacted  when compliance will be required  the magnitude of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions that will be required  and the costs and opportunities associated with compliance 
integrys energy group is evaluating both the technical and cost implications which may result from future state  regional  or federal greenhouse gas regulatory programs  but at this time  it is uncertain as to the effect climate change regulation may have on integrys energy group s future operations  capital expenditures  and financial results 
based on the complexity and uncertainty of these issues  it is possible that future carbon regulation will increase the cost of electricity produced at coal fired generation units and may affect the capital expenditures integrys energy group would make at its generation units 
at this time  there is no commercially available technology for removing carbon dioxide from a pulverized coal fired plant 
in addition  future legislation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could make some of the generating units uneconomic to maintain or operate and could affect future results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition if such costs are not recoverable through regulated rates 
integrys energy group s natural gas delivery systems may also generate fugitive gas as a result of normal operations and as a result of excavation  construction  and repair of natural gas delivery systems 
fugitive gas typically vents to the atmosphere and consists primarily of methane  a greenhouse gas 
costs of environmental compliance  liabilities  fines  penalties  and litigation could exceed integrys energy group s estimates 
compliance with current and future federal and state environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital  operating and other costs  including remediation and containment expenses and monitoring obligations 
integrys energy group cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up and compliance costs and the possibility that changes will be made to the current environmental laws and regulations 
integrys energy group s natural gas utility subsidiaries are accruing liabilities and deferring costs recorded as regulatory assets incurred in connection with their former manufactured gas plant sites  including related legal expenses  pending recovery through rates or from other entities 
regulatory assets reflect the net amount of costs incurred to date  carrying costs excluding those for wps  amounts recovered from insurance companies  other entities and customers  and management s best estimates of the costs integrys energy group will spend in the future for investigating and remediating the manufactured gas plant sites 
integrys energy group believes that any of these costs that are not recoverable from other entities or from insurance carriers are recoverable through rates for utility services under approved mechanisms for the recovery of prudently incurred costs 
a change in these rate recovery mechanisms  however  or a decision by the applicable state commission that some or all of these costs were not prudently incurred  could result in the present recognition as expense of some or all of these costs 
for more information  see note  commitments and contingencies 
in addition  impacts resulting from future federal or state regulation regarding mercury  sulfur dioxide  and nitrogen oxide emissions are uncertain 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
citizen groups that feel there are compliance issues not sufficiently enforced by environmental regulatory agencies may also bring citizen enforcement actions against integrys energy group 
such actions could seek penalties  injunctive relief  and costs of litigation 
poor investment performance of retirement plan investments and other factors impacting retirement plan costs could unfavorably impact integrys energy group s liquidity and results of operations 
integrys energy group has employee benefit plans that cover substantially all of its employees and retirees 
integrys energy group s cost of providing these benefit plans is dependent upon actual plan experience and assumptions concerning the future  such as earnings on and or valuations of plan assets  discount rates  the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans  future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions to the plans 
depending upon the investment performance over time and other factors impacting its costs as listed above  integrys energy group could be required to make larger contributions in the future to fund these plans 
these additional funding obligations could have a material adverse impact on integrys energy group s cash flows  financial condition  and or results of operations 
changes made to the plans may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
fluctuating commodity prices may reduce energy margins 
integrys energy group s regulated natural gas margins are sensitive to changes in natural gas commodity prices 
any changes could affect the prices the regulated natural gas utilities charge  their operating costs  and the competitive position of their products and services 
prudently incurred costs for purchased natural gas and pipeline transportation and storage services are fully recoverable through the annual reconciliation of revenues from the natural gas charge 
however  increases in natural gas costs affect total retail prices and  therefore  the competitive position of integrys energy group s natural gas business relative to other forms of energy 
in addition  the timing and extent of high natural gas prices can adversely affect accounts receivable  bad debts  fuel cost  and interest expense 
integrys energy group is also subject to margin requirements in connection with its use of forward contracts and these requirements could escalate if prices move adversely relative to these positions 
integrys energy group s regulated electric utility margins are directly affected by commodity costs related to coal  natural gas  and other fuels used in the electric generation process 
integrys energy group may experience increased expenses  including interest costs and bad debts  higher working capital requirements  and possibly reduction in demand as a result of any increase in the cost of fuel or purchased power 
higher commodity prices result in increased energy prices that may impact customer demand for energy in the nonregulated market and increase counterparty and bad debt risk 
this may stress margins at integrys energy group s nonregulated subsidiaries 
if market prices for electric energy decline below the cost of production at integrys energy group s nonregulated facilities  these units may be temporarily shut down 
integrys energy group s operations are subject to risks beyond our control  including but not limited to weather  terrorist attacks  or acts of war 
integrys energy group s revenues are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas 
that demand can vary greatly based upon weather conditions  seasonality  and temperature extremes  fluctuations in economic activity and growth in integrys energy group s regulated service areas  as well as areas in which its nonregulated subsidiaries operate  and the amount of additional energy available from current or new competitors 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities 
in addition  the cost of repairing damage to integrys energy group s facilities due to storms  natural disasters  wars  terrorist acts and other catastrophic events  that is in excess of insurance limits established for such repairs or excluded by insurance policies  may adversely impact integrys energy group s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist activity and the high cost or potential unavailability of insurance to cover such terrorist activity may impact integrys energy group s results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways 
these actions could also result in disruptions of power and fuel markets 
in addition  integrys energy group s natural gas distribution system and pipelines could be directly or indirectly harmed by future terrorist activity 
actual results could differ from estimates used to prepare integrys energy group s financial statements 
in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates 
for more information about significant estimates and assumptions  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
integrys energy group may not be able to utilize tax credit carryforwards 
integrys energy group has significantly reduced its consolidated federal and state income tax liability in the past through tax credits and tax losses available under the applicable tax codes 
integrys energy group has not fully utilized these tax credits and tax losses in its previous tax filings  but expects to prior to their expiration in future filings 
however  integrys energy group may not be able to fully utilize the tax credits and tax losses available as carryforwards if its future federal and state taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit the use of such credits and losses 
in addition  any future disallowance of some or all of those tax credits or tax losses as a result of legislative change or adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions could materially affect integrys energy group s tax obligations 
integrys energy group is subject to provisions that can limit merger and acquisition opportunities for its shareholders 
the wisconsin public utility holding company law precludes the acquisition of or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a wisconsin public utility unless the pscw has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility consumers  investors and the public 
those interests may  to some extent  be mutually exclusive 
this provision and other requirements of the wisconsin public utility holding company law may delay  or reduce the likelihood of  a sale or change of control thus reducing the likelihood that shareholders will receive a takeover premium for their shares 
provisions of integrys energy group s articles of incorporation and by laws may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and may prevent or delay a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving integrys energy group that is not approved by its board of directors  even if the shareholders believe that such events may be beneficial to integrys energy group s interests 
in addition  the wisconsin business corporation law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult attempts by others to obtain control of integrys energy group without the approval of its board of directors

strategic overview integrys energy group s goal is to create long term value for shareholders and customers primarily through growth in its core regulated businesses 
the company has made a decision to either fully or partially divest of its nonregulated energy services business segment  integrys energy services  or reduce its size  risk  and financial requirements in response to increased collateral requirements at a time when global credit and financial markets are constraining the availability and increasing the cost of capital 
in order to create value  integrys energy group focuses on maintaining and growing a strong regulated utility base a strong regulated utility base is necessary to maintain a strong balance sheet  predictable cash flows  a desired risk profile  attractive dividends  and quality credit ratings  which are critical to our success 
integrys energy group believes the following investments have helped  or will help  maintain and grow its regulated utility base the february merger with pec  which added the natural gas distribution operations of pgl and nsg to the regulated utility base of integrys energy group 
our ownership interest in atc  which owned over billion of assets at december  integrys energy group will continue to fund its share of the equity portion of future atc growth 
atc plans to invest billion in the next ten years to ensure that the power grid will continue to meet the needs of its customers 
weston  a megawatt coal fired base load power plant located near wausau  wisconsin  was completed and became operational june  wps holds a ownership interest in the weston power plant 
a proposed accelerated annual investment in natural gas distribution facilities replacement of cast iron mains at pgl 
the investment of approximately million to connect wps s natural gas distribution system to the guardian ii natural gas pipeline to be completed in wps s purchase of a megawatt wind generation project to be constructed in in howard county  iowa 
wps s continued investment in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet the requirements set by environmental regulators 
capital projects to construct and upgrade equipment to meet or exceed required environmental standards are planned each year 
for more detailed information on integrys energy group s capital expenditure program  see liquidity and capital resources  capital requirements 
systematically reduce the size and the capital and liquidity commitments of the nonregulated energy services business segment unprecedented energy price volatility  combined with significant growth in the forward customer business  has increased the collateral requirements of integrys energy services at a time when global credit and financial market conditions are both constraining the availability and increasing the cost of capital 
as a result  integrys energy group has decided to take steps to protect its financial position and liquidity by either fully or partially divesting of its nonregulated energy services business segment or significantly scaling it back 
on an operational level  integrys energy group s short term strategy will be to reduce and refocus its financial  credit  and risk capital on those aspects of integrys energy services business that yield the highest return  with consideration given toward lower risk 
integrys energy services has recently  and as necessary in the future  expects it will continue to adjust pricing strategies to capture margins that are commensurate with its increasing capital costs and collateral requirements 
longer term  in the event that a full divestiture of integrys energy services does not occur and a portion of the nonregulated energy services business segment remains  it will be a smaller segment that requires significantly less capital  parental guarantees  and overall financial liquidity from integrys energy group 
integrys energy group is seeking to deploy its capital to areas with more desirable risk adjusted rates of return 
although integrys energy group anticipates a reduction in future earnings capacity from this business segment going forward  an improvement in the liquidity position and reduced business risk profile of integrys energy group is expected 
integrating resources to provide operational excellence integrys energy group is committed to integrating resources of all its regulated and nonregulated businesses  while meeting all applicable regulatory and legal requirements 
this will provide the best value to customers and shareholders by leveraging the individual capabilities and expertise of each business and lowering costs 
integrys energy group believes the following recent developments have helped  or will help  integrate resources and provide operational excellence the pec merger provides the opportunity to align the best practices and expertise of both companies  which will continue to result in efficiencies by eliminating redundant and overlapping functions and systems 
ibs  a wholly owned service company of integrys energy group  became operational on january  ibs was formed to achieve a significant portion of the cost synergies anticipated from the pec merger through the consolidation and efficient delivery of various support services and to provide more consistent and transparent allocation of costs throughout integrys energy group and its subsidiaries 
operational excellence initiatives were implemented to provide top performance in the areas of project management  process improvement  and contract administration and compliance in order to reduce costs and manage projects and activities within appropriate budgets  schedules  and regulations 
placing strong emphasis on asset and risk management our asset management strategy calls for the continuous assessment of our existing assets  the acquisition of assets  and contractual commitments to obtain resources that complement our existing business and strategy 
the goal is to provide the most efficient use of our resources while maximizing return and maintaining an acceptable risk profile 
this strategy focuses on the disposition of assets  including plants and entire business units  which are no longer strategic to ongoing operations  are not performing as needed  or have an unacceptable risk profile 
we maintain a portfolio approach to risk and earnings 
our decision regarding the future of integrys energy services noted above illustrates our asset management strategy 
our risk management strategy includes the management of market  credit  and operational risk through the course of business 
forward purchases and sales of electric capacity  energy  natural gas  and other commodities allow opportunities to secure prices in a volatile energy market 
each business unit monitors daily oversight of the risk profile related to these instruments consistent with the company s risk management policy 
the corporate risk management group  which reports through the chief financial officer  provides corporate oversight 
results of operations year ended december  millions except per share amounts change in over change in over natural gas utility operations n a electric utility operations nonregulated energy operations n a holding company and other operations n a n a oil and natural gas operations n a income available for common shareholders average basic shares of common stock average diluted shares of common stock basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share earnings summary from to  income available for common shareholders decreased million and diluted earnings per share decreased 
from to  income available for common shareholders increased million and diluted earnings per share decreased 
significant factors impacting the change in earnings and diluted earnings per share were as follows and are discussed in more detail thereafter 
natural gas utility operations earnings improved million in  compared with  primarily due to the following the inclusion of pgl and nsg for all of compared with only a partial year of operations in since they were acquired on february  a rate increase for pgl in february also contributed to the increase in earnings in from to  after tax earnings related to pgl and nsg operations increased million  after including a million after tax goodwill impairment loss related to nsg in an increase in natural gas sales volumes  which drove an approximate million million after tax increase in margin for wps  merc  and mgu 
an interim rate increase for merc  effective october   which had a positive impact on margin 
financial results improved million in  compared with  primarily due to the following financial results for mgu and merc increased million  from a combined net loss of million in  to earnings of million in the positive change in earnings at mgu and merc was driven by the fact that these natural gas utilities operated during the first quarter heating season in  but were not acquired by integrys energy group until after the first quarter heating season 
in addition  mgu and merc incurred a combined million million after tax of transition costs in for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees 
in  mgu and merc were allocated million million after tax of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the pec merger 
regulated natural gas utility earnings at wps increased million  from earnings of million in  to earnings of million in higher earnings were driven by increased volumes due to colder weather during the heating season 
the full year impact of the natural gas rate increase that was effective january   also contributed to the increase 
pgl and nsg  which were acquired effective february   recognized a combined net loss of approximately million in  primarily related to the seasonal nature of natural gas utilities  which derive earnings during the heating season first and fourth quarters 
because of the late february acquisition date  results for the majority of the two coldest months of the year were not included in natural gas utility earnings in the net income for pgl was less than the level we would normally expect  primarily due to increased costs of providing service 
electric utility operations earnings increased million in compared with  resulting primarily from a combined million million after tax decrease in electric maintenance expense and costs to achieve merger synergies related to the pec merger 
an approximate million million after tax increase in margin from wps s retail electric rate increase effective january   and the full benefit of wps s retail electric rate increase effective january  an approximate million million after tax increase in margin driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year 
an approximate million million after tax increase in regulated electric utility margin year over year  driven by fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately million lower than what was recovered in rates during  compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately million higher than what was recovered in rates during the above increases were partially offset by a million million after tax increase in electric transmission expenses primarily related to higher rates charged by miso and atc due to additional transmission costs 
an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million million after tax driven by depreciation related to weston  which was placed in service for accounting purposes in april an approximate million million after tax decrease in margin due to a decline in residential and commercial and industrial sales volumes at wps as a result of cooler weather during the cooling season and customer conservation efforts 
a million million after tax increase in interest expense 
earnings increased million in over  resulting primarily from the following retail electric rate increases at both wps and uppco had a positive year over year impact on operating income 
favorable weather at wps contributed an approximate million million after tax year over year increase in operating income  however  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in weather normalized residential and commercial and industrial customer usage 
fuel and purchased power costs were higher than what was recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were less than what was recovered in rates during the same period in  driving a million million after tax negative variance in operating income 
maintenance expense related to wps s power plants was higher in compared with  driven by an increase in unplanned outages in as well as longer than anticipated planned outages 
nonregulated energy integrys energy services operations financial results decreased million in  compared with  primarily due to the following a million after tax decrease in integrys energy services gaap margin year over year related to non cash activity  of which million was related to non cash activity associated with electric operations  with the remaining million related to non cash activity associated with natural gas operations 
an overview of this non cash activity has been provided below 
non cash electric operations a decline in energy prices during drove an million net after tax non cash loss  compared with a million net after tax non cash gain recognized in  related to an increase in energy prices during the non cash unrealized gains and losses recognized resulted from the application of derivative accounting rules to integrys energy services portfolio of derivative electric customer supply contracts  requiring that these derivative instruments be adjusted to fair market value 
the derivative instruments are utilized to economically hedge the price  volume  and ancillary risks associated with related electric customer sales contracts 
the associated electric customer sales contracts are not adjusted to fair value  as they do not meet the definition of derivative instruments under gaap  creating an accounting mismatch 
as such  the non cash unrealized gains and losses related to the electric customer supply contracts will vary each period  with noncash unrealized gains being recognized in periods of increasing energy prices and non cash unrealized losses being recognized in periods of declining energy prices  and will ultimately reverse when the related customer sales contracts settle 
non cash natural gas operations the spot price of natural gas decreased significantly during the second half of below the average cost of natural gas in inventory which integrys energy services had injected into storage earlier in  which resulted in a lower of cost or market adjustment  as required by gaap 
this adjustment contributed a million year over year decrease in the non cash natural gas margin  driven by non cash inventory write downs in the third and fourth quarters of the negative impact on realized margin related to these inventory adjustments was substantially offset by million of net after tax non cash unrealized gains recognized in  primarily related to derivative instruments utilized to mitigate the price risk on natural gas inventory underlying natural gas storage transactions 
in  natural gas derivative instruments resulted in the recognition of million of net after tax non cash unrealized gains 
similar to the electric operations discussed above  non cash gains and losses related to derivative natural gas sales and customer supply contracts will vary each period  and will ultimately reverse when the physical contracts settle  or when natural gas is withdrawn from inventory 
the recognition of million of after tax earnings from integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel production facility during the year ended december  production and sale of synthetic fuel by integrys energy services ended when section k of the internal revenue code  which provided for section k federal tax credits from the production and sale of synthetic fuel  expired effective december  after tax income from discontinued operations decreased million as a result of the sale of niagara generation in  which was partially offset by a contingent gain that was realized in the fourth quarter of related to the sale of the stoneman generating facility in the third quarter of operating and maintenance expenses at integrys energy services increased million million after tax in compared with  driven by an increase in bad debt expense  broker commissions  a full year of operations from businesses acquired in the pec merger  and employee benefit costs 
partially offsetting the above decreases  the realized retail electric margin increased million million after tax  driven primarily from operations in illinois  due to the addition of new customers as a result of the pec merger  and the reduced impact from purchase accounting in earnings increased million in  compared with  primarily due to the following operating income at integrys energy services increased million million after tax 
after tax income from discontinued operations at integrys energy services increased million  driven by the sale of niagara generation  llc in the first quarter of miscellaneous expense at integrys energy services decreased million million after tax  driven by a decrease in pre tax losses recognized for the period related to integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility 
minority interest income decreased million million after tax as integrys energy services partner elected to stop receiving production from the synthetic fuel facility and  therefore  did not share in losses from this facility in section k federal tax credits recognized from integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility decreased million  from million in  to million in the decrease in section k federal tax credits recognized was driven by the impact of high oil prices on our ability to realize the benefit of section k federal tax credits 
holding company and other operations financial results increased million from to  largely due to higher earnings from our investment in atc  lower interest expense  and lower operating expenses at the holding company  partially offset by the negative year over year impact on operating income related to the reallocation of external costs to achieve merger synergies in in  financial results decreased million  from earnings of million in  to a net loss of million

oil and natural gas operations in connection with the pec merger  integrys energy group announced its intent to divest of pec s oil and natural gas production operations  pep 
pep was sold in the third quarter of in  pep recognized earnings of million  including million of earnings reported as discontinued operations 
the sale of pep resulted in a million after tax gain in in  tax adjustments of million related to the pep sale were recorded as discontinued operations 
earnings per share diluted earnings per share was impacted by a million share increase in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of integrys energy group common stock from to  as well as an increase of million shares in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of integrys energy group s common stock from to integrys energy group issued million shares of common stock on february   in conjunction with the merger with pec  and issued an additional million shares of common stock in may in order to settle its forward equity agreement with an affiliate of jp morgan securities 
additional shares were also issued under the stock investment plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans in and the following discussion provides the analysis of integrys energy group s four segments regulated natural gas utility  regulated electric utility  integrys energy services  and its holding company and other segment 
utility operations in  the utility operations included the regulated natural gas utility segment  consisting of the natural gas operations of pgl  wps  merc  mgu  and nsg 
the regulated natural gas operations of wps  merc  and mgu  were included in results of operations for all of  while the regulated natural gas operations of pgl and nsg were included in results of operations beginning february  through december  the natural gas operations of wps were included for all of  while the natural gas operations of mgu and merc were included from april  through december   and july  through december   respectively 
utility operations also included the regulated electric segment  consisting of the regulated electric operations of wps and uppco for all of   and regulated natural gas utility segment operations year ended december  change in over change in over revenues purchased natural gas costs margins operating and maintenance expense goodwill impairment loss n a depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income taxes operating income miscellaneous income interest expense other expense income before taxes throughput in therms residential commercial and industrial interruptible interdepartmental transport total sales in therms see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for more information 
revenue compared with regulated natural gas utility segment revenue increased million  driven by a combined increase in pgl and nsg natural gas utility revenue of million  from  million during  to  million during the increase in revenue at both of these natural gas utilities was driven primarily by the fact that they were not included in regulated natural gas utility results until after the merger with pec on february  other factors that contributed to this combined increase include pgl s annualized rate increase effective february   which increased revenue year over year by approximately million 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on the pgl and nsg rate cases 
higher year over year natural gas prices 
increases in natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in rates 
colder weather during the heating season  partially offset by energy conservation efforts by natural gas utility customers and a larger number of customer disconnections  which we believe resulted from high energy prices and a general slowdown in the economy 
an increase in natural gas revenue of million at the remaining natural gas utilities wps  merc  and mgu from million during  to  million during  which resulted primarily from a combined million increase in revenue driven by the approximate increase in the per unit cost of natural gas in compared with a million increase in revenue from colder weather during the heating season compared with  evidenced by an approximate year over year increase in heating degree days across these three utilities 
an increase in revenue from merc s interim rate increase  effective october   for retail natural gas customers 
this interim rate increase is subject to refund pending the final rate order  which is expected in the second quarter of see note  regulatory environment  for more information on merc s interim rate increase 
the combined increase in revenue at wps  mgu  and merc  was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue driven by a decrease in year over year volumes normalized for the impact of weather  million of which was driven by a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes sold by wps to its electric utility segment 
the decrease in volumes sold to the electric utility segment was a result of a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its peaking generation units during the summer cooling season because of cooler year over year weather 
in addition  additional electricity was available within the electric utility segment from weston  a coal fired generating facility that became commercially operational in june the remaining decrease in weather normalized volumes was driven by energy conservation efforts of residential customers and a larger number of customer disconnections year over year  which we believe resulted from high energy prices and a general slowdown in the economy 
compared with regulated natural gas utility segment revenue increased  million  driven by the following pgl and nsg acquired february  generated  million of natural gas utility revenue and contributed approximately billion therms of natural gas throughput volumes in merc which acquired natural gas distribution operations in minnesota on july  generated million of natural gas utility revenue and approximately million therms of natural gas throughput volumes in  compared with million of natural gas utility revenue and approximately million therms of natural gas throughput volumes in mgu which acquired natural gas distribution operations in michigan on april  generated million of natural gas utility revenue and approximately million therms of natural gas throughput volumes in  compared with million of natural gas revenue and approximately million therms of natural gas throughput volumes during wps s natural gas utility revenue increased million  from million in  to million in  driven by the following on january   the pscw issued a final written order to wps authorizing a retail natural gas distribution rate increase of million  effective january  see note  regulatory environment  for more information related to the retail natural gas rate increase at wps 
an increase in natural gas throughput volumes 
the increase in natural gas throughput volumes was driven by a increase in residential volumes and a increase in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility 
the increase in sales volumes to residential customers was driven in part by colder year over year weather during the heating season 
the increase in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility was driven by an increase in the need for the electric utility to run its peaking generation units 
natural gas prices were lower on a per unit basis  compared with  resulting in a decrease in natural gas utility revenue  which partially offset the overall increase in natural gas utility revenue at wps 
margin compared with the regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased million  primarily due to an increase in the combined margin at pgl and nsg of million  from million in to million in the increase in combined margin was driven by the acquisition of pgl and nsg on february  the combined operations for the entire heating season were included in the natural gas utility margin 
however  only operations from the merger date through december   were included in the natural gas utility margin 
due to the seasonal nature of natural gas utilities  higher margins are generally derived during the heating season first and fourth quarters 
the rate increase for pgl which resulted in an approximate million increase in margin 
colder than normal weather experienced by both pgl and nsg resulted in an approximate million increase in margin before the decoupling mechanism went into effect on march  an increase in natural gas margin of million at the remaining natural gas utilities wps  merc  and mgu  primarily driven by a combined increase in natural gas throughput volumes at wps  merc  and mgu  which had an approximate million positive impact on natural gas utility margins 
colder year over year weather had an approximate million positive impact on margins 
partially offsetting the positive impact of colder weather  were energy conservation efforts by residential customers and a larger number of customer disconnections year over year  which had an approximate million negative impact on margins 
the interim rate increase for merc  effective october   which had a positive impact on natural gas margin 
an approximate million year over year increase in margin at mgu related to an adjustment for recovery of prior natural gas costs in an mpsc proceeding 
compared with the regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased million  driven by the following the combined margin provided by pgl and nsg in of million 
the combined margin at mgu and merc increased million  from million in  to million in the increase in natural gas margin at mgu and merc was driven primarily by the fact that mgu and merc operated during the first quarter heating season in  but were not acquired by integrys energy group until after the first quarter heating season in wps s natural gas margin increased million  from million in  to million in the increase in wps s margin was driven by the retail natural gas rate increase and an increase in throughput volumes to higher margin residential customers due in part to colder year over year weather during the heating season 
the increase in throughput volumes sold to the electric utility did not have a significant impact on wps s natural gas utility margin 
operating income compared with operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased million  driven by the million increase in the natural gas utility margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to an increase in combined operating expenses at pgl and nsg of million  from million for to million for the increase in operating expenses related to pgl and nsg was primarily driven by the acquisition of these natural gas utilities on february  as a result  operating expenses for the period january  to the acquisition date were not included in the operating results 
a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million recognized in the second quarter of related to nsg 
a combined increase in bad debt expense  driven by the impact of high energy prices and worsening economic conditions on overall accounts receivable balances 
compared with operating income increased million  driven by the million increase in the regulated natural gas utility margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expense  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  and a million increase in taxes other than income taxes 
the increase in operating and maintenance expense was primarily related to the following combined operating and maintenance expenses of million incurred by pgl and nsg in combined operating and maintenance expense at mgu and merc that increased approximately million  primarily due to the fact that operating expenses at both of these utilities incurred prior to the acquisition were not included in earnings in  compared to incurring a full year of operating and maintenance expenses in for the year ended december   million of combined operating and maintenance expense related to external transition costs  primarily for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees 
for the year ended december   mgu and merc were allocated million of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the pec merger 
operating expenses related to wps s natural gas operations increased million year over year  due primarily to the allocation of million of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the pec merger 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily related to the merger with pec a combined million of depreciation and amortization expense was recognized at pgl and nsg from february  to december  and an increase in depreciation expense at merc and mgu these businesses were not included in results of operations for the full year in 
depreciation and amortization expense at wps s natural gas utility was relatively flat year over year 
the increase in taxes other than income taxes from to was primarily related to the merger with pec million of taxes other than income taxes were recognized at pgl and nsg in  and the acquisition of the michigan and minnesota natural gas distribution operations  which were not included in results of operations for the full year in taxes other than income taxes are primarily related to property taxes  gross receipts taxes  and payroll taxes paid by these companies 
other expense compared with other expense at the regulated natural gas utilities increased million  driven by a million increase in interest expense  partially offset by a million increase in miscellaneous income 
the increase in other expense was a result of a million increase in combined interest expense at pgl and nsg  from million in to million in the increase in interest expense at pgl and nsg is primarily due to the fact that these utilities were first acquired on february   and  therefore  did not recognize a full year of interest expense in the increase in interest expense was also due to additional long term debt borrowings and higher interest rates on new and remarketed long term debt 
the increase in other expense was offset by a million increase in afudc at wps related to the construction of natural gas laterals for connection to the guardian ii pipeline 
a decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in short term borrowing levels and a decrease in interest rates for wps s natural gas segment 
compared with other expense at the regulated natural gas utilities increased million  driven by a million increase in interest expense  partially offset by a million increase in miscellaneous income 
the increase in other expense was a result of combined interest expense of million  partially offset by million of miscellaneous income  recorded both at pgl and nsg from february   through december  regulated electric segment operations year ended december  change in over change in over revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins operating and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income taxes operating income miscellaneous income interest expense other expense income before taxes sales in kilowatt hours residential commercial and industrial wholesale other total sales in kilowatt hours weather wps heating degree days cooling degree days weather uppco heating degree days cooling degree days revenue compared with regulated electric utility segment revenue increased million  driven by a increase in electric sales volumes  which resulted in an approximate million increase in revenue year over year  related to an increase in wholesale volumes year over year  which drove an approximate million increase in revenue 
there was an approximate million increase in opportunity sales year over year as the electric utility had more low cost generation with weston becoming commercially operational in  combined with available capacity from lower sales volumes to residential customers 
in addition  wps experienced an approximate million increase in wholesale revenue  driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year 
the increase in revenue related to wholesale volumes was partially offset by a decrease in residential sales volumes and a decrease in commercial and industrial sales volumes year over year  which drove an approximate million decrease in revenue 
of this decrease in revenue  approximately million related to energy conservation efforts on the part of residential customers  which we believe was the result of high energy prices and the general economic slowdown 
approximately million related to decreased demand by our commercial and industrial customers in the third and fourth quarters of as the economy weakened 
in addition  cooler weather during the cooling season compared to contributed approximately million to the decrease in revenue 
an interim fuel surcharge approved by the pscw for wps s retail electric customers effective march   related to higher fuel and purchased power costs 
in addition  a surcharge increase was approved by the pscw effective july  both orders had an overall impact on revenue of approximately million 
contributing factors in this rate change were increased purchased power costs due to lower than expected generation from the new weston power plant during the start up phases  increased coal and coal transportation costs  and increased natural gas costs 
on september   the pscw reopened the fuel surcharge to review forecasted fuel costs as wps s current and anticipated annual fuel costs were below those projected in the fuel surcharge 
as a result of these lower costs  wps accrued at december  a refund payable in to its electric customers of approximately million  which is already excluded from the million noted above 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on wps s interim fuel surcharges 
a retail electric rate increase  effective january   which contributed an approximate million increase in revenue 
the full benefit of the retail electric rate increase  effective january   also contributed to the increase in revenue year over year 
per the pscw s order approving the pec merger  wps was not permitted to increase its base rates for natural gas or electric service prior to january  however  wps was allowed to adjust rates for changes in purchased power costs as well as fuel costs related to electric generation due to changes in nymex natural gas futures prices  delivered coal prices  and transmission costs 
the increase also included recovery of deferred and miso day costs over a one year period 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on wps s interim rate increase 
an approximate million increase in revenue at uppco related to increased energy and transmission costs in compared with increases in fuel and purchased power costs at uppco are passed directly through to customers in rates 
compared with regulated electric revenue increased million  driven by the following on january   the pscw issued a final written order to wps authorizing a retail electric rate increase of million  effective january   for wisconsin electric customers 
in june  the mpsc issued a final written order to uppco authorizing an annual retail electric rate increase for uppco of million  effective june  see note  regulatory environment  for more information related to the retail electric rate increases at wps and uppco 
on a per unit basis  fuel and purchased power costs were approximately higher in compared with in addition  sales volumes increased  primarily related to an increase in sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers  driven by warmer weather during the cooling season and colder weather during the heating season a portion of heating load is electric in  compared with the increase in sales volumes related to weather was partially offset by an approximate decrease in weather normalized residential and commercial and industrial customer usage  driven by customer conservation resulting from higher energy costs and weaker general economic conditions 
margin compared with the regulated electric utility segment margin increased million  driven by an increase in electric margin at wps 
the million increase in the electric margin at wps was a result of a million partial refund to wisconsin retail customers for of their portion of proceeds from the liquidation of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund 
pursuant to regulatory accounting  the decrease in the margin related to the refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expense in and  therefore  did not have an impact on earnings 
wps completed this refund in an approximate million increase in margin from the retail electric rate increase effective january   and the full benefit of the retail electric rate increase effective january  an approximate million increase in margin driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year 
an approximate million increase in regulated electric utility margin year over year driven by fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately million lower than what was recovered in rates during  compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately million higher than what was recovered in rates during as a result of approximately million of under recovered fuel and purchased power costs in the first quarter of  the pscw approved an interim rate surcharge effective march   and subsequently approved a higher final surcharge effective july  the million increase in electric margin includes lower fuel costs from the fuel window reset and the net impact of the refund accrued at december   payable in to electric customers from the reopening of the fuel surcharge on september   by the pscw 
these increases in the electric margin were offset by an approximate million decrease in margin due to a decline in residential and commercial and industrial sales volumes 
of this decrease  approximately million related to energy conservation efforts on the part of residential customers  which we believe were the result of high energy prices and the general economic slowdown 
approximately million related to decreased demand by our commercial and industrial customers in the third and fourth quarters of as the economy worsened 
in addition  cooler weather during the cooling season compared with contributed approximately million to the decrease in gross margin 
compared with the regulated electric margin increased million  driven by the following a million increase in the electric utility margin at wps 
wps s margin was positively impacted by the retail electric rate increases discussed above and by higher electric sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers related to weather 
favorable weather during both the heating and cooling seasons positively impacted margin by an estimated million 
the year over year change in wps s margin was also positively impacted by a million decrease in the margin related to the accrual of the refund to wholesale customers in of their portion of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund 
pursuant to regulatory accounting  the decrease in the margin related to this refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expenses in and  therefore  did not have an impact on earnings 
no such accrual to wholesale customers occurred in  however  the payment of the refund was made in partially offsetting the increase in wps s margin  fuel  and purchased power costs were higher than what was recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were less than what was recovered in rates during the same period in  driving a million negative variance in wps s electric margin 
in  fuel and purchased power prices were above what was projected in the rate case primarily due to higher than anticipated commodity costs and the market effects of unplanned plant outages 
on october   lightning hit weston  and the unit returned to full service on january  the unscheduled outage did not have a significant impact on the electric utility margin as the pscw approved deferral of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs directly related to the outage 
the outage did  however  cause the price of purchased power from other sources to increase 
excluding the additional purchased power which resulted from the weston outage  fuel and purchased power costs at wps increased in  compared with the same period in  primarily related to the higher per unit cost of fuel and purchased power required from the market to serve wps s customers 
uppco s margin increased approximately million  primarily due to its retail electric rate increase  effective june  and higher retail sales volumes 
operating income compared with operating income at the regulated electric utility segment increased million  driven by the million increase in the electric utility margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses was driven by a million year over year increase related to the partial amortization in of the regulatory liability previously recorded for wps s obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to wisconsin retail electric ratepayers 
a million increase in electric transmission expenses  primarily related to higher rates charged by miso and atc due to additional transmission costs 
a million increase in cost of capital and depreciation expense charged by ibs for assets transferred from wps to ibs in the beginning of and reported as operating and maintenance expense in similar costs were reported as depreciation and amortization expense in  prior to the start up of ibs 
a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  primarily related to million of depreciation expense from weston being placed in service for accounting purposes in april  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation related to assets transferred to ibs and reported in operating and maintenance expense in these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by an million decrease in electric maintenance expenses at wps  primarily due to major planned outages at the weston and weston generation stations  the de pere energy center  and the pulliam generation station  as well as several unplanned outages at the weston generation station in  compared with fewer outages in a decrease in external costs to achieve merger synergies of million related to the merger with pec  from million in  to million in this decrease occurred primarily because all external costs to achieve merger synergies incurred from july through march were reallocated in from the holding company segment to the other reportable segments  including the regulated electric segment 
these reportable segments are the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from the costs to achieve 
in addition  the reduction in external costs to achieve merger synergies was due to less integration work required in compared with compared with operating income increased million  driven by the million increase in regulated electric margin discussed above  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses at wps  and a combined million increase in depreciation and taxes other than income taxes at the regulated electric utilities 
the change in operating and maintenance expense at wps was primarily related to the following regulated electric maintenance expenses increased million  driven by longer than anticipated planned outages and a higher number of unplanned outages year over year which included major overhauls planned at the weston and weston generation stations and the de pere energy center  planned major turbine and generator work performed at the pulliam generation station  and several unplanned outages at the weston generation station 
regulated electric transmission expenses increased million  primarily related to higher rates charged by miso and atc due to additional transmission investment 
the regulated electric segment of wps was allocated external costs to achieve merger synergies of million for the year ended december  amortization in of the regulatory liability recorded for wps s obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to wholesale electric ratepayers contributed million to the increase in wps s operating and maintenance expense 
pursuant to regulatory accounting  the increase in operating and maintenance expense related to this refund was offset by a corresponding increase in margin and  therefore  did not have an impact on earnings 
lower pension  postretirement  and other employee benefit costs partially offset the increase in regulated electric operating and maintenance expense at wps 
an increase in depreciation expense related to continued capital investment at the electric utilities  while the increase in taxes other than income taxes reflected an increase in sales year over year 
other expense compared with other expense at the regulated electric utilities increased million  driven by a million increase in interest expense and a million decrease in miscellaneous income 
the increase in interest expense was due to higher long term borrowings at wps  primarily utilized to fund various construction projects and to retire short term borrowing levels related to construction 
the decrease in miscellaneous income was driven by a million decrease in interest income recognized related to the construction of transmission facilities wps funded on atc s behalf related to weston wps was reimbursed for these transmission facilities by atc in april a million gain on the sale of a generation facility by uppco in july the decrease in miscellaneous income was partially offset by an increase in afudc related to the wind generation project 
compared with other expense at the regulated electric utilities decreased million  driven by a million increase in miscellaneous income  partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in miscellaneous income was driven by a million increase in interest income recognized related to the construction of transmission facilities wps funded on atc s behalf pending the start up of weston a million gain on the sale of a generation facility by uppco in july the increase in interest expense was due to higher borrowings at wps  primarily utilized to fund various construction projects

revenue compared with revenues increased billion in compared with  primarily due to increased volumes  in part due to the merger with pec in and higher average sales prices in average sales prices rose in due to large market price increases from january  through june  market prices began to decline beginning in the third quarter of and continued to decline through the end of the year to levels below that of january  integrys energy services recognizes revenue at the time energy is delivered 
as a result  integrys energy services is currently recognizing revenue based on the higher market prices from contracts entered into earlier in the year 
compared with year over year  revenues increased approximately billion 
the increase was primarily due to increased volumes as a result of the addition of the nonregulated energy operations of pec and an average increase in electric prices of over 
in addition to revenue and volume contributions from the merger with pec  retail electric sales volumes and related revenue increased as a result of integrys energy services new retail electric product offerings to existing markets and expansion into new retail electric markets 
wholesale electric sales volumes and revenue increased as a result of the additional wholesale origination transactions 
wholesale natural gas volumes increased as a result of an increase in the profitability of wholesale origination structured natural gas transactions throughout and into some of these transactions were entered into in prior periods for future delivery  therefore  integrys energy services saw an increase in volumes in the periods in which these transactions settle 
retail natural gas volumes also increased  driven by favorable pricing compared with  which encouraged new and existing customers to enter into or extend supply contracts with integrys energy services 
margins changes in commodity prices subject a portion of our nonregulated operations to earnings volatility 
integrys energy services uses financial instruments to economically hedge risks associated with physical transactions 
the financial instruments mitigate the impacts of significant economic loss caused by fluctuations in market conditions  changing commodity prices  volumetric exposure  and other associated risks 
because derivative instruments utilized in these transactions may not qualify  or are not designated  as hedges under gaap  reported earnings for the nonregulated energy operations segment include the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments 
these values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as unrealized gains or losses within margin 
however  on the other side of these transactions  fluctuations in the fair value of the physical instruments that are subject to the economic hedges do not impact margin until settlement  as they do not meet the gaap definition of derivative instruments 
integrys energy services margin decreased million from to and increased million from to the table below provides a summary of the significant items contributing to the change in margin 
other significant items in the table below are primarily related to timing of gain and loss recognition of certain transactions and  prior to january   the settlement of the derivative instruments used to protect the value of section k federal tax credits

electric and other margins integrys energy services electric and other margins decreased million from to and increased million from to the and electric and other margin included the negative impact of million and million  respectively  of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the merger with pec 
the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in integrys energy services electric and other margins 
realized gains on structured origination contracts realized gains on structured origination transactions increased million  from million in to million in origination transactions are physical  customer based agreements with municipalities  merchant generators  cooperatives  municipalities  and regulated utilities 
the increase was primarily due to continued growth in existing markets with an emphasis on structured transactions with small environmentally friendly generators 
realized gains on structured origination contracts increased million  from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to continued growth in existing markets in the midwest and northeastern united states  as well as expansion into the markets in the western united states 
all other realized wholesale electric margin all other realized wholesale electric margin decreased million from to in general  realized margins are impacted by trading activity in prior periods 
integrys energy services recognizes realized margin when the contracts actually settle  which lag as much as to months from the time the contract was actually entered into 
the reduced volume of proprietary trading that began in continued to reduce realized margin in all other realized wholesale electric margin decreased million from to the decrease from to is due to the overall reduced level of proprietary trading in  due primarily to a decrease in electric price volatility during the first three quarters of  increased emphasis on structured electric transactions in  and the departure of several key traders in the third quarter of integrys energy services seeks to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its generation and energy contract portfolios through various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts  options  financial transmission rights  and capacity contracts 
period by period variability in the margin contributed by integrys energy services optimization strategies  generation facilities  and trading activities is expected due to changing market conditions and the timing associated with the settlement of these transactions 
a diverse mix of products and markets  combined with disciplined execution and exit strategies  generally allows integrys energy services to generate economic value and earnings from these activities while staying within the value at risk var limits authorized by integrys energy group s board of directors

realized retail electric margin the realized retail electric margin increased million from million in to million in the change was primarily due to the following an increase of million from operations in illinois due to the addition of new customers as a result of the pec merger and a reduced impact from purchase accounting in a million increase due to expansion in the mid atlantic region and the resolution of certain regulatory issues in northern maine 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease from operations in texas 
this reduction is a result of higher ancillary costs in texas and the effects of hurricane ike  which disrupted the electric infrastructure in texas for a period of time  causing some of integrys energy services customers to be without electricity or take only a fraction of their normal load during that period 
the realized retail electric margin increased million from million in to million in the change was primarily due to the following a million increase related to operations in illinois  driven by the merger with pec s nonregulated business and the addition of new customers due to the expiration of certain regulatory provisions in the state in that effectively opened the market to nonregulated energy suppliers 
a million increase related to operations in texas  as a result of further penetration into this market resulting from continued marketing efforts 
retail offerings in texas first began in the third quarter of a million increase related to operations in new england as new customers were added due to an increased sales focus in this region 
partially offsetting the increases discussed above was a million decrease related to michigan operations as many customers continued to return to utility suppliers as a result of high wholesale energy prices and changes in utility tariffs  which continued to make the michigan energy market less competitive 
also offsetting these increases was a million decrease related to operations in the state of new york  due to a change in the product mix offered to customers in response to utility rate structure changes 
retail and wholesale fair value adjustments from to  integrys energy services margin from electric retail and wholesale fair value adjustments decreased million  as it recognized million of non cash unrealized losses related to derivative instruments in  compared with million of non cash unrealized gains during from to  margin from retail and wholesale fair value adjustments increased million  from million of non cash unrealized losses in to million of non cash unrealized gains in the non cash unrealized gains and losses resulted from the application of gaap derivative accounting rules to integrys energy services portfolio of electric customer supply contracts  requiring that these derivative instruments be adjusted to fair market value 
the derivative instruments are utilized to mitigate the price  volume  and ancillary risks associated with related customer sales contracts 
these customer sales contracts are not adjusted to fair value  as they do not meet the definition of derivative instruments under gaap  creating an accounting mismatch 
as such  the non cash unrealized gains and losses related to the customer supply contracts will vary each period  with non cash unrealized gains being recognized in periods of increasing energy prices and non cash unrealized losses being recognized in periods of declining energy prices  and will ultimately reverse when the related customer sales contracts settle 
although energy prices rose approximately in the first half of  they declined approximately in the second half of the year  which led to the recognition of large non cash unrealized losses in on these electric customer supply contracts 
these unrealized losses will turnaround in future years as the contracts settle 
our mark to market activity also reflects increases in portfolio reserves in recognition of the increased risk of credit losses and reduced market liquidity 
finally  our mark to market activity was also negatively impacted as our short term cost of borrowing increased 
the discount rate is a component of the fair value of our derivative portfolio and  therefore  the current increased interest rates resulted in a reduction in the fair value presented on the balance sheet 
in  energy prices increased  resulting in unrealized gains 
oil option activity oil option activity drove a million decrease in electric and other margins from to there was no activity related to these oil options in prior to  oil options were utilized to protect the value of a portion of integrys energy services section k federal tax credits from to however  companies can no longer generate tax credits from the production of synthetic fuel as the provisions of section k of the internal revenue code expired effective december  as a result  integrys energy services exercised substantially all of its remaining oil options in oil option activity drove a million increase in electric and other margins from to net mark to market and realized losses on oil options of million were recognized in  compared with net mark to market and realized gains on oil options of million in these derivative instruments were not designated as hedging instruments and  as a result  changes in the fair value were recorded in earnings 
the increase in the fair value of these instruments in over reflects increased oil prices 
liquidation of electric supply contract in the fourth quarter of  an electricity supplier exiting the wholesale market in maine requested that integrys energy services liquidate a firm contract to buy power in and at that time  integrys energy services recognized an million gain related to the liquidation of the contract and entered into a new contract with another supplier for firm power in and to supply its customers in maine 
the cost to purchase power under the new contract was more than the cost under the liquidated contract 
the liquidation and subsequent replacement of this contract resulted in a million increase in realized wholesale electric margins from to and a million increase in realized wholesale electric margins from to the replacement contract increased the cost of purchased power needed to serve customers in maine by million in  compared with million in there was no impact on electric margin in natural gas margins integrys energy services natural gas margins decreased million from to and increased million from to the and natural gas margins included the negative impact of million and million  respectively  of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the merger with pec 
the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in integrys energy services natural gas margins 
lower of cost or market inventory adjustments the spot price of natural gas decreased significantly during the second half of below the average cost of natural gas in inventory which integrys energy services had acquired and injected earlier in  which resulted in a lower of cost or market adjustment  as required by gaap 
this adjustment contributed a million decrease in non cash realized natural gas margins from to  and a million decrease in non cash realized natural gas margins from to the negative impact on realized margin related to these inventory adjustments was offset by unrealized gains recognized in and on derivative instruments utilized to mitigate the price risk on natural gas inventory underlying natural gas storage transactions see other fair value adjustments below 
other realized natural gas margins other realized natural gas margins increased million  from million in  to million in  primarily related to realized gains on wholesale natural gas storage transactions 
in over  integrys energy services increased its storage withdrawals which drove the year over year increase in other realized natural gas margins 
in addition  integrys energy services placed greater emphasis on structured wholesale natural gas transactions in in existing markets  which also contributed to the increase 
these structured transactions involve serving customers such as regulated utilities  pipelines  retail marketers  and other large end users of natural gas 
other realized natural gas margins increased million  from million in  to million in the majority of this increase  million  was driven by margin contributed by the nonregulated retail natural gas marketing operations added with the pec merger and improved supply optimization  as integrys energy services was able to secure lower supply costs for firm sales commitments to retail natural gas customers in ohio and illinois 
the remaining increase in realized natural gas margins was driven by the nonregulated wholesale natural gas marketing operations added with the pec merger 
spot to forward differential integrys energy services experiences earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which runs annually from april through march of the next year 
generally  injections of natural gas into storage inventory take place in the summer months and natural gas is withdrawn from storage in the winter months 
integrys energy services policy is to hedge the value of natural gas storage with contracts in the over the counter and futures markets  effectively locking in a margin on the natural gas in storage 
however  fair market value hedge accounting rules require the natural gas in storage to be marked to market using spot prices  while the future sales contracts are marked to market using forward prices 
when the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price of natural gas  integrys energy services experiences volatility in its earnings 
consequently  earnings volatility may occur within the contract period for natural gas in storage 
the accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions 
the natural gas storage cycle had a positive million impact on natural gas margins from to there was no material impact on margin as a result of the natural gas storage cycle in compared with a million positive impact in at december   the market value of natural gas in storage was not significantly different than the market value of future sales contracts related to the natural gas storage cycle 
the natural gas storage cycle had a negative million impact on natural gas margins from to there was no material impact on margin as a result of the natural gas storage cycle in compared with a million positive impact in at december   the market value of natural gas in storage was million less than the market value of future sales contracts net unrealized loss related to the natural gas storage cycle 
other fair value adjustments other derivative accounting required fair value adjustments primarily relate to changes in the fair market value of contracts utilized to mitigate market price risk related to certain natural gas storage contracts  as well as basis swaps utilized to mitigate market price risk associated with natural gas transportation contracts and certain natural gas sales contracts 
earnings volatility results from the application of derivative accounting rules to the transactions used to mitigate price risk requiring that these derivative instruments be reflected at fair market value  without a corresponding offset related to the physical natural gas storage contracts  the natural gas transportation contracts  or the natural gas sales contracts as these contracts are not considered derivative instruments 
therefore  there is no gain or loss recognized on the natural gas storage contracts unless the inventory underlying these storage contracts becomes subject to lower of cost or market adjustments  as was the case in  and to a lesser extent in and as well  the transportation contracts  or the customer sales contracts until physical settlement of these contracts occurs 
in  the impact of these fair value adjustments drove a million increase in the natural gas margins as unrealized gains on these instruments were million in  compared with unrealized gains of million in  the impact of these fair value adjustments drove a million increase in the natural gas margins as unrealized gains on these instruments were million in  compared with unrealized gains of million operating income loss compared with operating income at integrys energy services decreased million  from million in to a million operating loss in this decrease resulted primarily from the million decrease in margin discussed above 
in addition  there was a million increase in operating and maintenance expense 
operating and maintenance expense increased from million in to million in  driven largely by a million increase in bad debt expense  million of which resulted from the bankruptcy of lehman brothers in the third quarter of  a million increase in broker commissions as a result of higher transaction volumes  and higher employee benefit costs 
compared with operating income at integrys energy services increased million  from million in  to million in  driven by the million increase in margin discussed above  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expense 
the increase in operating and maintenance expense was driven by higher payroll and benefit costs related to additional employees required as a result of continued business expansion activities at integrys energy services the most significant of which related to the merger of pec s nonregulated operation into integrys energy services 
a million pre tax gain on the sale of wps esi gas storage  llc  million of costs to achieve merger synergies and additional costs related to plant outages of million in also contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expense 
other expense compared with other expense at integrys energy services decreased million  from million in to million in this decrease resulted primarily from an increase in miscellaneous income of million  driven by a million decrease in pre tax net losses related to integrys energy services former investment in a synthetic fuel facility 
this increase in miscellaneous income was partially offset by a decrease of million in foreign currency gains related to integrys energy services canadian subsidiaries and a million decrease in interest and dividend income on margin deposits 
compared with other expense decreased million  from million in  to million in the decrease resulted primarily from a million decrease in pre tax net losses recognized year over year related to integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility 
integrys energy services took less production from this facility in compared with a million increase in foreign currency gains at integrys energy services canadian subsidiaries in  which was offset by related losses in gross margin  also contributed to the decrease 
these transactions are substantially hedged from an economic perspective  resulting in no significant impact on income loss available for common shareholders 
minority interest compared with a decrease of million in minority interest related to integrys energy services synthetic fuel operations 
in  integrys energy services partner elected to stop receiving production from the synthetic fuel facility and  therefore  did not share in losses from this facility 
holding company and other segment operations change in change in year ended december  over over millions operating loss other income expense n a n a income loss before taxes n a n a operating loss compared with operating loss at the holding company and other segment improved million during compared with the decrease in the operating loss was driven by reductions in operating expenses related to consulting fees  compensation and benefits  and contractor costs at the holding company 
operating income of million generated at ibs  which related to return on capital included in its service charges beginning in partially offsetting the decrease in operating loss  was a million increase in the year over year operating loss related to external costs to achieve merger synergies associated with the pec merger 
this increase occurred primarily because in march all external costs to achieve merger synergies incurred from july through march were allocated from the holding company and other segment where they were initially recorded to the other reportable segments  which are the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from these costs 
this resulted in lower operating expenses at the holding company and other segment during compared with the operating loss at the holding company and other segment decreased million during compared with the change was driven by a million decrease in operating expenses  primarily related to the reallocation of external costs to achieve merger synergies associated with the pec merger incurred from july through march in march  all external costs to achieve were reallocated from the holding company and other segment where they were initially recorded to other reportable segments  which are the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from the costs to achieve 
other income expense compared with other income increased million and was driven by a million increase in income from integrys energy group s approximate ownership interest in atc 
integrys energy group recorded million of pre tax equity earnings from atc during  compared with million of pre tax equity earnings during atc s earnings continue to increase due to a significant capital expansion program 
a million decrease in external interest expense due to lower interest rates and lower average short term borrowings used for working capital requirements at integrys energy group 
a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of pep in september was used to pay down the short term debt 
compared with other income decreased million and was driven by a million increase in external interest expense  driven by additional borrowings assumed in the merger with pec  as well as an increase in short term and long term borrowings required to fund the acquisitions of the natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota  and transaction and transition costs related to the merger with pec 
a million gain on the sale of integrys energy group s one third interest in guardian pipeline  llc in april also contributed to the decrease in year over year earnings 
the decrease in other income was partially offset by an million increase in earnings from integrys energy group s approximate ownership interest in atc 
integrys energy group recorded million of pre tax equity earnings from atc during the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in provision for income taxes year ended december  effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the impact of large permanent tax deductions pertaining to items that exceeded the related book expense being applied to the lower income before taxes in  compared with in addition  in we recognized million of investment tax credits related to solar projects completed in the fourth quarter of these were offset by the reduction in section k tax credits in due to the december   expiration of section k of the internal revenue code that made tax credits available from the production and sale of synthetic fuel 
in  our ownership in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in recognizing the tax benefit of section k federal tax credits of million compared with million of section k tax credits recognized in the increase in the effective tax rate was driven by a decrease in section k federal tax credits recognized in compared with the decrease in section k federal tax credits recognized was driven by the impact of high oil prices on our ability to realize the benefit of section k federal tax credits 
section k federal tax credits recognized from the production and sale of synthetic fuel were million in  compared with million in discontinued operations  net of tax compared with income from discontinued operations  net of tax  decreased million in  compared with in the third quarter of  integrys energy services sold its subsidiary mid american power  llc  which owned the stoneman generation facility  located in wisconsin 
the historical revenue  expenses  and effects of disposing of this facility were not significant 
in the fourth quarter of  integrys energy services recognized an additional million after tax gain on the sale of this facility in discontinued operations when a previously contingent payment was paid by the buyer 
this contingent payment resulted from legislation that passed in the fourth quarter of  which extended the production tax credits available for certain biomass facilities 
during  million of after tax income from discontinued operations was recognized related to pep 
this included an after tax gain of million on the sale 
in  discontinued operations reflect the million impact of tax adjustments related to the pep sale 
during  wps niagara generation  llc recognized after tax income of million from discontinued operations  primarily related to the million after tax gain on the sale of this facility 
compared with income from discontinued operations  net of tax  increased million  from after tax income of million in to after tax income of million in in september  integrys energy group completed the sale of pep for approximately million 
post closing adjustments in the amount of million were settled in february related to this sale  which reduced the sale price to million 
these post closing adjustments were funded through other current liabilities at december  during the year ended december   million of income from discontinued operations was recognized related to pep  which included an after tax gain of million on the sale 
discontinued operations  net of tax  related to wps niagara generation  llc niagara  which was sold in january  increased million  from income of million in to income of million in the increase in income generated from niagara was mostly due to a million after tax gain on the sale of the facility 
partially offsetting these increases were discontinued operations related to sunbury generation  llc sunbury 
income from discontinued operations related to sunbury was million for the period january   through the date of sale in july  including a million after tax gain on the sale of this facility

balance sheet cash and cash equivalents increased million  from million at december   to million at december  for a detailed explanation for the change in the cash and cash equivalents balance  see liquidity and capital resources 
net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues increased million  from  million at december   to  million at december   primarily due to the following net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues at integrys energy services increased million  driven primarily by an increase in electric and natural gas revenues in the fourth quarter of  compared with the same period in  due mainly to higher volumes sold 
net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues at pgl increased million  driven primarily by an increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of  compared with the same period in the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher natural gas prices 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in wps s net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues  primarily due to an million receivable at december   from atc related to the transmission facilities required to support weston that wps funded on atc s behalf 
wps received payment for the atc receivable in this decrease was partially offset by a million year over year increase in accrued unbilled revenues 
inventories increased million  from million at december   to million at december  the inventory balance at wps increased million  driven by a million increase in natural gas in storage due to an increase in natural gas prices year over year  and an increase in fossil fuel inventory of million  primarily due to an increase in coal prices and an increase in coal quantities  related to weston becoming operational in june pgl s inventory increased million due to an increase in natural gas prices and volumes year over year 
at december   compared to december   total assets from risk management activities increased  million and total liabilities from risk management activities increased  million 
the increase in assets and liabilities from risk management activities was driven by changes in the fair values of the underlying derivative contracts  driven by extremely volatile energy prices in total liabilities from risk management activities also increased at pgl and nsg  primarily due to changes in the fair values of the underlying derivative contracts 
total regulatory assets increased million  from  million at december   to  million at december  the regulatory asset related to pension and other postretirement related items increased million  primarily related to an increase in the unfunded status of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans due to decreases in the value of plan assets during also contributing to the increase was the regulatory asset related to derivatives  which increased million year over year  due to an increase in pgl s and nsg s net risk management liabilities arising from changes in natural gas prices 
partially offsetting these increases was the regulatory asset related to environmental remediation costs  which decreased million year over year  mainly due to pgl collecting these costs in rates 
see note  regulatory assets and liabilities  for more information 
net property  plant  and equipment increased million  from  million at december   to  million at december   due primarily to the following net property  plant  and equipment at wps increased million

the increase due to capital expenditures was partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of million in net property  plant  and equipment at pgl increased million  primarily due to capital expenditures of million  partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of million 
capital expenditures in related mainly to the natural gas distribution systems 
net property  plant  and equipment at integrys energy services increased million  primarily due to capital expenditures related to solar energy and landfill gas projects 
accounts payable increased million  from  million at december   to  million at december  accounts payable at integrys energy services increased million  primarily due to an increase in the volume of natural gas borrowed 
this increase was partially offset by a million year over year decrease in accounts payable at wps driven by the completion of weston  which became commercially operational in june wps paid contractors related to work performed at weston during as these contracts were completed and closed out  and purchased power decreased  mainly as a result of weston becoming operational 
detailed explanations for changes in the short term and long term debt balances year over year are included in note  short term debt and lines of credit  and note  long term debt 
environmental remediation liabilities decreased million  from million at december   to million at december  the decrease related mainly to expenditures for manufactured gas plant remediation at pgl 
see note  commitments and contingencies  for more information 
the million year over year increase in long term pension and other postretirement liabilities and the million year over year decrease in pension and other postretirement assets were primarily related to a decrease in the value of plan assets during related to losses on investments  which caused an increase in the unfunded status of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our cash balances  liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to equity capital markets and available borrowing capacity provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
our borrowing costs can be impacted by short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies 
our operating cash flows and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
due to unprecedented volatility within the global financial markets beginning in the second half of  integrys energy group has been exposed to increased interest costs and challenges  at times  accessing short term capital markets 
due to disruptions in the commercial paper markets  integrys energy group made draws under its syndicated revolving credit agreements for funds that would normally have been borrowed in the commercial paper market  and million of these borrowings were outstanding at december  operating cash flows compared with net cash used for operating activities was million in  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million in the million year over year increase in cash used for operating activities was driven by a million decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable collections  as colder weather conditions led to higher natural gas throughput volumes in the fourth quarter  compared with the same quarter in  contributing to higher accounts receivable balances 
also contributing to higher accounts receivable balances  integrys energy group and its subsidiaries  primarily integrys energy services  had cash collateral payments outstanding at december   that were million higher than cash collateral payments outstanding at december  the increase in cash collateral payments was driven by large mark to market losses incurred by integrys energy services during the latter part of  due to declining prices  as discussed in more detail in results of operations integrys energy services operations 
a million increase in cash used for natural gas inventory purchases due to an increase in the average price of natural gas during the summer of when natural gas is generally injected into inventory  compared with the same period in an million decrease in net refunds of regulatory assets and liabilities  driven by a decrease in the refund to ratepayers in  compared with  of proceeds wps received from the liquidation of the nonqualified decommissioning trust fund upon the sale of kewaunee 
compared with during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a million decrease in working capital requirements year over year 
it is important to note that changes in working capital balances at february   as a result of the pec merger are not incorporated in the consolidated statement of cash flows  as the merger was a noncash transaction 
only pec changes in working capital from the merger date to december   are included 
inventory levels at integrys energy services increased from december   to december   but this change was less than the increase from december   to december   driving the majority of the decrease in working capital requirements 
integrys energy services continued to see growth in its natural gas business in both new and existing markets 
the year over year change in natural gas inventories at the regulated utilities was not significant 
the remaining increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a year over year increase in income available for common shareholders 
investing cash flows compared with net cash used for investing activities was million in  compared with million in the million year over year increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by a million increase in cash used for capital expenditures discussed below  partially offset by the reimbursement of million from atc  related to the construction of the transmission facilities required to support weston  and a million year over year increase in cash proceeds received from the sale of property  plant  and equipment 
compared with net cash used for investing activities was million in  compared with  million in the million decrease was driven by million of cash used by integrys energy group to acquire natural gas operations in michigan and minnesota in also contributing million to the decrease in net cash used for investing activities in was wps s liquidation of the cash that was deposited into an escrow account in  which was used for the payment of the outstanding principal balance of first mortgage bonds in january discussed below in significant financing activities 
partially offsetting these decreases were million of proceeds received from the sale of our investment in guardian pipeline llc and wps esi gas storage  llc in and a million year over year increase in capital expenditures discussed below 
capital expenditures capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended december    and were as follows reportable segment millions electric utility natural gas utility integrys energy services holding company and other integrys energy group the increase in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility segment in compared with was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures at pgl and nsg due to the fact that they were not acquired until february   as well as construction of the natural gas lateral infrastructure that will connect wps s natural gas distribution system to the guardian ii natural gas pipeline 
the increase in capital expenditures at integrys energy services in compared with was primarily due to solar energy projects as well as the construction of a pipeline that will transport methane gas produced at a landfill for use at a chemical plant as a replacement for natural gas 
the decrease in capital expenditures at the electric utility in compared with was mainly due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the construction of weston the increase in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility was primarily driven by capital requirements of pgl and nsg  which were acquired in the pec merger on february  capital expenditures in for pgl and nsg related mainly to the natural gas distribution systems 
the increase in capital expenditures at integrys energy services was due to capital required to open new offices in colorado  michigan  and washington  dc  as well as to move the chicago office  improvements at various generation facilities  new systems infrastructure  and the winnebago energy center landfill gas project 
the increase in capital expenditures at the holding company and other segment was driven by the purchase of a corporate airplane

on november   standard poor s revised the outlook on integrys energy group and all of its subsidiaries to negative from stable 
the revised outlook reflects pressure on the current credit ratings given integrys energy groups liquidity needs for its nonregulated business  as well as cash flow measures that have not met standard poor s expectations since the pec merger 
on march   standard poor s raised the senior secured debt rating for wps one notch from a to a 
the new rating was a result of a review and changes made to the collateral coverage requirements standard and poor s uses when assigning recovery ratings to united states utility first mortgage bonds 
in december  standard poor s and moody s withdrew the ratings assigned to pec s commercial paper at the request of integrys energy group 
on november   standard poor s revised the outlook on integrys energy group and all of its subsidiaries to stable from negative 
standard poor s outlook had been negative since february   for all integrys energy group companies  as discussed below 
the revised outlook reflected integrys energy group s progress to improve its financial position and business profiles since its one notch downgrade on february  on november   standard poor s also reaffirmed its a rating on wps s senior secured debt 
on september   standard poor s raised the senior secured debt for nsg one notch from a to a 
the new rating was the result of a review and changes made to the collateral coverage requirements standard and poor s uses when assigning recovery ratings to united states utility first mortgage bonds 
on february   standard poor s lowered the corporate credit rating on integrys energy group to a from a and removed it from creditwatch with negative implications 
standard poor s also lowered integrys energy group s unsecured ratings to bbb from a and all other issue specific ratings by one notch 
standard poor s stated that the ratings actions were due to concerns related to plans to expand its energy marketing business  the dividend requirements resulting from the pec merger  moderate capital expenditure requirements  lower than expected performance at mgu and merc  uncertainty regarding future rate relief  and full integration of the newly acquired pec utilities 
at the same time  standard poor s lowered all wps s issue specific ratings by one notch as they stated wps s liquidity is being pressured by its ongoing construction program 
standard poor s affirmed all pec  pgl  and nsg ratings 
standard poor s outlook for all integrys energy group related companies was negative pending successful integration of recent acquisitions 
on february   moody s downgraded the senior unsecured rating of integrys energy group to a from a  the bank credit facility to a from a  the commercial paper rating to prime from prime  and the junior subordinated notes to baa from a moody s also downgraded wps s senior secured rating to aa from aa  its senior unsecured bank credit facility to a from aa  and its preferred stock to a from a and confirmed wps s commercial paper rating at prime at the same time  moody s affirmed the ratings of pgl and nsg 
moody s stated that the rating actions to downgrade were due to concerns about increases in integrys energy group s consolidated debt levels and business risk profile evidenced by the increased scale and scope of the post merger non regulated energy marketing business plus the entry into the historically more challenging regulatory jurisdiction of illinois 
moody s outlook for all integrys energy group related companies is stable 
on february   moody s also upgraded the senior unsecured rating of pec to a from baa  conforming it with those of integrys energy group  and affirmed all other ratings for pec 
moody s actions to upgrade the senior unsecured rating were due to the expected business risk improvement from the merger with integrys energy group  which resulted in the sale of pep and transferred pec s energy and marketing business to integrys energy services  leaving pec holding only the two regulated subsidiaries  pgl and nsg 
in addition  the upgrade reflects integrys energy group s guaranty of the million of pec notes due in discontinued operations compared with net cash provided by discontinued operations was million in compared with million in the decrease in net cash provided by discontinued operations was driven by the approximate million of proceeds received from the sale of pep 
compared with net cash provided by discontinued operations was million in compared with million in the increase in net cash provided by discontinued operations was driven by approximately million of proceeds received from the sale of pep in the third quarter of post closing adjustments in the amount of million were settled in february related to this sale  which reduced the sale price to million 
these post closing adjustments were funded through other current liabilities at december  and  therefore  are included in note d  summary of significant accounting policies cash and cash equivalents  as a non cash transaction

capital resources as of december   integrys energy group and each of its subsidiaries were in compliance with all respective covenants relating to outstanding short term and long term debt and expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future 
integrys energy group and certain of its subsidiaries revolving credit agreements and term loans contain financial and other covenants  including but not limited to  a requirement to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed  excluding non recourse debt 
failure to meet these covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and or termination of the agreements 
termination of the agreements could permit lenders to require immediate repayment of the outstanding borrowings thereunder 
integrys energy group and certain of its subsidiaries long term debt obligations contain covenants related to payment of principal and interest when due and various financial reporting obligations 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations 
integrys energy group plans to meet its capital requirements for the period through primarily through internally generated funds  net of forecasted dividend payments  and debt and equity financings 
integrys energy group plans to maintain current debt to equity ratios at appropriate levels to support current credit ratings and corporate growth 
management believes integrys energy group has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs 
see item  management discussion and analysis  other future considerations for additional information 
see note  short term debt and lines of credit  for more information on our credit facilities and other short term credit agreements 
integrys energy group has the ability to publicly issue debt  equity  certain types of hybrid securities  and other financial instruments under an existing shelf registration statement  which expires in april specific terms and conditions of securities issued will be determined prior to the actual issuance of any specific security 
integrys energy group s board of directors has authorized the issuance of up to million of equity  debt  or other securities under this shelf registration statement  million of which was used in december when integrys energy group issued junior subordinated notes 
integrys energy group plans to file a new shelf registration statement in the first quarter of in may  wps filed a shelf registration statement 
as a result  wps may issue up to million of senior debt securities within the next three years with amounts  prices  and terms to be determined at the time of future offerings 
on december   wps issued million of  year senior notes under this shelf registration statement 
other future considerations impact of financial market turmoil volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets has impacted integrys energy group in a number of ways 
due to unprecedented volatility within the global financial markets beginning in the second half of  integrys energy group has been exposed to increased interest costs and challenges  at times  accessing short term capital markets 
due to disruptions in the commercial paper markets  integrys energy group made draws under its syndicated revolving credit agreements for funds that would normally have been borrowed in the commercial paper market  and million of these borrowings were outstanding at december  in addition  we believe that a decrease in the number of wholesale counterparties actively trading in the energy markets has reduced market liquidity and increased the risk of counterparty concentrations 
this factor  combined with worsening economic conditions  has also increased the risk of credit losses 
a decline in the overall level of natural gas and electricity prices has resulted in increased cash margin calls on the exchanges utilized by integrys energy group for economically hedging its supply obligations 
in response to the factors discussed above  integrys energy group has taken several steps to improve its available liquidity 
in the fourth quarter of  several transactions were closed in support of this effort 
first  pgl issued million of first mortgage bonds  and nsg issued million of first mortgage bonds in private placement transactions 
next  integrys energy group entered into an approximate million drawn credit facility extending through march and entered into a million undrawn credit facility extending to may finally  wps issued million of year fading lien first mortgage bonds 
in addition to the foregoing  integrys energy services has adjusted its product pricing strategy to account for the increased operating costs  collateral requirements  business risks  and potential cash margining impact 
this new pricing strategy has reduced the flow of new business  therefore reducing future liquidity requirements  while improving the profitability of transactions that are executed 
management believes that these efforts have reduced its exposure to adverse market conditions 
while the impact of continued market volatility and the extent and impacts of any economic downturn cannot be predicted  integrys energy group currently believes it has sufficient operating flexibility and access to funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity 
also  as integrys energy group heads out of the winter heating season  the natural gas storage cycle at both the regulated natural gas utilities and integrys energy services will aid in the generation of positive cash flow as inventory that has been built up in storage will be sold to customers 
these positive cash flows will be used to reduce short term debt 
the recent volatility in global capital markets has also led to a reduction in the current market value of long term investments held in integrys energy group s pension and other postretirement benefit plan trusts 
the recent decline in asset value of the plans will likely result in higher pension and other postretirement benefit expenses  and additional future funding requirements 
impact of divesting of or scaling back the nonregulated business segment integrys energy group has made a decision to divest of its nonregulated energy services business segment  integrys energy services  or reduce its size  risk  and financial requirements in response to increased collateral requirements at a time when global credit and financial markets are constraining the availability and increasing the cost of capital 
as a result  integrys energy services operations will either be fully or partially divested  or scaled back to include only the most profitable products and markets  resulting in lower operating expenses and a reduced level of financial liquidity support  while invested capital will be managed downward in order to obtain an acceptable level of return 
integrys energy group is seeking to deploy its capital to areas with more desirable risk adjusted rates of return 
execution of this strategic decision will result in lower earnings capacity from this business segment going forward  although  in return  integrys energy group expects an improved business risk profile and enhanced financial security 
a divestiture of the nonregulated business segment  or a reduced segment scale  will also allow integrys energy group to either eliminate or reduce the amount of credit facilities and other forms of financial support committed to integrys energy services 
regulatory matters and rate trends to mitigate the volatility of the price of natural gas used for electric generation  and purchased power costs in and beyond  wps is employing risk management techniques pursuant to its pscw approved risk plan and policy  including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
on february   the five utilities subject to the current wisconsin fuel rules filed proposed changes to the fuel rules with the pscw 
the primary proposed change was to implement a dead band to limit a utility s annual exposure or opportunity to a maximum of of fuel costs 
the proposed dead band differs from the current trigger mechanism in that it would allow a utility to recover or refund all fuel costs outside of the band  rather than only those costs after the trigger date 
a proposed rule for pscw chapter  cost of fuel  was issued by the pscw on july   incorporating many of the components of the utilities proposal  with a bandwidth as opposed to the bandwidth recommended by the utilities 
wps filed comments on the proposed fuel rules  continuing to support a true dead band of 
the pscw will need to agree on a proposed rule that will then be forwarded to the legislature for review and promulgation 
in the current political  economic  and regulatory environment  the focus on energy efficiency can lead to the implementation of decoupling mechanisms 
under decoupling  utilities are allowed to adjust rates to recover or refund the difference between the actual and authorized margin impact of variations in volumes 
in the recently completed wps rate case  the pscw approved a settlement filed by wps and the wisconsin citizens utility board to implement decoupling for natural gas and electric residential and small commercial sales  along with several energy efficiency initiatives 
in approving the settlement  the pscw capped the annual amount that can be recovered under the decoupling mechanism to million for natural gas service  and million for electric service 
on january   wps requested rehearing to remove or increase the decoupling caps 
on february   in a written order  the pscw increased the caps to million for natural gas service and million for electric service 
recently passed legislation in michigan authorizes the mpsc to approve decoupling mechanisms  and in its january rate order  mgu was ordered to submit a proposal for decoupling in its next rate case filing 
in minnesota  the legislature required the mpuc to evaluate decoupling 
the mpuc is currently engaged in that process and has sought and received comments on decoupling mechanisms from utilities and interveners in minnesota 
decoupling for residential and small commercial sales was approved by the icc for pgl and nsg on a four year trial basis on february   and became effective march  interveners  including the illinois attorney general  oppose decoupling  and have appealed the icc s approval 
pgl and nsg are actively supporting the icc s decision to approve decoupling

uncollectible accounts the reserves for uncollectible accounts at integrys energy group reflect management s best estimate of probable losses on the accounts receivable balances 
the reserves are based on known troubled accounts  historical experience  and other currently available evidence 
provisions for bad debt expense are affected by changes in various factors  including the impacts of the economy  energy prices  and weather 
the impact of higher prices and the declining economic environment could cause more accounts receivable to become uncollectible 
higher levels of uncollectible balances would negatively impact integrys energy group s results of operations and could result in higher working capital requirements 
goodwill impairment testing integrys energy group performs its required annual goodwill impairment tests each april sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires goodwill to be tested on an annual basis and between required annual testing dates if certain conditions exist 
one of these conditions is a change in business climate  which may be evidenced by  among other things  a prolonged decline in a company s market capitalization below book value 
any annual or interim goodwill impairment test could result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for more information on goodwill balances for integrys energy group s reporting units at december  new laws in february  the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law

market price risk management activities market price risk management activities include the electric and natural gas marketing and related risk management activities of integrys energy services 
integrys energy services marketing and trading operations manage electricity and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments 
derivative instruments are utilized in these operations 
integrys energy services measures the fair value of derivative instruments on a mark to market basis 
the fair value is included in assets or liabilities from risk management activities on integrys energy group s consolidated balance sheets  with an offsetting entry to other comprehensive income for the effective portion of cash flow hedges  also on integrys energy group s consolidated balance sheets  or to earnings 
the following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of integrys energy services assets and liabilities from risk management activities for the year ended december  integrys energy services mark to market roll forward millions oil options natural gas electric total fair value of contracts at december  less contracts realized or settled during period plus changes in fair value of contracts in existence at december  fair value of contracts at december  reflects the values reported on the balance sheets for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates 
includes the value of contracts in existence at december   that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of december  includes unrealized gains and losses on contracts that existed at december   and contracts that were entered into subsequent to december   which were included in integrys energy services portfolio at december   as well as gains and losses at the inception of contracts 
there were  in many cases  derivative positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period 
the realized gains or losses from these derivative positions are not reflected in the table above

integrys energy group s management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
risk management activities integrys energy group has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
at december   those derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities 
if the derivatives qualify for regulatory deferral subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the contracts 
in addition  integrys energy group may apply the normal purchases and sales exception  provided by sfas no 
 as amended  to certain derivative contracts 
the normal purchases and sales exception provides that recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when integrys energy group enters into contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases 
in addition  integrys energy group uses cash flow hedge accounting to protect against changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
fair value hedge accounting may be used when integrys energy group holds assets  liabilities  or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk of changes in commodity prices or interest rates 
to the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge 
derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of sfas no 
 as amended  are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets of integrys energy group 
changes in fair value  except effective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral  generally affect income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
in conjunction with the implementation of sfas no 
 on january   integrys energy group categorized its fair value measurements into three levels within a fair value hierarchy 
see note t  summary of significant accounting policies fair value  and note  fair value  for more information 
integrys energy group has based its valuations on observable inputs whenever possible 
however  at times  the valuation of certain derivative instruments requires the use of internally developed valuation techniques and or significant unobservable inputs 
these valuations require a significant amount of management judgment and are classified as level measurements 
of the total risk management assets on integrys energy group s consolidated balance sheets  million utilized level measurements 
of the total risk management liabilities  million utilized level measurements 
integrys energy group believes these valuations represent the fair values of these instruments as of the reporting date  however  the actual amounts realized upon settlement of these instruments could vary materially from the reported amounts due to movements in market prices and changes in the liquidity of certain markets 
as a component of the fair value determination  integrys energy group considers counterparty credit risk including its own credit risk and liquidity risk 
the liquidity component of the fair value determination may be especially subjective when limited liquid market information is available 
under sfas no 
 beginning january   integrys energy services no longer includes transaction costs in these fair value determinations  but included this in determining fair value prior to changes in the underlying assumptions for these components of fair value at december   would have the following effects change in components effect on fair value of net risk management assets at december  millions increase decrease decrease increase these hypothetical changes in fair value would be included in current and long term assets and liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheets and as part of nonregulated revenue on the consolidated statements of income  unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  in which case potential changes would be included in other comprehensive income cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of common shareholders equity 
purchase accounting the pec merger  as well as the acquisitions of natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota in  were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
under this statement  the purchase price paid by the acquirer  including transaction costs  is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date based on their fair values 
the per share fair value of the common stock issued by integrys energy group for the acquisition of pec was determined by using the average market value of integrys energy group s common stock over a five day period  beginning two days before the announcement date of the merger 
as integrys energy group announced its intent to sell pep at the time of the closing of the merger  the pep assets and liabilities were reported at estimated fair value less costs to sell 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
assumptions may be incomplete  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the validity of such assumptions  estimates  or actual results 
as discussed below within asset impairment  a significant amount of goodwill resulted from these acquisitions  which requires impairment testing on at least an annual basis 
goodwill was allocated to the various segments based on the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net identifiable assets 
in conjunction with the pec merger  a significant fair value estimate related to nonderivative commodity contracts and customer relationships  which were recorded as intangible assets at integrys energy services 
the intangible asset related to the contracts is being amortized into earnings as the contracts settle  and the intangible asset related to customer relationships is being amortized over the estimated lives of those relationships 
the amortization of these items had a negative impact on earnings in pgl  nsg  mgu  and merc are predominantly regulated utilities  therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 the carrying value of the majority of their assets and liabilities approximated fair value  and as such  did not change significantly as a result of applying purchase accounting 
asset impairment integrys energy group reviews certain assets for impairment as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  and sfas no 
the carrying value of goodwill by segment for the year ended december  was millions carrying value of goodwill wps pgl nsg merc mgu total gas segment integrys energy services balance at december  related to the acquisition of wisconsin fuel and light in related to the pec merger in related to the acquisition of the natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota in the goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually on april or more frequently when events or circumstances warrant based on the guidance of sfas no 
the test for impairment includes estimating the fair market value of each reporting unit using assumptions about future profitability 
key assumptions used in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate  long term growth rates  return on equity  financial forecasts  capital expenditures  and other factors 
a significant decrease in market values and or projected future cash flows could result in an impairment loss 
in  an after tax goodwill impairment loss of million was recognized for nsg  related to a decrease in forecasted results and worsening economic factors 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for further discussion of the impairment 
the review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to integrys energy services than to our other segments because of its lack of access to rate setting based on cost of service that is available to our regulated segments 
at december   the carrying value of integrys energy services property  plant  and equipment totaled million 
integrys energy group believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future market sales pricing  production costs  capital expenditures  and generation volumes and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
management s assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the primary estimates used at integrys energy services in the impairment analyses are future revenue streams  capital expenditures  environmental landscape  and operating costs 
a combination of inputs from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams 
integrys energy services forecasts future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs 
these estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the methodology defined in sfas no 
integrys energy services evaluates property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
sfas no 
requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
for assets held for sale  impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value or fair value less costs to sell if held for sale 
throughout  integrys energy services tested various power plants for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that a test was required in compliance with sfas no 
no material impairment charges were recorded in as a result of the recoverability tests 
results of past impairment tests may not necessarily be an indicator of future results given the nature of the accounting estimates involved  as discussed more fully above 
future results or changes in assumptions could result in an impairment 
receivables and reserves our regulated natural gas and electric utilities and integrys energy services accrue estimated amounts of revenues for services rendered but not yet billed 
estimated unbilled revenues are calculated using a variety of factors based on customer class 
at december  and  integrys energy group s unbilled revenues were million and million  respectively 
any difference between actual revenues and the estimates are recorded in revenue in the next period 
differences historically have not been significant 
with the exception of wps  integrys energy group records reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet 
at wps  the pscw follows the direct write off approach in rates rather than the allowance method  therefore  a regulatory asset is debited rather than an expense account when the reserve for uncollectible accounts is set up 
actual write offs at wps are charged directly to an expense account in lieu of the reserve account 
at the utilities  the reserves are based on known troubled accounts  historical experience  and other currently available evidence 
provisions for bad debt expense are affected by changes in various factors  including the impacts of the economy  commodity prices  and weather 
each quarter  the utilities evaluate the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the most current available information and adjust the reserves for changes in estimated probable accounts receivable losses 
integrys energy services calculates the reserve for potential uncollectible customer receivable balances by applying an estimated bad debt experience rate to each past due aging category and reserving for of specific customer receivable balances deemed to be uncollectible 
the basis for calculating the reserve for receivables from wholesale counterparties considers netting agreements  collateral  and guarantees 
if the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect  or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults  there could be significant changes to bad debt expense and the uncollectible reserve balance 
at december  and  integrys energy group s reserve for uncollectible accounts was million and million  respectively 
pension and other postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits  described in note  employee benefit plans  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plans  and earnings on plan assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates used in determining the projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and costs  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
integrys energy group s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods 
management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported annual pension cost on the income statement

d  selection of discount rates used for measuring defined benefit pension obligations and obligations of post retirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the yield curve is comprised of non callable or callable with make whole provisions  high quality corporate bonds with maturities between and years 
the included bonds are generally rated by moody s as aaa and aa with a minimum amount outstanding of million 
the expected annual benefit cash flows are discounted for each of integrys energy group s pension and retiree welfare plans using this yield curve  and a single point discount rate is developed matching each plan s expected payout structure 
integrys energy group establishes its expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns  as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios 
the assumed long term rate of return was in   and for   and  the actual rates of return on pension plan assets  net of fees  were   and  respectively 
the determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
cumulative gains and losses in excess of of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages 
changes in fair value are recognized over the subsequent five years for plans previously sponsored by wps  while differences between actual investment returns and the expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period for plans previously sponsored by pec 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are included in market related value 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered 
more information on health care cost trend rates can be found in note  employee benefit plans

regulatory accounting the electric and natural gas utility segments of integrys energy group follow sfas no 
 and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers  as authorized by our regulators 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  earnings at the utility segments  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the rate recovery period 
if recovery of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income 
if our regulated electric and natural gas utility segments or a separable portion of those segments would no longer meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
 we would discontinue its application as defined under sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of sfas no 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet  but rather would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred 
a write off of all of integrys energy group s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in an decrease in total assets and a decrease in total liabilities 
see note  regulatory assets and liabilities  for more information 
environmental activities relating to former manufactured gas operations integrys energy group s utility subsidiaries  their predecessors  and certain former affiliates operated facilities in the past at multiple manufactured gas plant sites for the purpose of manufacturing gas and storing manufactured gas 
the utility subsidiaries are accruing and deferring the costs incurred in connection with environmental activities at the manufactured gas plant sites pending recovery through rates or from other entities 
the amounts deferred include costs incurred but not yet recovered through rates and management s best estimates of the costs that the utilities will incur in investigating and remediating the manufactured gas sites 
management s estimates are based upon a probabilistic model and an ongoing review by management of future investigative and remedial costs 
management considers this policy critical due to the substantial uncertainty in the estimation of future costs with respect to the amount and timing of costs  and the extent of recovery from other potential responsible parties 
see note  commitments and contingencies  for further discussion of environmental matters 
tax provision as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance  which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in the consolidated income statements 
the interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty  since tax authorities may interpret them differently 
as of january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas as allowed under interpretation no 
 integrys energy group elected to change its method of accounting to record interest and penalties paid on income tax obligations as a component of income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the assumptions involved are supported by historical data  reasonable projections  and technical interpretations of applicable tax law and regulation across multiple taxing jurisdictions 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on integrys energy group s financial condition and results of operations 
see notes p income taxes  and  income taxes  for a discussion of accounting for income taxes 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
for our regulated operations  to the extent we are not recovering the effects of inflation  we will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions 
our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks and other significant risks integrys energy group has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk including regulatory recovery risk  interest rate risk  equity return and principal preservation risk  and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
integrys energy group is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries businesses and the environment in which we operate 
integrys energy group has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures  as further described below 
commodity price risk and regulatory recovery risk utilities the electric utilities of integrys energy group purchase natural gas and coal for use in power generation 
they also buy and sell power from the miso market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation 
prudent fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by uppco and by the wholesale electric operations and michigan retail electric operations of wps 
the costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utility subsidiaries are generally also recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms 
these recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities 
wps s wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations  but biennial rate cases with fuel adjustments have mitigated the year to year price risk 
for intra year price risk  a fuel window mechanism is used to recover costs resulting from significant price volatility 
under the fuel window  if actual fuel and purchased power costs deviate by more than from costs included in the rates charged to customers  a rate review can be triggered 
once a rate review is triggered  rates may be reset subject to pscw approval for the remainder of the year to recover or refund  on an annualized basis  the projected change in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
to manage commodity price risk  our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
in addition  the electric operations of wps and the natural gas operations of wps  pgl  nsg  and merc employ risk management techniques  which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps  futures  and options 
integrys energy services as part of its trading activities  integrys energy services seeks to generate profits from the volatility of the price of electricity by purchasing or selling various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts  options  financial transmission rights  and capacity contracts in established wholesale markets where integrys energy services has market expertise  under risk management policies set by management and approved by integrys energy group s board of directors 
integrys energy services also seeks to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its generation and customer contract portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments 
to measure commodity price risk exposure  integrys energy group employs a number of controls and processes  including a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
integrys energy services var calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its marketing and trading portfolio primarily natural gas and power positions  which also includes near term positions managed under its asset management strategy through tolling agreements with the merchant generating fleet 
the var calculation excludes the long dated positions created by owning merchant generation and associated coal  sulfur dioxide emission allowances  and other ancillary fuels 
additionally  financial transmission rights  renewable energy credits  and certain portions of long dated natural gas storage and transportation contracts are also excluded from the var calculation 
the capped downside nature of the risks and duration of these positions would result in a var that would not be representative of the actual exposure 
therefore  integrys energy services evaluates the exposures for these types of contracts by assessing the maximum potential loss of the positions which would represent the cost of the physical asset or the fixed demand charges for the contract 
var is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
in addition to var  integrys energy services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations  stress testing  and scenario based testing 
in conjunction with the var analysis  these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for integrys energy services risk exposure 
additionally  integrys energy services also uses volume limits and stop loss limits to limit its exposure to commodity price movements 
var has a number of limitations that are important to consider when evaluating the calculation results 
most importantly  var does not represent the maximum potential loss of the portfolio 
price movements outside of the relevant confidence levels can and do occur and may result in losses exceeding the reported var 
large short term price moves can be caused by catastrophic weather events or other drivers of short term supply and demand disruptions 
also  the holding period may not always be an adequate assessment of the timeframe to close out positions 
short term reductions in market liquidity could cause integrys energy services to hold positions open longer than anticipated  resulting in greater than predicted losses 
additionally  there are other risks not captured by the var metric including  but not limited to  the risk of customer and vendor nonperformance and the risks associated with the liquidity in the markets in which integrys energy services transacts 
customer and vendor nonperformance risk could result in bad debt losses  realized and unrealized losses on commodity contracts or increased supply costs in the event that contractual obligations of our counterparties are not met 
market liquidity risk refers to the risk that integrys energy services will not be able to efficiently enter or exit commodity positions 
integrys energy services var is calculated using non discounted positions with a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level  as well as a ten day  confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day or ten days  are normally distributed 
integrys energy services var calculation includes financial and physical commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options  as well as natural gas inventory  natural gas storage  and transportation contracts  to the extent such positions are significant  but excludes the positions mentioned above 
the var for integrys energy services trading portfolio at a confidence level and a one day holding period is presented in the following table millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the var for integrys energy services trading portfolio at a confidence level and a ten day holding period is presented below millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at each of the four quarter ends 
interest rate risk integrys energy group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
integrys energy group enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
integrys energy group may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
due to increases in short term borrowings in the last year  integrys energy group has increased its exposure to variable interest rates 
based on the variable rate debt of integrys energy group outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense by approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates  with no other changes for the remainder of the period 
equity return and principal preservation risk integrys energy group currently funds liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds 
the trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future costs for the plans and possible future required contributions for the pension plans 
integrys energy group monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
most of the employee benefit costs relate to integrys energy group s regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
during  integrys energy group closed its qualified pension plans to non union new hires  and to pgl s and nsg s union new hires 
in april  the plans will also be closed to uppco s union new hires 
this will reduce future exposure to equity return and principal preservation risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk integrys energy group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of operations owned and operated in canada and transactions denominated in canadian dollars for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity by integrys energy services 
in addition  integrys energy group has a japanese yen denominated term loan that matures on march  forward foreign exchange contracts are utilized to manage the risk associated with certain transactions denominated in canadian dollars  as well as the risk associated with the yen denominated loan 
integrys energy group s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk was not significant at december   or
