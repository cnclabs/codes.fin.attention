item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading creator of digital media services and software 
our mission is to deliver world class digital entertainment experiences music  games or video wherever and whenever consumers want them 
consumers use our services and software  such as rhapsody  realarcade  and realplayer to find  play  purchase  and manage free and premium digital content  including music  games  and video 
broadcasters  cable and wireless communication companies  media companies and enterprises  such as at t and verizon wireless in the us  vodafone in europe  and sk telecom in korea  use our digital media applications and services to create  secure and deliver digital media to pcs  mobile phones  portable music players and other consumer electronics devices and to provide entertainment services to their subscribers 
our strategy is to continue to develop technology that provides meaningful differentiation to our chosen markets in digital entertainment services  build a direct relationship with  and grow  our worldwide user base and use feedback from our customers to rapidly innovate and improve our products  and create strong business partnerships with device makers  media companies  service providers and other distribution channels and leverage those partnerships to drive scale and profitability 
we intend to continue to expand our products and services beyond the pc to mobile devices and to create compelling digital media experiences on a variety of entertainment devices 
we also intend to use our strong cash position to continue to seek acquisition opportunities to further our strategic initiatives  to make selective internal investments in new products or technologies and to enhance our competitive position 
in recent years  we have focused our acquisition efforts principally on the identification and acquisition of targets with technologies and products complementary to ours in order to accelerate and supplement our research and development efforts  to increase the distribution of our products and services into new geographies  to gain significant new customers and with existing or a reasonably expected ability to achieve profitability 
for example  our technology products and solutions business acquired widerthan in to obtain a new set of products and technologies including ringback tone and music on demand businesses for mobile carriers 
the widerthan acquisition also expanded our geographic reach into south korea and brought us a new relationship with sk telecom  a leading mobile carrier in south korea 
subsequent to our acquisition of widerthan  we acquired sony netservices in to expand our presence in europe for our ringback tone and music on demand products and to enhance our strategic relationship with many of the larger vodafone operating companies 
similarly  in our games business  we acquired zylom in to expand our presence in europe and trymedia in to expand the distribution of our casual games to a wide variety of new customers through trymedia s existing syndication business 
we have recently focused our efforts on building our music and consumer businesses through internal initiatives  third party distribution and strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies 
through our agreement with verizon wireless  we have expanded our rhapsody subscription music service  which is provided through rhapsody america  into the mobile carrier market 
we have also increased our focus on free to consumer products and services  such as providing free music streaming for top music websites and downloadable games monetized through advertising 
these products and services generate advertising revenue and are also designed to increase the exposure of our paid digital music and games products and services to consumers 
as a result  combined revenue in our music and consumer segments grew and during the years ended december  and  respectively  and we recorded the highest total annual revenue in our history in each year 
the growth in our consumer businesses  as compared with  was driven primarily by increased revenue from our games and music businesses  which was aided by the inclusion of the operating results from our acquisition of trymedia  completed in april this growth was partially offset by a decline in revenue in our media software and services business from to  due primarily to a decline in revenue from our superpass subscription service 
our technology products and solutions business consists primarily of application service provider asp services  which include ringback tones  music on demand  video on demand and messaging services  system software sales and intellectual property licensing 
our traditional system software sales have been negatively impacted primarily by the competitive efforts of microsoft  which bundles its competing technology with its 
table of contents market leading operating systems and server software 
in december  we filed suit against microsoft in us district court to redress what we believed were illegal  anticompetitive practices by microsoft 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement with microsoft regarding the settlement of all antitrust disputes worldwide and two commercial agreements related to our digital music and casual games businesses 
the settlement agreement provided for cash payments to us totaling approximately million  the final installment of which we received in the quarter ended march  the transactions under the commercial agreements have also concluded 
while the payments we received under the settlement agreement have significantly enhanced our cash position and impact the comparability of our overall results of operations in and the results of operations in  we do not expect that the completion of microsoft s obligations under the settlement agreement and the commercial agreements will materially impact our prospects or business strategies in future periods 
in response to the slowing growth of our system software sales business  we began to shift our focus to growing our asp services  which we significantly enhanced by acquiring widerthan in we believe that the transition to an asp business model will create a more stable  recurring and scalable revenue stream compared with our traditional system software license sales model 
in addition  we have continued to de emphasize our systems integration business  including the sale of systems integration services to sk telecom  primarily because it has lower margins and does not generate consistent recurring revenue streams  which does not fit our current business model 
this shift away from the systems integration business to our asp business resulted in a slight decrease in our technology products and solutions revenue  including a decline in revenue from sales of systems integration services to sk telecom  in compared with this decrease was partially offset by increases in revenue from our asp business 
in may  we announced our intent to separate our casual games business into an independent company and to distribute shares of the newly created games company to our shareholders 
we also announced that we may precede the spin off with an initial public offering and sale of up to of the shares of the new games company 
in february  we announced that we postponed work with our outside advisors  stopped external spending on the proposed transaction and wrote off the capitalized transaction related costs in the fourth quarter of while we still intend to create a separate games company  current conditions do not support a separation transaction 
we believe our operating results for the second half of were impacted by  and our operating results in future periods may continue to be impacted by  the uncertainty and adverse conditions in the economy 
the economic downturn has resulted in a decline in overall consumer and corporate spending  declines in consumer access to credit  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  declines in the value of assets and increased liquidity risks  all of which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the digital entertainment products and services we provide may be considered discretionary items for consumers 
as a result  we may experience decreases in consumer demand for our products and services  including the products and services we provide to our business customers who sell them to their subscribers  increased price sensitivity by consumers  softening of new subscriber sign ups and changes in consumers use of credit cards  which is how they pay for our services 
any of these changes could materially adversely affect our revenue in future periods 
in addition  we may continue to experience a decline in advertising revenue as corporate spending has decreased due to the contracting economy 
we also expect our revenue to continue to be impacted by the increased volatility in foreign exchange rates  particularly if the us dollar continues to gain strength against the euro and the korean won 
the continued downturn in the economy may result in additional impairments to our assets in future periods  particularly goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets 
economic conditions may also negatively impact our liquidity due to declines in interest income  increased risk that we may not be able to access cash balances held in us or foreign financial institutions or that our investments in debt securities issued by financial institutions may become worthless if such financial institutions nationalize or fail  and decreased ability to sell the securities or institutional money market funds we hold as short term investments 
these risks and the potential impact of these risks on our financial condition and results of operations are discussed further above in risk factors risks related to our business in general 
if any of these risks are realized  we may experience a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods

revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the following authoritative literature aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements  sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
generally we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  the product or services have been delivered and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
consumer subscription products are paid in advance  typically for monthly  quarterly or annual periods 
subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the related subscription period 
revenue from sales of downloaded individual music tracks  albums and games are recognized at the time the music or game is made available  digitally  to the end user 
we recognize revenue under the residual method for multiple element software arrangements when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  under sop no 
under the residual method  at the outset of the arrangement with a customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of the arrangement s undelivered elements such as post contract support pcs  and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered  such as software licenses 
vsoe for pcs is established on standard products for which no installation or customization is required based upon amount charged when pcs is sold separately 
for multiple element software arrangements involving significant production  modification  or customization of the software  which are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sop no 
 vsoe for pcs is established if customers have an optional renewal rate specified in the arrangement and the rate is substantive 
we have arrangements whereby customers pay one price for multiple products and services and in some cases  involve a combination of products and services 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the individual deliverables in accordance with eitf issue no 
in the event that there is no objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the delivered items  the revenue recognized upon delivery is the total arrangement consideration less the fair value of the undelivered items 
we apply significant judgment in establishing the fair value of multiple elements within revenue arrangements 
we recognize revenue on a gross or net basis in accordance with eitf issue no 
in many arrangements  we contract directly with end user customers  are the primary obligor and carry all collectability risk 
in such arrangements we report the revenue on a gross basis 
in some cases  we utilize third party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers and carry no collectability risk 
in such instances we report the revenue on a net basis 
revenue generated from advertising appearing on our websites and from advertising included in our products is recognized as revenue as the delivery of the advertising occurs 
music publishing rights and music royalty accruals 
we must make estimates of amounts owed related to our music publishing rights and music royalties for our domestic and international music services 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our expense for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under copyright law  we may be required to pay licensing fees for 
table of contents digital sound recordings and compositions we deliver 
copyright law generally does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by voluntary negotiations among the parties or  for certain compulsory licenses where voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful  by arbitration 
there are certain geographies and agencies for which we have not yet completed negotiations with regard to the royalty rate to be applied to the current or historic sales of our digital music offerings 
our estimates are based on contracted or statutory rates  when established  or management s best estimates based on facts and circumstances regarding the specific music services and agreements in similar geographies or with similar agencies 
while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
recoverability of deferred costs 
we defer costs on projects for service revenue and system sales 
deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems  as defined in individual customer contracts  including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties 
we recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract 
for revenue recognized under the completed contract method  costs are deferred until the products are delivered  or upon completion of services or  where applicable  customer acceptance 
for revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method  costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation 
for revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract  costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing on the date of revenue recognition 
at each balance sheet date  we review deferred costs to ensure they are ultimately recoverable 
any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze the age of accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
similarly  we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
accrued loss on excess office facilities 
we made significant estimates in determining the appropriate amount of accrued loss on excess office facilities 
if we made different estimates  our loss on excess office facilities could be significantly different from that recorded  which could have a material impact on our operating results 
our original estimate has been revised in previous periods in response to changes in market conditions for commercial real estate in the area where the excess office facilities are located  or to reflect negotiated changes in sublease rates charged to occupying tenants 
impairment of investments 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in the fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
significant judgments and estimates must be made to assess whether an other than temporary decline in fair value of investments has occurred and to estimate the fair value of investments in privately held companies 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of any impairment charge if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  as well as amortizable intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
long lived assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a long lived asset is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its 
table of contents respective fair value  which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or at the appraised value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
valuation of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis  in our fourth quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates is less than the carrying value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  and loss of key personnel 
if we were to determine that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
judgment is required in determining our reporting units and assessing fair value of the reporting units 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  which we adopted as of january   stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility in our common stock price and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from the amounts recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we measured compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb no 
 when the exercise price of our employee stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
minority interests 
we record minority interest expense benefit which reflects the portion of the earnings losses of majority owned entities which are applicable to the minority interest partners in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements arb and eitf topic no 
d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities eitf d 
redeemable minority interests that are redeemable at either fair value or are based on a formula that is intended to approximate fair value follow our historical disclosure only policy for the redemption feature and the current redemption amount of the redeemable minority interests is disclosed on the face of the balance sheet 
redeemable minority interests that are redeemable at either a fixed price or are based on a formula that is not akin to fair value are reflected as an adjustment to income attributable to common shareholders based on the difference between accretion as calculated using the terms of the redemption feature and the accretion entry for a hypothetical fair value redemption feature with the remaining amount of accretion to redemption value recorded directly to equity 
minority interest expense benefit is included within the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for and 
table of contents as of december  and  our minority interests solely related to redeemable minority interests in rhapsody america 
see note for further discussion of the redeemable minority interest treatment 
accounting for gains on sale of subsidiary stock 
we account for any changes in our ownership interest resulting from the issuance of equity capital by consolidated subsidiaries as either a gain or loss in the statement of operations pursuant to sab no 
accounting for the sales of stock of a subsidiary 
sab no 
requires that the difference between the carrying amount of the parent s investment in a subsidiary and the underlying net book value of the subsidiary after the issuance of stock by the subsidiary be reflected as either a gain or loss in the statement of operations if the appropriate recognition criteria has been met or reflected as an equity transaction 
we have elected to reflect sab no 
gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income when the appropriate criteria have been met 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  the sales of stock in rhapsody america met the gain recognition criteria for all periods through september  and the gains from these sales were included in the consolidated statement of operations 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the gain recognition criteria in sab no 
were no longer met and the sales of ownership interests in rhapsody america were accounted for as equity transactions 
accounting for taxes collected from customers 
we collect various types of taxes from our customers  assessed by governmental authorities  which are imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions 
such taxes are recorded on a net basis and are not included in our net revenue 
accounting for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine current provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
each reporting period we must periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations and comprehensive income 
factors we consider in making such an assessment include  but are not limited to past performance and our expectation of future taxable income  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our investments and other assets 
we have not provided for us deferred income taxes or withholding taxes on certain non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in operations outside of the us if these amounts were distributed to the us  in the form of dividends or otherwise  we could be subject to additional us income taxes 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability or benefit on such earnings due to the availability of foreign tax credits and the complexity of the computation if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested

these products and services are sold and provided primarily through our distribution partners and the internet and we charge customers credit cards at the time of sale 
billings for subscription services typically occur monthly  quarterly or annually  depending on the service purchased 
during the first six months of  our music revenue growth slowed due primarily to continuing challenges facing our subscription music business  including low consumer awareness of subscription music services  apple s dominance of the portable mp player business  limited distribution of music devices that are compatible with our subscription services  and the persistent availability of unlicensed music content from peer to peer services 
in response  we have shifted our business strategy and marketing efforts toward new initiatives including the launches of rhapsody america s new online mp store and rhapsody subscription service with verizon wireless  as well as the development of music discovery services for consumer music 
table of contents websites operated by yahoo and mtvn 
these initiatives were launched on june  and contributed to an increase in the rate of growth of our music revenue for the six months ended december  additionally  as part of a strategic relationship between yahoo and us  yahoo music unlimited subscribers that chose to migrate to rhapsody s digital music service were converted from yahoo music unlimited subscribers to rhapsody subscribers during the year ended december  music revenue increased by million  or  during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  growth in revenue from our rhapsody subscription music service accounted for million of the increase for the year ended december  subscriber and related revenue growth were primarily driven by our launch of a new distribution channel with verizon wireless and the one time migration of yahoo music unlimited subscribers who chose to convert to our rhapsody music service 
an increase in the number of digital music tracks sold during the year ended december  contributed approximately million to the increase 
the increase in sales of digital music tracks was due primarily to the launch of rhapsody america s new mp music store on june  these increases were offset by a decline in revenue from our radiopass music subscription services of approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to a decline in subscribers to these services

technology products and solutions revenue decreased by million  or less than  during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the decrease during the year was due primarily to a decrease in systems integration revenue of approximately million  offset by an increase in revenue from application services provided to wireless carriers  including ringback tones  music on demand  inter carrier messaging  and video on demand services of approximately million 
table of contents during the year 
we have de emphasized our systems integration business  including sales of business integration services to sk telecom  primarily because it has lower margins and does not generate consistent recurring revenue streams  which does not fit our current business model 
as a result  we experienced a decline in systems integration revenue during the year due primarily to a decline in sales of our lower margin systems integration services to sk telecom 
the increase in revenue from our application services was primarily due to increased usage and the number of users of the services we provide

impairment of goodwill and long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and if an event or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during our fiscal fourth quarter 
a two step process is used to test for goodwill impairment under sfas the first step is to determine if there is an indication of impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its 
table of contents carrying value including existing goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value 
upon an indication of impairment from the first step  a second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment 
this involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities other than goodwill and comparing it to the carrying amount of goodwill 
we have four reporting units  music  technology products and solutions  games  and media software and services 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units for step one  we utilized a combination of income and market approaches 
the income approach  specifically a discounted cash flow methodology  included assumptions for  among others  forecasted revenues  gross profit margins  operating profit margins  working capital cash flow  growth rates and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
during the quarter ended december   the we revised our long term operating plan 
our operating plan was a significant input in evaluating the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill for possible impairment 
the expected impact resulting from the significant declines observed in the broader economy during the fiscal fourth quarter of were reflected in the plan 
additionally  in light of the uncertainty regarding the extent of future economic declines  we applied discount rates in our income approach that appropriately reflected the possibility that cash flows from future operations may not be fully realized 
as a result  it was determined that the carrying value for our games and technology products and solutions reporting units exceeded their respective fair values  indicating that goodwill within each reporting unit was potentially impaired 
no impairments were indicated under the first step for our music and media software and services reporting units 
as required  we initiated the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our games and technology products and solutions reporting units 
we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill for our technology products and solutions and games reporting units was less than the carrying value by approximately million and million  respectively  which was recorded as an impairment of goodwill during the quarter ended december  no impairments were recognized in either of the years ended december  or in accordance with sfas no 
 we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including operating and cash flow projections 
our operating plan was a significant input in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets 
in light of the uncertainty regarding the extent of future economic declines  we applied discount rates in our discounted cash flow analysis that appropriately reflected the possibility that cash flows from future operations may not be fully realized 
based on this assessment  we concluded that the net book value related to certain intangible assets exceeded the fair value attributable to such intangible assets 
as a result  we recorded charges of million as impairments of long lived assets within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in no such impairments were recognized in either or the impairment analysis for goodwill and long lived assets is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
significant or sustained declines in future revenue or cash flows  or adverse changes in our business climate  among other factors  could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis under sfas no 
and in future interim periods 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or long lived assets 
should the value of our goodwill or long lived assets become impaired  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring and other charges during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring and other charges of million 
included in this charge was million in severance costs resulting from workforce reductions 
we also 
table of contents recorded a charge of million related to the write down of capitalized transaction related costs associated with our plan to separate our games business from our company 
during the year ended december   we recorded a restructuring charge of million  primarily related to severance payments 
these charges were a result of workforce reductions and other realized synergies among our recent acquisitions 
severance charges accounted for the majority of the amount recorded 
no such amounts were incurred during the year ended december  loss on excess office facilities the accrued loss of million for estimated future losses on excess office facilities located near our corporate headquarters in seattle  washington at december   is shown net of expected future sublease income of million  which was committed under sublease contracts at the time of the estimate 
we regularly evaluate the market for office space in the cities where we have operations 
if the market for such space declines further in future periods  we may have to revise our estimates further  which may result in additional losses on excess office facilities

see notes to consolidated financial statements rhapsody america note 
other income  net increased during primarily due to minority interest in the net loss in rhapsody america and gain related to the sale of our interest in rhapsody america

income taxes during the years ended december    and  we recognized income tax expense of million  million  and million  respectively  related to us and foreign income taxes

the decrease of million in tax expense from the year ended december  to was primarily due to the change in income generated from the microsoft settlement 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered 
in making this assessment  many factors are considered including the current economic climate  our expectations of future taxable income  our ability to project such income  and the appreciation of our investments and other assets 
as of december   we have a valuation allowance of million 
the net change in valuation allowance since december  was million primarily due to the current economic environment in which the company is currently not certain about its ability to recognize deferred tax assets 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree  including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for periods beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r on our consolidated financial statements will largely be dependent on the size and nature of the business combinations completed after the adoption of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity within the consolidated balance sheets 
sfas requires that changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest shall be accounted for as equity transactions 
as a result  the gain on sales of interest in rhapsody america will no longer be recorded in the statement of operations  but will be reflected as a component of shareholders equity 
the requirements of sfas are effective for periods beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations except as noted above

the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  in the future  we may enter into cash or stock acquisition transactions or other strategic transactions that could reduce cash available to fund our operations or result in dilution to shareholders 
our principal commitments include office leases and contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be 
table of contents sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one non us government or non us agency issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates in our securities portfolio 
we conduct our operations in ten primary functional currencies the us dollar  the korean won  the japanese yen  the british pound  the euro  the mexican peso  the brazilian real  the australian dollar  the hong kong dollar  and the singapore dollar 
historically  changes in foreign economic conditions have not had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we currently do not hedge the majority of our foreign currency exposures and are therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we invoice our international customers primarily in us dollars  except in korea  japan  germany  france  the united kingdom and australia  where we invoice our customers primarily in won  yen  euros  pounds  and australian dollars  respectively 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from intercompany payables and receivables to and from our foreign subsidiaries 
the downturn in the economy could result in negative impacts to our liquidity arising from lower interest income in future periods due to the continued decline in interest rates  an increased risk that we may not be able to access cash balances held in us or foreign financial institutions or that investments in debt securities issued by financial institutions may be rendered worthless due to the nationalization or failure of such financial institutions  and an increased inability to sell the securities and the institutional money market funds we hold as short term investments 
if any of these risks are realized  we may experience a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had commitments to make the following payments less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands office leases other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations other contractual obligations primarily relate to minimum contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments for such liability 
we have a commitment to purchase million in advertising over the next five years from mtvn related to the rhapsody america venture 
the million is excluded from the table above as the timing and amount of these payments will vary 
off balance sheet arrangements our only significant off balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease obligations for office facility leases and other contractual obligations related primarily to minimum contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
future annual minimum rental lease payments and other contractual obligations are included in the commitment schedule above

all statements that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward looking statements

interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk from changes in market interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity investments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of high quality debt securities as specified in our investment policy 
investments in both fixed and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
additionally  a declining rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate  generating less interest income 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may be adversely impacted due to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we may incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our short term investments until maturity and the substantial majority of our short term investments mature within one year of purchase  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 
there have been no material changes in our investment methodology regarding our cash equivalents and short term investments during the year ended december  based on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash equivalents at december   a hypothetical increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately million

as of december   we had investments in voting capital stock of both publicly traded and privately held technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
our investments in publicly traded companies are accounted for as available for sale  carried at current market value and are classified as long term as they are strategic in nature 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary based on a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
for investments with publicly quoted market prices  these factors include the time period and extent by which its accounting basis exceeds its quoted market price 
we consider additional factors to determine whether 
table of contents declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as the investee s financial condition  results of operations  and operating trends 
the evaluation also considers publicly available information regarding the investee companies 
for investments in private companies with no quoted market price  we consider similar qualitative and quantitative factors as well as the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee 
based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances during  we determined that an other than temporary decline in fair value had occurred in one of our privately held investments resulting in an impairment charge of million to reflect changes in the fair value 
based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances during and  we determined that no additional other than temporary decline in fair value had occurred and therefore no impairment charges were recorded 
included in our short term investments balance is approximately million in debt securities issued by financial institutions  and we face the risk that these investments may be rendered worthless due to the nationalization or failure of such financial institutions 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct business internationally in several currencies 
as such  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arise in part from translation of the financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation  the re measurement of non functional currency assets  liabilities and intercompany balances into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  and us dollar denominated sales to foreign customers 
a portion of these risks is managed through the use of financial derivatives  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
generally  our practice is to manage foreign currency risk for the majority of material short term intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
these contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contract s inception 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the short term intercompany balances  these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not designate our foreign exchange forward contracts related to short term intercompany accounts as hedges and  accordingly  we adjust these instruments to fair value through results of operations 
however  we may periodically hedge a portion of our foreign exchange exposures associated with material firmly committed transactions  long term investments  highly predictable anticipated exposures and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
some of our unhedged exposures are reconciled through our statement of operations on a mark to market basis each quarter  so to the extent we continue to experience adverse economic conditions  we may record losses related to such unhedged exposures in future periods that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our foreign currency risk management program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
in aggregate  our foreign currency denominated assets are greater than our foreign currency denominated liabilities 
primarily as a result of the us dollar strengthening against the korean won and euro in  we recorded a reduction to our reported net assets of approximately million as reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  additionally  we have cash balances denominated in foreign currencies which are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
the majority of our foreign currency denominated cash is held in korean won and euros 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the korean won and euro relative to the us dollar from december  would result in an unrealized gain or loss of approximately million 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material for the years ended december    and
