risk factors 
industry background us active trader market an active trader in the united states has been defined by celent communications in a february research report online brokerages trends and developments the online world changes investing yet again as one who trades on average at least times per month  or times per year 
celent estimates that out of the estimated to million online brokerage accounts in the united states  a little less than  to  of those accounts meet that definition 
similarly  a november research report by fox pitt  kelton characterized active equities traders as those who tend to trade from to times a month  with account balances in the  to  range  and who utilize margin to some degree in their trading 
a january research report by keefe  bruyette woods  which estimated the total number of online accounts to be million  indicated that about  or million  of those accounts are active trader accounts  and that such active trader accounts generate more than of the total revenue generated by all online brokerage accounts 
the celent report made several general observations about the current state of the retail online trader market 
the report noted that as poor markets and declining numbers of advisors push investors toward a self service environment  online brokerages are positioning themselves to take advantage of future growth and that firms continue to enter the space as dedicated or stand alone online brokerage providers  which is the model we adopted when we launched our online brokerage offering in the report also noted that derivatives  specifically equity options  futures and foreign exchange  are all establishing a growing presence in the online brokerage world  and there continues to be a move to more sophisticated investment products  which is being supported by the 
table of contents improvements of online trading platforms in terms of capabilities and trading sophistication 
the report suggests that the accelerated growth of investment self service  both despite and as result of the massive market declines of  may be the harbinger of even more rapid growth over the next few years for online brokerage firms  and notes that today the typical online brokerage client has multiple accounts  averaging three to four  and  more often than not  no longer utilizes a traditional full service brokerage account 
in addition to the trades at least ten times a month threshold  we believe an active trader is defined as one who tends to be more self directed and relies less on advice  favors sophisticated products such as options  futures and foreign currencies  particularly those which exhibit a large degree of short term price volatility  understands and creates more complex and opportunistic strategies that require advanced tools and execution platforms  is comfortable using leverage to enhance returns  and is sensitive to commissions and trading fees 
us institutional trader market we see the institutional trader market in the united states  as it relates to potential customer relationships for electronic brokerage firms like tradestation securities  consisting of buy side firms such as certain hedge funds  money managers  commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators  registered investment advisers who use short term trading strategies  and certain proprietary trading desks at large firms 
many believe that  now more than ever  buy side institutional traders have become less and less pleased with wall street traditional sell side brokerage firms and are moving  to one degree or another  towards using execution management systems ems s to execute themselves their portfolio managers trading decisions 
a january bear stearns report states that the impact of financial technology on the securities markets cannot be understated  noting that the technologies originally developed to give the day trader the ability to trade with professionals is now  ironically  being targeted at institutional customers by most brokerage firms 
institutional trading currently represents a small percentage of the company s brokerage revenues and we do not expect significant revenue or account growth in this market in the foreseeable future unless we successfully acquire  or establish a successful strategic licensing or joint venture relationship with  an established ems brokerage firm or technology 
non us markets we believe there are market opportunities outside of the united states for tradestation at both the retail and institutional level 
we believe that opportunities with individual active traders exist in germany  italy  india and the pacific rim 
we believe that to compete fully and effectively for active traders in those markets  a trading platform needs to be connected to local or regional exchanges for both market data and order placement and execution  and there needs to be language translations of user materials  acceptance of local currencies to fund accounts  and local customer and technical support 
we plan  through both the efforts of our tradestation europe limited subsidiary  independent agents in local markets and potential strategic partnerships  to attempt to begin to penetrate these markets 
steps we have recently taken  such as adding to our brokerage platform market data for ice europe  xetra and five german regional exchanges  along with our eurex market data offering  are expected to increase the attractiveness of our platform in europe and to us traders who are interested in analyzing non us markets 
the next steps will be to find appropriate local brokerage firm partners with whom we can connect our platform for order placement and execution and who can offer local support 
according to celent s report  us investors interest in international equities has grown in recent years  as they are increasingly using international equities to diversify their portfolios and reduce risk  gain exposure to foreign currencies  and achieve superior returns offered by some emerging markets 
we also believe that our forex offering  which is an international market  can 
table of contents have appeal to forex traders worldwide if we can offer accounts that may be funded in local currencies or an otherwise acceptable currency exchange mechanism for customer accounts 
given our belief that we need to add local and regional market data and order execution to increase substantially the appeal of our offering to markets outside the us  our success in these markets will  in part  be determined by the quality and timing of these enhancements  which  in turn  will depend on the speed with which we are able to increase our product development and other needed resources and the priorities we assign to those resources to focus on the us market relative to us markets 
products and services overview tradestation our main product service offering is the tradestation electronic trading platform for self directed  active  including semi professional  traders and certain segments of the institutional buy side trader market 
tradestation does not provide investment or trading advice or recommendations  or recommend the use of any particular strategy  but rather enables the trader to design  test  optimize and automate his own  custom trading strategies 
tradestation is a registered trademark in the united states  australia  canada  the european union  indonesia  korea  singapore and taiwan 
in addition to offering the tradestation electronic trading platform to the brokerage customers of our tradestation securities subsidiary  we offer  through our tradestation technologies subsidiary  tradestation subscriptions 
the difference between the tradestation electronic trading platform and the tradestation subscription service is that the subscription service does not include order execution or account management capabilities 
tradestation has  since its initial release as a strategy trading software program in  been our flagship product 
from until october it was marketed worldwide to institutional traders on a monthly subscription basis by telerate  inc as a premium tool for the telerate data feed service 
it has also served  and continues to serve  as a strategy trading platform for numerous third party trading software applications 
its state of the art technology empowers the trader to design and develop a rule based trading strategy based upon the trader s objective rules and criteria  test the potential profitability of that trading strategy against historical data  and then computer automate it to monitor the applicable market and alert the trader in real time or instantaneously place the trade order when the criteria of the trading strategy have been met and an order should  therefore  be placed 
the principal feature of tradestation that enables the trader to design and develop trading strategies is easylanguage 
easylanguage is a proprietary computer language we developed consisting of english like statements and trading terms which can be input by the trader to describe particular objective rules and criteria 
the trader then has considerable flexibility to modify and combine different trading rules and criteria  which ultimately result in the design of the trader s trading strategies 
easylanguage is also a registered trademark 
brokerage services tradestation securities principal offering today is online brokerage services covering equities principally stocks and etfs  equity and index options  financial and commodities futures principally electronic financial futures contracts  such as e mini s and futures options  and spot forex transactions through the tradestation electronic trading platform 
tradestation securities targeted customer base for brokerage services includes active  including semi professional  traders and certain institutional traders  such as 
table of contents hedge funds  money managers  investment advisors and proprietary trading desks who use short term trading strategies  where the decision maker is also the person placing the trade orders 
in addition to providing online services through the tradestation electronic trading platform  the brokerage firm offers personal support services by its registered trade desk representatives who execute customers orders through electronic order execution systems if the customer is for some reason unable or unwilling to place the order using his or her own computer 
having or using an electronic order execution system  whether accessed directly by the brokerage customer through the tradestation electronic trading platform or by a tradestation securities broker on behalf of the brokerage customer  means that both the online services and the firm s trading desks are connected to electronic equities  equity and index options  futures and forex market centers  market makers or dealers 
this system often results in the simplest  most direct and speediest execution of orders at the best available price 
with respect to pit traded futures contracts  tradestation is directly connected to its futures clearing agent s online execution system  which sends the order directly to the trading pit 
approximately of the company s futures trades are on the electronic futures exchanges 
with respect to forex deals  the tradestation electronic trading platform is seamlessly connected to a third party forex dealer s system for the placement of forex orders directly from the tradestation platform 
tradestation securities self clears for its active trader  and some of its institutional  equity securities accounts  including stock  etf  and equity and index option trades 
other institutional accounts for equity securities  and all futures accounts  are carried on a fully disclosed basis by the brokerage s clearing agents or are given order execution services on a dvp rvp basis for equities  or a give up basis for futures  in either case with the orders cleared and settled by the client s prime brokerage firm 
for forex deals  an unaffiliated forex dealer firm acts as principal counterparty for  and clears  all deals with the company s forex customers 
tradestation securities executes or delivers for execution its customers securities  futures and forex transactions on an agency basis only  as opposed to a principal basis 
that is  it acts as the agent for its customers directly in the market 
when brokerage firms perform transactions on a principal basis  they are permitted to accept a customer s order to purchase  purchase the securities in the market for the brokerage firm  and then sell the securities to the customer  or otherwise act as counterparty to the customer s transaction 
tradestation securities does not do this 
it charges only an agreed upon commission and does not earn income from marking up or marking down  or sharing in spreads relating to  its customers securities  futures or forex transactions 
software products and services in december  we launched the tradestation electronic subscription service which replaced the electronic subscription services we had been offering since our october acquisition of window on wallstreet 
the tradestation electronic subscription service includes our award winning strategy trading features and functions  streaming real time charts and quotes  streaming news  state of the art analytical charting  and all other features included in the tradestation electronic trading platform other than trade order placement and other trading or brokerage related features or services 
effective may   the tradestation electronic subscription service was offered to new subscribers at the monthly rate of and to legacy customers who had upgraded at a monthly rate of 
we evaluate our approach to subscription fee pricing on an ongoing basis 
tradestation both as a subscription service and as a brokerage account trading platform also offers our optionstation and radarscreen functions and features 
optionstation  also an award winning technology  is an options trading analysis product for equity  index and futures options that enables traders to explore options trading strategies 
radarscreen enables traders to scan securities markets to identify potential buying or selling opportunities based upon the traders own trading strategies 

table of contents we ceased marketing our legacy software products in may and ceased marketing our subscription software services in december accordingly  in  and and  we expect  for the foreseeable future  our brokerage operations produced  and should continue to produce  most of our revenues 
in  and  revenues from brokerage services consisting primarily of brokerage commissions and fees and net interest income accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total consolidated net revenues  and software products and services accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total consolidated net revenues over that three year period 
sales and marketing our marketing in consisted principally of print advertising in active trader  futures  sfo  and technical analysis of stocks commodities magazines  direct mail and e mail  sales seminars  banner and keyword search advertising on financial web sites  our web sites  and television advertising on financial news channels 
the mix and frequency of television  print  web site  direct mail and in person marketing methods that we use to try to achieve results will likely be continually modified as we test and use such methods and mixtures and analyze and interpret the results 
most of our brokerage accounts are opened by prospects who respond to our advertising either by calling a sales associate or completing and submitting an online account application 
the majority of our account applications are submitted online 
as of december   all salespeople were compensated on purely a commission basis 
we plan to implement a new compensation program for our salespeople during the first half of under this new program  salespeople who assist in account openings from applications that are submitted online or result from referrals are compensated by a base salary and quarterly bonuses depending on performance during each quarter  and salespeople who assist in opening accounts from calls received in response to advertising or otherwise expend greater efforts to have the account opened are paid in commissions based on the trading activity of those accounts over the first twelve months following account funding by the new customer 
our sales people do not have any involvement in trading activity in our customers accounts once the accounts are opened 
revenues derived from customers outside of the united states for the years ended december   and  were approximately  and less than  respectively 
international revenues are collected in us dollars 
we currently conduct no marketing  sales or other operations  and maintain no assets  outside of the united states  other than relating to our operations in london via our united kingdom subsidiary  tradestation europe limited 
strategic relationships clearing services 
our brokerage firm s clearing services for many of our institutional securities accounts  and for all futures accounts  are currently provided by jp morgan clearing corp  and jp o brien associates  inc  respectively  pursuant to industry standard clearing agreements 
our server farms have direct connectivity with all major us equities  options and futures exchanges  so we do not  except in limited cases  such as futures pit trading  use our clearing firms for execution services 
forex deal services 
our forex deal services are currently provided through an arrangement with gain capital group  inc forex customers design  test  optimize and automate their forex strategies  including the placement of their orders  using tradestation  then  when a deal order is placed  gain capital s electronic dealer system processes the order and gain capital acts as counterparty principal with respect to the execution and clearing of each forex deal 

table of contents technology development we believe that our success depends  in large part  on our ability to offer unique  internet based trading technologies with state of the art order execution technologies  and continuously enhance those technologies  as well as develop and implement well designed and user friendly web sites 
to date  we have relied primarily on internal development of our products and services 
in  and  technology development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   our technology development team was comprised of people  compared to people as of december   an increase 
we plan to increase our technology development headcount significantly in  but there can be no assurance that we will succeed in significantly increasing our technology development headcount or that  if we do  such increase will result in better or more rapidly developed products or services  or better performance financial and otherwise  by the company 
we view our technology development cycle as a four step process to achieve technological feasibility 
the first step is to conceptualize in detail the defining features and functions that we believe our targeted market requires from the product or service  and to undertake a cost benefit analysis to determine the proper scope and integration of such features and functions 
once the functional requirements of the product or service have been determined  the second step is to technically design the product or service 
the third step is the detailed implementation  or engineering  of this technical design 
the fourth step is rigorous quality assurance testing to ensure that the final product or service generally meets the functional requirements determined in the first step 
several refinements are typically added and tested in the quality assurance phase of development 
once this process is completed  technological feasibility has been achieved and the working model is available for release to our customers 
near the end of  we began to implement a new approach to our product development  which seeks to synthesize better the functions of code engineering  quality assurance and product management using a multi department team approach  with the goal of breaking down complex  long term projects into smaller  more manageable components with shorter release cycles  thus identifying development issues earlier in the process and bringing higher quality products to market more rapidly 
the market for strategy trading software tools  streaming real time market data and news services  and online order execution services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards in computer hardware  software architecture  programming tools and languages  operating systems  database technology and information delivery systems  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements  as well as technical consolidation of products and services 
our success will depend  in part  upon our ability to develop and maintain competitive technologies and to develop and introduce new products  services and enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner that meets changing conditions such as evolving customer needs  existing and new competitive product and service offerings  emerging industry standards  changing technology  and increased capacity and stability requirements as we grow our business and as minimum customer acceptability standards for capacity and stability increase in our industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop  introduce and market  on a timely basis  if at all  products  services or enhancements that respond to changing market conditions or that will be accepted by customers 
any failure by us to anticipate or to respond quickly or effectively to changing market conditions  or any significant delays in the introduction of new products and services or enhancements  could cause customers to delay using  or decide against the use of  our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents customer services and support and training we provide customer services and support and product use training in the following ways customer services and support 
telephone account and technical support service is provided to brokerage customers through a trained customer service team 
advanced easylanguage consulting services services that technically assist customers in the use of easylanguage to write the customers own trading strategies are available from internal resources and from unaffiliated  independent easylanguage consultants 
a substantial amount of technical support information is also provided on our web sites 
product use training 
we consider user education important to try to help our customers increase their abilities to use our products and services fully and effectively  and to improve customer account retention 
the majority of our training materials consist of extensive online documentation and technical assistance information on our web sites  including online tutorials  as well as in person training seminars  so that our customers may learn to use and take full advantage of the sophisticated technology of the tradestation electronic trading platform 
the tradestation 
com support center includes access to an interactive community for active traders who engage or have interest in the development  testing and use of objective trading strategies 
the community sometimes known in the industry as social networking provides numerous discussion forums on a variety of topics related to strategy development and technical trading  as well as tradestation product and service features  articles about trading from industry leaders  and a library of strategy indicators  rules and components written in our proprietary easylanguage  many of which are donated by third parties 
competition the market for online brokerage services is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there appears to be substantial consolidation in the industry 
we believe consolidation is occurring in the four major online execution markets for active traders equities  equity and index options  futures and forex meaning that  contrary to specializing in offering services for only one of those market instruments  more and more firms are offering or plan to offer three or four of those services 
with our offering of online trading services for all four of these markets  we have embraced this consolidation 
also  as a result of price pressure  unused infrastructure capacity at the largest online brokerage firms  and the desire of the larger firms to acquire sophisticated electronic trading technologies  there have been numerous acquisitions in our industry  mostly by larger firms that are seeking to increase their ability to compete on both quality and price  and to expand their product offering to include more derivatives 
we believe that competition  as well as consolidation  will continue to increase and intensify in the future 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control  including price pressure  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by us and our competitors  our ability to design and support efficient  materially error free internet based systems  market conditions  such as recession and volatility  the size of the active trader market today and in the future  the extent to which institutional traders are willing to use electronic brokerage services offered by firms that have traditionally served mostly retail customers  product and service functionality  data availability and cost  execution and clearing costs  ease of use  reliability  customer service and support  and sales and marketing decisions and efforts 

table of contents we face direct competition from several publicly traded and privately held companies  principally online brokerages and futures commission merchants  including providers of electronic order execution services 
our competitors include the many online brokerages currently active in the united states  some of which offer both equities including equity and index options and futures brokerage services  including charles schwab co  e trade securities  fidelity brokerage services  interactive brokers  optionsxpress  scottrade financial services  td ameritrade  and thinkorswim td ameritrade has announced that it will acquire thinkorswim 
virtually all online brokerage firms are focused on attracting and retaining active traders  who are the most valuable segment of their online trader customer base 
the larger firms  although some are trying to expand more into the derivatives markets  particularly equity options  focus mostly on equities investors 
competitors specifically or heavily focused on equity and index options traders include interactive brokers  optionsxpress and thinkorswim 
firms focused heavily on futures traders include retail divisions and or introducing broker networks of calyon  the fimat group  interactive brokers  mf global formerly man financial and rj o brien  and those heavily focused on retail forex include fxcm  gain capital  gft and interactive brokers 
of all of the competitors or potential competitors named above  interactive brokers appears to be the one that is most  like tradestation  focused on offering sophisticated electronic brokerage services for equities  equity and index options  futures and forex to the active trader market 
even though we have consistently been rated as one of the best online brokerage firms in the united states  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such ratings  be rated that highly in the future  compete effectively with our competitors  adequately educate potential customers about the benefits our products and services provide  retain customers  or continue to offer such products and services 
many of our existing and potential competitors  which include large  online discount and traditional national brokerages and futures commission merchants  and financial institutions that are focusing more closely on online services  including electronic trading services for active traders  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base than do we 
further  there is the risk that larger financial institutions  which offer online brokerage services as only one of many financial services  may decide to use extremely low commission pricing or free trades as a loss leader to acquire and accumulate customer accounts and assets to derive interest income and income from their other financial services 
we do not offer other financial services  and have no plans to do so  therefore  such pricing techniques  should they become common in our industry  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business model 
generally  competitors may be able to respond more quickly or effectively to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
we believe we need to increase our technology development resources to improve the quality of our offering  automate and improve certain account opening and customer support services  and the pace at which we release new features  enhancements  products and services 
there can be no assurance that our efforts in this regard will succeed  or that existing or potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those developed and offered by us or adapt more quickly to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing customer requirements  or that we will be able to timely and adequately complete the implementation  and appropriately maintain and enhance the operation  of our business model 
recently  some of our larger 
table of contents competitors have been adding or emphasizing rule based or strategy trading products and features to the active trader market 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins  failure to obtain any significant market share  or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property our success is and will be heavily dependent on proprietary software technology  including certain technology currently in development 
we view our software technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we currently have two formal patent applications pending for the tradestation trading platform  and own two patents that cover what we believe to be important product features that have been incorporated into tradestation 
with respect to the pending patent applications  there can be no assurance that we will obtain patents broad enough in scope to have value  or obtain them at all 
we also have registered copyright rights in our easylanguage dictionary and documentation and tradestation software 
we have obtained trademark registrations for the tradestation mark in the united states  australia  canada  the european union  indonesia  korea  singapore and taiwan 
we have obtained registrations for the optionstation mark in the united states  canada and the european union 
we have obtained registrations for the easylanguage mark in the united states and the european union 
we have obtained registrations in the united states for the marks activitybar  positiongraphs  powereditor  probabilitymap  radarscreen  test before you trade and other marks 
we use an online subscription agreement for our internet trading software and data services between tradestation technologies and each of the users whether the users are brokerage customers or monthly subscribers in order to protect our copyrights and trade secrets and to prevent such users from commercially exploiting such copyrights and trade secrets for their own gain 
since these licenses are not physically signed by the licensees  it is possible their enforceability is limited under certain state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties copy or otherwise obtain  use or exploit our software or technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our software technology is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software technology exists 
piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the internet 
in addition  effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries  including some in which we may attempt to expand sales efforts 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
we do not believe that we are infringing  or that any technology in development will infringe  the intellectual property rights of others 
however  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted by our competitors or others  and  if asserted  there can be no assurance that they would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents to the extent that we acquire or license a portion of the software or data included in our products or services from third parties some data and software are licensed from third parties  or market products licensed from others generally  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such acquired or licensed software or data technology 
software patent infringement cases in financial service industries are becoming more frequent  and we may be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
in the future  litigation will likely be necessary to establish  define  enforce  defend and protect patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
any such litigation would likely be costly and divert management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  which could be expensive  or prevent us from selling our products or services or using our trademarks  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation our brokerage subsidiary  tradestation securities  is subject to extensive securities and futures industry regulation under both federal and state laws as a broker dealer with respect to its equities and equity and index options business and as a futures commission merchant with respect to its futures and forex business 
broker dealers and futures commission merchants are subject to regulations covering all aspects of those businesses  including sales methods  trade practices  use and safe keeping of customers funds and securities  clearing  processing and settlement of trades  and arrangements with clearing houses  exchanges and clearing corporations  capital structure  cash deposit or escrow requirements or their equivalent  record keeping  regulatory reporting  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision 
to the extent tradestation securities solicits orders from customers or makes investment recommendations which it currently does not  it is subject to additional rules and regulations governing  among other things  sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to its customers 
tradestation securities mode of operation and profitability may be directly affected by additional legislation  changes in rules promulgated by the sec  finra  nyse  cftc  nfa  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  dtcc  occ  various securities and futures exchanges  and other self regulatory associations and organizations  and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and laws  particularly any changes focused on online brokerages that target an active trader customer base or market the concepts of rule based trading  strategy trading or trading systems  simulated results from historical tests or paper trading of strategies  or strategy automation 
as a result of the current economic and market crises  the recent discovery of major wall street fraud scandals  and the stated intentions of our government and regulators  we believe there is a high likelihood that there will be a restructuring of the regulations that affect our business  new and modified regulations will be enacted  and enforcement of regulations will be broader and more stringent than in the past 
there is no way to predict the effect  if they occur  these changes will produce or how they may adversely affect the way we conduct our business or our revenues  costs  employee resources or financial results 
with respect to active trading  finra has adopted rules that require firms to provide customers with a risk disclosure statement about active trading 
further  finra and nyse s margin rules impose more restrictive requirements for pattern active traders 
governmental concern is focused in two basic areas that the customer has sufficient trading experience and that the customer has 
table of contents sufficient risk capital to engage in active trading 
a minimum equities account balance of  is required 
tradestation securities customer account documentation specifies that being an equities brokerage customer of tradestation securities is only for traders who have experience in active trading  are willing to risk considerable amounts of capital at least  and are interested in engaging in high risk  short term  speculative trading activity 
we believe our brokerage firm s minimum account opening requirements  as well as the extensive user education documentation and tutorials offered on our web site  are consistent with both the letter and the spirit of current rules and regulations concerning active trading 
with respect to the use of investment analysis software tools generally  and simulated performance reports of trading systems or strategies in particular  finra  the nfa and nyse have specific rules regarding how a broker dealer or futures commission merchant may market those tools to the public and to existing clients 
tradestation europe limited  which was formed to introduce brokerage customers from the european union to tradestation securities  is authorized and regulated by the fsa  and  in using its european passport to conduct such business throughout countries in the european economic area  is subject to the marketing  solicitation and other customer protection rules in effect in each country in which it conducts such business 
the sec  finra  nyse  cftc  nfa  fsa and other self regulatory associations and organizations sros and state and foreign securities commissions and agencies can censure  fine  enjoin  suspend  expel or issue cease and desist orders to a broker dealer or futures commission merchant or any of its officers or employees 
for information about certain recent and pending regulatory inquiries and actions  see item legal proceedings 
marketing campaigns by tradestation securities to bring brand name recognition to its services and to promote the benefit of those services  such as the tradestation electronic trading platform and its various features  are regulated by finra and nfa  and all marketing materials must be reviewed by an appropriately licensed tradestation securities principal prior to release  and must conform to standards articulated by the sec  finra and nfa 
finra or the nfa may request that revisions be made to marketing materials  and can impose certain penalties for violations of its advertising regulations  including censures or fines  a requirement of advance regulatory approval of all advertising  the issuance of cease and desist orders  and the suspension or expulsion of a broker dealer or futures commission merchant or any of its officers or employees 
the sec  finra  nyse  cftc  nfa  dtcc and occ and various other regulatory associations and organizations have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital or cash deposit requirements and reserves by securities broker dealers and futures commission merchants 
net capital is the net worth of the regulated company assets minus liabilities  less additional deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it must cease conducting business and  if it does not do so  it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec or the cftc and suspension or expulsion by finra  nyse or the nfa  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation 
tradestation securities is registered as a broker dealer in every us state and the district of columbia and it is subject to regulation under the laws of those jurisdictions  including registration requirements and being subject to sanctions if a determination of misconduct is made 
recently  several states  including florida where the company is headquartered  have been considering new or modified legislation that could increase the power of state regulatory authorities to sanction or suspend a brokerage firm that fails to comply with regulatory requirements or experiences adverse results in customer arbitrations 
there is no way to predict the effect  if they occur  these changes may produce or how they may adversely affect our business

global economic conditions may impact our stock price in the second half of and continuing into  the us securities markets experienced significant price fluctuations 
the market prices of securities of companies in the financial services sector were particularly volatile and the market price of our common stock decreased significantly during that period 
reduced confidence in the economy in general  or in the stability of the financial services sector  may further negatively impact the market price of our common stock 

table of contents there are several factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which could result in significant volatility in our stock price quarterly revenues and operating results of tradestation group have fluctuated significantly in the past  and our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future 
causes of such significant fluctuations may include  but are not limited to the uncertain correlation between prolonged market volatility and average revenue trades per account despite high market volatility in early  our average trades per account were lower than they were in the first nine months of  further negative changes in the condition of the securities and futures markets  and the financial markets and economy generally which could cause us to experience lower revenues  net income and earnings per share  general economic and market factors  including further negative changes in the condition of the securities and futures markets  and the financial markets and economy generally  that affect active trading and brokerage revenues  including trade volume  market volatility  market direction or trends  the level of confidence and trust in the markets  and seasonality summer months and holiday seasons typically being slower periods  changes in interest rates  most notably the federal funds target and daily rates of interest a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from interest income  and recent decreases in short term rates have had and are expected to continue to have a material negative impact on the interest income component of our brokerage revenues the federal funds average daily and target rates of interest determine the amount of interest income received on customer account balances and affect the rates charged for account borrowings since there are relatively few  if any  costs associated directly with interest income  such impacts  if material  will also materially impact our net income and earnings per share  the company s ability or lack thereof  based upon market or economic conditions  the level of success of its marketing and product development and enhancement efforts  product and service quality and reliability  competition including both price and quality of offering competition  which are intense and other factors  to achieve significant  or any  net increases in daily average revenue trades darts  brokerage accounts and brokerage commissions and fees sequentially or year over year for example  tradestation s darts and its net revenues decreased sequentially from first to second quarter and net account growth slowed in the third quarter  and these and other items may decrease sequentially or year over year in subsequent periods  with respect to net new customer accounts  the company s ability or lack thereof to maintain or increase the rate of quarterly gross account additions and to control the rate of quarterly account attrition  particularly in current market and economic conditions  including recession  unemployment  high volatility and swings in volatility  and if those conditions worsen and or are prolonged we  in fact  expect account attrition to increase in  beginning with the second quarter

conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity our products and services are  and will continue to be  designed for customers who trade actively in the securities and financial markets 
to the extent that interest in active trading  or trading generally  decreases due to low trading volumes  lack of volatility  significant downward movement in the securities or financial markets  or negative market sentiment  or future tax law changes  recessions  depressions  wars  terrorism including cyberterrorism  or otherwise  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 
these risks have heightened considerably as a result of the current crises in our markets and economy  including the severe declines in the markets and rising unemployment 
also  unfavorable market conditions  such as those experienced in the fourth quarter of and  to date  the first quarter of  have  historically  seemed to severely negatively impact the share price of publicly held online brokerage firms  and also usually result in more losses for our customers  which could result in increases in quantity and size of errors or omissions or other claims that may be made against us by customers 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of those potential claims 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 

table of contents our industry is intensely competitive  which makes it difficult to attract and retain customers the markets for online brokerage services  trading software tools  and real time market data services are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
there has  historically  been substantial consolidation of those three products and services in the industry  as well as  more recently  consolidation of the types of financial instruments equities  equity and index options  futures and forex offered by firms 
there has also been consolidation of online brokerage firms generally  as well as intense price and quality competition 
we believe that competition from large online and other large brokerage firms and smaller brokerage firms focused on active traders  as well as consolidation  will continue 
recently  some of our larger competitors have been adding or emphasizing rule based or strategy trading products and features to focus more on the active trader market 
competition may be further intensified by the size of the active trader market  which is generally thought to be comprised of about of all online brokerage accounts 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control 
factors outside of our control include price pressure on transactional commissions  monthly platform fees and interest rates offered to customers for both credit balances and account borrowings  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by our competitors including strategy back testing and automation capabilities  market conditions  such as recession and unemployment  the size of the active trader market today and in the future  data availability and cost  and exchange and third party execution and clearing costs 
factors over which we have more control  but which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties with respect to our ability to effectively compete  include timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements we develop  our ability to meet changing market demands for a unified  integrated trading platform that offers customers the ability to trade and manage portfolios containing multiple asset classes  our ability to design  improve and support materially error free and sufficiently robust internet based systems  ease of use of our products and services  reliability of our products and services  and pricing decisions and other sales and marketing decisions and efforts 
attrition of customer accounts and failure to maintain or increase the rate of growth of gross new account additions could materially adversely affect our operating results we consider an account to be inactive and exclude it when counting total brokerage accounts when it has less than a balance and has had no activity for more than consecutive days 
using this method  our account attrition for the third quarter was the highest we have experienced 
also  net account growth was significantly lower in the third quarter as compared to prior periods 
our current indications are that customer account attrition will increase in  beginning with the second quarter 
while there is no way to know for certain the specific reasons for these current indications concerning net account growth which is determined by the number  if any  that gross new account additions in a quarter exceed our customer account attrition in that quarter  we believe that the principal contributing factors include recent and current market and economic conditions  and there may be other reasons or factors 
our failure or inability to address the underlying issues or causes relating to increased attrition and a decrease in net account growth will likely result in decreased net revenues and net income 

table of contents systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers the online electronic trading platform we provide to our customers is based upon the integration of our sophisticated front end software technology with our equally sophisticated  internet based server farm technology 
our server farm technology is the foundation upon which online trading customers receive real time market data and place buy and sell orders 
however  in order for this technology to provide a live  effective  real time trading platform  it requires integration with real time market data  which are currently provided directly by the exchanges or by systems of independent third party market data vendors or other sources who obtain the data directly from the exchanges or  for forex  from inter bank markets  the electronic order book systems of electronic communication networks ecns  other liquidity providers and electronic systems offered by the exchanges  the clearing and back office systems we license from sungard for self clearance and of the clearance agents we use for trades that we do not self clear  and the forex deal order placement  settlement and back office systems of or licensed to the forex dealer firm which is responsible for all of our customers forex trades 
accordingly  our ability to offer a platform that enables the development  testing and automation of trading strategies and the placement  execution  clearance and settlement of buy and sell orders depends heavily on the effectiveness  integrity  reliability and consistent performance of all of these systems and technologies 
in particular  the stress that is placed on these systems during peak trading times  or by increased trade volume  or highly volatile markets  or upon increases by the exchanges or other market centers of the volume or capacity of data sent to our systems  could cause one or more of these systems to operate too slowly or fail 
outages and other system failures may also be caused by natural disasters and other events and circumstances beyond our control 
also  we do not maintain a seamless  redundant back up system to our order execution systems  which could materially intensify the negative consequences of any such difficulties  outages  errors or failures 
any major system failure or outage or series of frequent failures or outages  regardless of the cause  could result in the issuance of large credit amounts to customers  loss of accounts  reduced trading activity  loss of or diminished reputation and recognition in the industry  increased monetary costs and diversion of internal resources  regulatory inquiries  fines and sanctions  and other material adverse consequences 
we have had technical difficulties  outages  errors or failures in our electronic and software products  services and systems relating to market data  which do or may affect trading strategy signals and order placement triggers  some of which have occurred as recently as january and several times in these difficulties  outages  errors or failures may cause severe negative consequences to our business 
our failure or inability to address the underlying issues or causes relating to such problems  to adequately correct them and ensure they do not repeat particularly as the volume of market data received from the exchanges  or the volume of our client base s trading  requires increased  improved or different hardware and or software capacity  technology or company domain know how  or otherwise to ensure the stability  capacity  speed and accuracy of the trading platform s market data and order placement services  could materially negatively affect our reputation in the online trader market  causing increased attrition and a decrease in new accounts  and decreased net revenues and net income 
additionally  as a general matter not applicable only to our company  the integrity of these types of systems may be attacked by persons sometimes referred to as hackers who intentionally introduce viruses or other defects to cause damage  inaccuracies or complete failure 
also  cyberterrorism  should it occur  may significantly affect people s willingness to use internet based services  particularly ones that involve their personal or company s assets 
see our systems and our customers accounts may from time to time be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt operations  harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability below 

table of contents during a system outage or failure  our brokerage may be able to take orders by telephone  however  only associates with appropriate licenses  knowledge and experience can accept telephone orders and  given the relatively small size of our trade desk in relation to the number of customers we have and trades we process  an adequate number of associates likely would not be available to take customer calls in the event of a system outage or failure 
system delays  errors  outages and failures  depending upon how serious and how often they occur  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 
dependence upon outside data sources and clearing relationships creates risks outside of our control which may affect our ability to provide  and our cost to provide  market data and clearing and account services our business is currently dependent upon our ability to maintain contracts with private market and news data vendors and clearing and dealer firms in order to provide certain market data and news  and clearing and account services  respectively  to our customers 
we currently obtain nyse  american stock exchange amex  nasdaq  arca  deutsche borse  options price reporting authority opra  cme  cbot  new york mercantile exchange commodities exchange nymex comex  intercontinentalexchange ice  kansas city board of trade kcbot  minneapolis grain exchange mge  onechicago and eurex futures real time market data directly from those exchanges  and real time market depth displays directly from ecn book services  but obtain other market data such as forex data  fundamental data and news pursuant to non exclusive licenses from private data vendors who in turn obtain the data from exchanges or other sources 
clearing and back office account services for our brokerage customers are obtained from established clearing agents and  with respect to our self clearing operations  our software system licensing agreement with sungard 
for our forex services  we rely on a third party forex dealer firm for all trade activity account services 
the data and news contracts typically provide for royalties based on usage or minimums  the clearing contracts provide for monthly fixed and or transactional clearing fees and charges  and the contract with the forex dealer provides that we will not share in the spread made by the forex dealer in each deal 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or maintain contracts or acceptable clearing cost or vendor fee rates 
in fact  in we needed to quickly change our futures clearing agent in response to a substantial increase in our clearing costs imposed by our former futures clearing agent 
changes or  in some cases  the failure or inability to make changes in our relationships with one or more of these third parties  involuntary termination of one or more of those relationships  or business interruptions  slowdowns or failures affecting one or more of these third parties whether caused by adverse economic conditions which cause business failure of the vendor  or other events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
operation in a highly regulated industry and compliance failures may result in severe penalties and other harmful governmental or sro actions against us the securities and futures industries are subject to extensive regulation covering all aspects of those businesses 
regulation of forex dealer and brokerage services is increasing as well 
the various governmental authorities and industry sros that supervise and regulate our brokerage firm have broad enforcement powers to censure  fine  suspend  enjoin  expel or issue cease and desist orders to our brokerage firm or any of its officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations 
there have been  and may soon be  several specific rules enacted that affect or could affect our business 
for example  rules relating specifically to active traders have 
table of contents been enacted and more may be enacted which severely limit the operations and potential success of our business model 
recently  several states  including florida where we are headquartered  have been considering new or modified legislation that could increase the power of state regulatory authorities to sanction or suspend a brokerage firm that fails to comply with regulatory requirements or experiences adverse results in customer arbitrations 
additionally  any future action that a government agency or sro might take to tax securities transactions such as the proposed congressional bill to impose a transaction tax on the purchase and sale of securities  impose stricter borrowing limits on investors such as the proposed finra rule to limit the leverage available to retail investors in the forex market  restrict short sales such as the temporary ban in on short selling of financial sector securities or in any other way limit or add to the costs associated with trading in one or more types of securities  might negatively impact the number of trades in which our clients engage or the costs of  or how we conduct  our business and  consequently  negatively impact our net revenues and net income 
our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our brokerage s maintenance of compliance and reporting systems  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other operations personnel and enter into suitable contractual relationships with appropriate vendors  lenders and counterparties 
new or modified regulatory rules or requirements  or increased or more stringent enforcement and higher fines or greater sanctions concerning the way our brokerage operates its business including increased regulatory investigations into the accounts of our clients as a result of the current economic crisis and certain recent enforcement actions and investigations could materially increase our brokerage s cash requirements to conduct its business  require substantial increases in compliance  legal and or brokerage operations costs or result in fines  penalties or sanctions  limit or reduce our brokerage s access to  or use of  a significant proportion of its now available cash  or otherwise limit our brokerage s ability to operate its business 
decreases in short term interest rates or in our customer account balances reduce our interest income  which has historically been a significant component of our brokerage revenues  net revenues and net income we have historically derived a significant portion of our brokerage revenues from interest income on customers credit balances and account borrowings overnight margin balances 
decreases in the federal funds target and daily rates of interest in and have had  and are expected to continue to have  a negative impact on our interest income and  therefore  our brokerage revenues  net revenues and net income 
our business outlook for assumes that the federal funds target rate of interest will be approximately throughout changes in interest rates or in the size of such balances and borrowings  depending upon the extent of the change  could materially change  positively or negatively depending upon the direction of the change the amount of our interest income 
our brokerage must meet net capital  deposit and other financial and regulatory requirements as a broker dealer and futures commission merchant that  if not satisfied  could result in severe penalties or other negative consequences  and which could reduce or limit the cash we have available to run our business the sec  finra  the cftc  the nfa  the dtcc ie  nscc and dtc  the occ  certain exchanges and other regulatory and self regulatory agencies or organizations have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and futures commission merchants  large  fluctuating cash deposit requirements  and reserve  settlement and other financial requirements 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital or satisfy required deposit  settlement  reserve and other financial and regulatory obligations  it may be subject to fines  penalties  limitations on the type or size of business it is 
table of contents permitted to conduct  or suspension or revocation of registration by the sec or cftc and suspension or expulsion by finra or the nfa  which could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation 
recent record levels and severe swings in market volatility have resulted in large and frequent changes in our available cash as we comply with these various requirements 
in addition  if new or modified regulatory rules or requirements  or increased or more stringent enforcement and higher fines or greater sanctions  concerning required net capital  deposits  reserves  settlement obligations or other uses of cash  or the manner in which we operate our business and monitor and ensure compliance of our business operations with applicable laws  rules and regulations  are enacted or imposed in response to the current economic crisis and certain recent enforcement actions and investigations  such rules or requirements could materially increase our cash requirements to conduct our business  require substantial increases in compliance  legal and or brokerage operations costs or result in fines  penalties or sanctions  limit or reduce our access to  or use of  a significant percentage of our now available cash  or otherwise limit our ability to expand or even maintain our then present levels of business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
also  our ability to withdraw capital from our tradestation securities brokerage subsidiary is subject to sec rules  which  particularly if withdrawal rules become more restrictive  could materially impact our available working capital and materially impact or limit our ability to make acquisitions  repay debt as and when due  redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock  if required or desirable  and pay dividends in the future 
see we may need cash in the foreseeable future below 
if we are unable to accelerate or otherwise improve our technology development schedule with respect to release or launch dates of planned product and service initiatives and enhancements  the quality of our products and services and competitiveness in the active trader market may decline we currently have several technology development projects and initiatives in progress to launch new or enhanced features  products and services we believe will increase and improve the quality of our offering  our competitiveness in the marketplace  our ability to penetrate further the active trader market in the us and abroad and certain segments of the buy side institutional trader market  and customer retention 
we believe it is important to accelerate or otherwise improve the currently planned release dates of these products and initiatives and  toward that end  are seeking to increase our product development information technology headcount in and have adopted new approaches to product development 
despite our efforts  it is difficult to quickly hire qualified technology personnel who will be able to make significant positive contributions in the short term  and  if we fail to increase adequately or otherwise use effectively and efficiently our technology development resources to complete and launch these projects and initiatives  we may lose market share or suffer other material adverse consequences 
our systems and our customers accounts may from time to time be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt operations  harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability our online electronic trading platform includes security features that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of customer accounts 
despite these security features  our systems and our customers accounts may from time to time be vulnerable to security risks such as break ins and similar problems caused by third parties 
we have experienced occurrences of unauthorized intrusion and criminal activity in customer accounts by persons who unlawfully access customer accounts and then place orders or other transactions in those accounts 
although we have taken measures and are in the process of completing measures to limit or prevent similar occurrences in the future  no assurance can be made that any such measures will be successful or that future occurrences will not result in substantial account losses that will ultimately be borne by us 
such intrusions and other disruptions could also disrupt our operations  harm our reputation and subject us to potential liability 

table of contents we are exposed to credit risk we make margin loans to clients collateralized by client securities  and borrow securities to cover trades 
in fact  nearly all of our clients accounts are margin  as opposed to cash  brokerage accounts 
a portion of our net revenues is derived from interest on margin loans 
to the extent that these margin loans exceed client cash balances maintained with us  we must obtain financing from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or in sufficient amounts 
by permitting clients to purchase securities on margin  we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit  especially during periods of rapidly declining markets such as those experienced in the past six months in which the value of the collateral substantially decreases in proportion to the amount of a client s indebtedness 
while we have implemented additional risk management procedures designed to reduce this risk  there can be no assurance that we will not experience periodic or frequent unsecured account debits that materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  we collateralize borrowings of securities by depositing cash or securities with lenders 
sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure by parties to the borrowing transactions to honor their commitments could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers many aspects of the securities  futures and forex brokerage business  including online trading services  involve substantial risks of liability 
in recent years there has been a high incidence of litigation involving the securities and futures brokerage industry  including both class action and individual suits and arbitrations that generally seek substantial damages  including in some cases punitive damages 
recent losses in the markets and certain recent enforcement actions and investigations have increased this risk and we expect more clients will be asserting claims and arbitration rights against their brokerage firms in the foreseeable future 
the technology we use and rely upon  in addition to offering charting  trade analysis and trade execution services of various kinds  is designed to automatically locate  with immediacy  the best available price in the appropriate market in completing execution of a trade triggered by programmed market entry and exit rules 
there are risks that the electronic communications and other systems upon which these products and services rely  and will continue to rely  or our products and services themselves  as a result of flaws or other imperfections or limitations in their designs or performance  may operate too slowly  fail  cause confusion or uncertainty to the user  or operate or produce results not understood or intended by the user 
an investor or trader using either our full electronic trading platform or our subscription service might claim that investment or trading losses or lost profits resulted from use of a flawed version of one of our trading software tools or systems  or inaccurate assumptions made by the trading software tools regarding data  or inaccurate data 
major failures of this kind may affect all customers who are online simultaneously 
any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of the above described risks 
while our contracts with customers are  we believe  clear that customers who do business with us must knowingly assume all of the risks described above  there can be no assurance that a judge  arbitrator or regulator would enforce or honor such contractual provisions 
see conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity and systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers above 

table of contents the loss of key employees could decrease the quality of our management and operations our success depends to a very significant extent on the continued availability and performance of a number of senior management and product development personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our company 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
although we do not believe that we are or will be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  any infringement case that may be brought against us could result in our being unable to use intellectual property which is integral to our business 
we may not be able to adequately protect or preserve our rights in intellectual property our success is and will continue to be heavily dependent on proprietary technology  including existing trading software  internet  web site and order execution technology  and those types of technology currently in development 
we view our technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  patent protection  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we own two patents  and also have pending patent applications covering certain aspects of the tradestation electronic platform  but we do not yet know for certain if the patents will be issued 
policing unauthorized use of our products and services is difficult  however  and we may be unable to prevent  or unsuccessful in attempts to prevent  theft  copying  infringement or other unauthorized use or exploitation of our product and service technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect or defend our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies or products and services 
self clearing equity trades for active trader accounts has risks self clearing operations for our active trader equities accounts stocks and etfs began in september and for equity and index options trades began in march prior to the september conversion of clearing services  all of our customers equities trades were cleared through bear stearns which was acquired by jp morgan chase in  as our clearing agent  which also provided to our active trader clients its short sale borrowing inventory 
errors made by us related to the confirmation  receipt  settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions  the custody and control of client securities and other assets  or otherwise relating to the handling of our clients securities and funds  could lead to civil penalties and increased deposit and other requirements by governmental and self regulatory organizations  as well as losses and liability in lawsuits relating to client accounts affected by such errors 
also  our savings from self clearing may be more than offset by account losses or reduced trading activity if we experience difficulties in providing to our clients sufficient short sale borrowing inventory or if any self clearing mistakes or failures occur which undermine our customers or prospects confidence in our ability to conduct reliable self clearing operations

table of contents there are risks relating to our ability to maintain customer privacy and security and that increased government regulation of internet business may occur customers may refuse to transact business over the internet  particularly business  such as ours  that involves the handling of significant amounts of customers funds  due to privacy or security concerns 
this risk will grow if  as and to the extent cyberterrorism occurs or is perceived to be a viable  prominent threat or likelihood to occur or recur on a regular basis 
we do incorporate security measures into our privacy policies 
however  no assurances can be made that a breach of such measures will not occur  and a major breach of customer privacy or security could have serious consequences for our internet based operations  which are central to our business 
use of the internet  particularly for commercial transactions  may not continue to increase as rapidly as it has during the past few years as a result of privacy or security concerns  or for other reasons 
if this occurs  the growth of our operations would be materially hindered 
if internet activity becomes heavily regulated in these respects or otherwise  that could also have significant negative consequences for the growth of our current and planned operations 
regulation s p  an expansive sec regulation concerning privacy  has many rules and requirements and we risk incurring substantial fines  and other negative regulatory consequences  if we fail to meet those requirements 
see our systems and our customers accounts may from time to time be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt operations  harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability above 
we may need cash in the foreseeable future while we anticipate having sufficient cash to meet our needs over the next months  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the rate of customer acceptance of our products and services  including the number of new brokerage accounts acquired and the number and volume of trades made by our brokerage customers  the use of cash in acquisitions or other strategic ventures should any occur  significant  increased infrastructure and operating costs as our business grows through acquisition  joint venture or otherwise  large cash or security deposit requirements which were approximately million as of march   and which are expected to increase as our business grows  increased net capital or excess net capital requirements and unanticipated reserve and settlement requirements  and new or modified regulatory requirements 
funds  if and when needed  may be raised through debt financing and or the issuance of equity securities  there being no assurance that any such type of financing on terms satisfactory to us will be available or otherwise occur 
debt financing must be repaid regardless of whether we generate revenues  net income or cash flows from our operations and may be secured by substantially all of our assets 
any equity financing or debt financing which requires issuance of equity securities or warrants to the lender would reduce the percentage ownership of the shareholders of the company 
shareholders also may  if issuance of equities occurs  experience additional dilution in net book value per share  or the issued equities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders 
a pending inquiry by canadian regulatory authorities has limited our business in canada and could result in substantial fines or settlements tradestation securities was recently contacted by canadian regulatory authorities regarding its acceptance of canadian residents as clients  and trading securities on behalf of those canadian residents  without tradestation securities being registered in canada 
we are cooperating with canadian authorities and expect this matter to continue for several months 
this inquiry could result in substantial fines or settlements and affect tradestation securities ability to accept futures and forex brokerage accounts it already does not accept equities accounts from canadian residents  which could adversely impact our future revenues in  approximately million of our brokerage commissions and fees were derived from canadian futures accounts 
as a precautionary measure  tradestation securities has not accepted any new canadian resident futures or forex accounts since the inquiry was initiated 

table of contents if rule based trading  which is the core of our brokerage service offering and selling proposition  turns out not to be as attractive to online traders as we think it will  our growth opportunities would likely be limited the foundation of our company and its growth and success to date has  we believe  been based on one core proposition  which is self directed active and serious traders are attracted to the concept of using computer software technology to use rule based or strategy trading techniques to make their trading decisions  and that the attraction to  and acceptance of  this concept by the active trader market will grow significantly over time 
if it turns out that such attraction and acceptance does not significantly grow over time  or diminishes  the size of our target market may turn out to be relatively small and  therefore  our opportunities for growth could be very limited 
the ownership interests of the cruzes in tradestation group means that important decisions affecting the company may be concentrated in the judgment of two related individuals as of march   affiliates of william r

tradestation securities self clears most of its equities and equity options business  and uses an established futures clearing firm and an established forex dealer firm to clear its futures and forex business 
beginning in september  tradestation securities commenced equities self clearing operations for its active trader client base and  beginning march   following issuance of its membership in the occ  tradestation securities commenced full self clearing of its standardized equity options trades for its active trader client base 
self clearing has provided substantial cost savings and efficiencies 
tradestation securities currently clears most institutional account securities trades through jp morgan clearing corp 
on a fully disclosed basis  or provides order execution services on a dvp rvp basis with the orders cleared and settled by the client s prime brokerage firm 
futures trades are cleared through rj o brien associates on a fully disclosed basis and  for certain institutional futures accounts  order execution services are provided on a give up basis with the orders cleared and settled by the client s prime brokerage firm 
forex trades are cleared through gain capital group  inc on a fully disclosed basis jp morgan clearing corp  jp o brien associates and gain capital group  inc are collectively referred to as clearing agents or clearing agent firms

table of contents an active brokerage account has been defined as an account that either has a positive asset balance of at least or has had activity within the past days 
in other words  an account is deemed inactive and is not included in counting total brokerage accounts if it has less than a balance and has had no activity within the past days 
as of december   tradestation securities had  equities  futures and forex accounts the vast majority of which were equities and futures accounts  a net increase of  accounts  or  when compared to the  accounts as of december  during the year ended december   tradestation securities brokerage customer account base averaged  daily average revenue trades often called darts  an increase of when compared to  during the following table presents certain brokerage metrics and account information for the years ended december  change vs

dec  dec  dec  dec  client account information total brokerage accounts average assets per account equities average assets per account futures we compute darts as follows for equities and equity and index options  a revenue trade included to calculate darts is a commissionable trade order placed by the customer and executed  regardless of the number of shares or contracts included in the trade order 
for futures and forex  a revenue trade included to calculate darts is one round turn commissionable futures contract traded  or one round turn lot or forex deal traded  regardless of the number of individual orders made and executed ie  one futures or forex order may contain numerous contracts or deals  but each round turn contract and deal is counted as a separate revenue trade 
when viewing our darts  it should be taken into account that  for equities and equity and index options  we charge commissions based mostly on share volume and number of contracts traded and generally not by revenue trade used to calculate darts 
for futures  we charge commissions on a per contract basis so each futures revenue trade included to calculate darts represents a round turn commissionable contract traded 
it should be noted that all darts are not equal 
the revenue we derive from each revenue trade depends on the asset in question equities  equity and index options  futures  forex each has a different per unit revenue structure and cost structure  and  within each asset class  revenue per equity  contract or deal varies to the extent higher volume traders receive more favorable pricing  which they often do

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
brokerage commissions and fees and net interest income brokerage commissions and fees and net interest income are the key components of our results of operations and are comprised mainly of i brokerage commissions and fees earned from securities  futures and forex transactions and  to a lesser extent  monthly platform fees earned from brokerage customers using the tradestation online trading platform  and ii net interest earned and paid from self clearing operations primarily interest earned on brokerage customer cash balances and interest earned from brokerage customer margin debit balances  interest revenue sharing arrangements with clearing agent firms  and interest on corporate cash and cash equivalents 
brokerage commission income and related clearing costs are recorded on a trade date basis as transactions occur 
platform fees are recorded on a monthly basis as services are provided 
interest revenue and interest expense are recorded as interest is earned or incurred 
income taxes we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  effective january  fin clarifies accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also prescribes guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
previously  we had accounted for tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
as required by fin  we recognized the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
at the adoption date  we applied fin to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open 
the adoption of fin on january  did not require any cumulative effect adjustments to beginning retained earnings and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as of january   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of  which was decreased to  during the year 
if this tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements  it would not have a material impact to our effective tax rate because the difference is temporary in nature 
we do not anticipate any significant changes in uncertain tax positions over the next twelve months 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred income tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
management evaluates and determines on a periodic basis the amount of the valuation allowance required and adjusts the valuation allowance as needed 
as of december  and  we had no valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets 
on a periodic basis  we will continue to evaluate our remaining deferred income tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required

uninsured loss reserves effective june   we decided to no longer carry errors or omissions insurance that covers third party claims made by brokerage customers or software subscribers as a result of alleged human or system errors  failures  acts or omissions 
this decision was made based upon our assessment of the potential risks and benefits  including significant increases in premium rates  deductibles and coinsurance amounts  reductions in available per occurrence and aggregate coverage amounts  and the unavailability of policies that sufficiently cover the types of risks that relate to our business 
we recently reviewed this insurance with insurance agents and our view remains unchanged 
each quarter  we continue to evaluate our accruals  if any  for settlements related to claims and potential claims 
estimates of settlements for such potential claims  including related legal fees  are accrued in the consolidated financial statements  as necessary 
results of operations for the three years ended december   we operated in two principal business segments i brokerage services  and ii software products and services 
the brokerage services segment primarily represents the operations of tradestation securities and  to a lesser extent  the operations of tradesation europe limited 
the software products and services segment represents the operations of tradestation technologies 
we ceased marketing our legacy software products and subscription software services in as a result  our primary sources of consolidated revenue are currently generated from the brokerage services segment  and the brokerage services segment should continue to produce most of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
for the years ended december   and  the brokerage services segment accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total consolidated net revenues 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of net revenue from the brokerage services segment was derived from equities and standardized equity option accounts 
conversely  for the years ended december    and  approximately  and  respectively  of net 
table of contents revenue from the brokerage services segment was derived from futures and forex accounts 
approximately   and of our brokerage commissions and fees during the years ended december   and  respectively  were generated by derivatives trading financial and commodity futures  equity and index options  and spot forex  as opposed to cash equities trading stocks and etfs 
given the size of the percentage of revenue from the brokerage services segment  other than our discussion and table in note of notes to consolidated financial statements segment and related information  we will discuss our results of operations for the overall company instead of on a segmented basis

the primary reasons for this growth were increases in brokerage commissions and fees of million  or  as a result of higher market volatility in the second half of and higher trade volume related mostly to growing our brokerage account base  partially offset by a decrease in net interest income of million  or  primarily as a result of decreases in the federal funds target and daily rates of interest  and  to a lesser extent  reduced receivables from brokerage customers margin balances  partially offset by account growth 
net income was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million  or  due primarily to our year over year decrease in net interest income and our year over year increase in total expenses  partially offset by a year over year increase in brokerage commissions and fees 

table of contents income before income taxes was million of net revenues for the year ended december   as compared to million of net revenues for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
our decrease in income before income taxes was due primarily to our million decrease in net interest income  increased clearing and execution costs of million and increased employee compensation and benefits of million  partially offset by increased brokerage commissions and fees of million 
our pre tax margin income before income taxes divided by net revenues decreased from to due primarily to the decrease in net interest income which has no corresponding reduction in expense and  to a lesser extent  the increase in employee compensation and benefits which resulted from merit increases and increased employee headcount and in other fixed costs associated with the growth of the company s infrastructure 
during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  or of our income before income taxes  as compared with million  or of our income before income taxes  during the year ended december  the increase in our estimated annual effective income tax rate was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest income not subject to federal income taxes 
see income taxes below 
revenues brokerage commissions and fees brokerage commissions and fees are comprised mainly of commissions for securities  futures and forex transactions and  to a lesser extent  monthly platform and other fees earned from brokerage customers using the tradestation online trading platform or other brokerage services 
for the year ended december   brokerage commissions and fees were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this million  or  increase was due primarily to a million increase in brokerage commissions from higher trading volume related primarily to increased market volatility in historically  as market volatility increases our customer accounts trade volume increases  growing our brokerage customer account base and  to a lesser extent  a million increase in platform and other fees and a million increase in exchange fee revenue resulting from a change in classification as revenue  beginning july   of certain exchange fees previously recorded as an offset to expenses  partially offset by an  decrease in revenue for order flow of equity option trades 
the change in classification of certain exchange fees resulted from the company increasing its fees for certain exchange products in excess of the amount it is charged for such products by the vendors of those data service products 
we continuously review and assess our pricing both commissions and platform fees 
in july  we began to offer our equities account customers the choice of being charged on a per share basis or a per trade basis called a flat ticket or flat commission for their equities trades 
our brokerage commissions and fees in future periods will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to add new accounts and retain existing accounts  market volatility and other market conditions  success or failure of sales and marketing campaigns  and competitive price pressure 
we cannot predict the relationship between volatility and trading volume in the future 
interest income interest income is comprised of interest earned from self clearing operations primarily interest earned on brokerage customer cash balances and interest earned from brokerage customer margin debit balances  interest revenue sharing arrangements with clearing agent firms  and interest on corporate cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities mostly us treasury money markets and other money market accounts either issued or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies 

table of contents most of our interest income is tied directly to the federal funds target or daily rates of interest 
for the year ended december   interest income was million as compared to million for the year ended december  this million  or  decrease was due primarily to decreases in the federal funds target and daily rates of interest  and  to a lesser extent  reduced receivables from brokerage customers margin balances  partially offset by account growth 
the weighted average rate of interest for equities accounts is based upon the federal funds daily effective rate of interest and  for futures accounts  it is based directly on the federal funds target rate of interest 
the federal funds daily effective rate of interest is tied to the federal funds target rate of interest and the direction the markets believe the target rate of interest will move in the future 
recently  there have been wide variations between the target rate and the daily effective rate 
we estimate  based on the size and nature of our customer assets as of december  and assuming for these purposes that the size and nature of our customer assets do not change and that the federal funds daily rate tracks closely to the target rate of interest  that each basis point increase or decrease in the federal funds target rate of interest will impact our annual net income by approximately  the average federal funds target rate of interest was and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   the federal funds target rate of interest was approximately 
interest income for future periods may be materially affected by future increases or no actions regarding the federal funds target rate of interest and the extent  if any  by which our customer cash account balances and or margin lending balances increase or decrease  the difference between the average daily effective and the target rates of interest  and any decisions we may make to provide more or less favorable debit or credit interest rates to our customers

off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  there are various contingencies not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the operating leases and purchase commitments discussed above  these include customer activities involving the execution  settlement and financing of various customer securities and futures transactions 
these customer activities may expose the company to off balance sheet credit risk in the event the customers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations 
nearly all tradestation securities customer accounts are margin accounts 
in margin transactions  tradestation securities may be obligated for credit extended to its customers by its clearing agents that are collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts with those clearing agents 
in connection with securities activities  tradestation securities also executes customer transactions involving the sale of securities not yet purchased short sales  all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to federal  self regulatory organization and individual exchange regulations and tradestation securities and its clearing agents internal policies 
additionally  tradestation securities may be obligated for credit extended to its customers by its clearing agents for futures transactions that are collateralized by cash and futures positions in the customers accounts with those clearing agents 
in all cases  such transactions may expose tradestation securities to significant off balance sheet credit risk in the event customer collateral is not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur 
this risk is heightened during times of increased market volatility which the markets experienced during the third and fourth quarters of and continue to experience as the value of customer positions fluctuate more sharply and more frequently 
in the event customers fail to satisfy their obligations  tradestation securities may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customers obligations 
tradestation securities seeks to manage the risks associated with its customers activities by requiring customers to maintain collateral in their margin accounts in compliance with various regulatory requirements  internal requirements  and the requirements of clearing agents 
tradestation securities and its clearing agents monitor required margin levels on an intra day basis and  pursuant to such guidelines  require the customers to timely deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary 
tradestation securities provides guarantees to its clearing organization and exchanges under their standard membership agreements  which require members to guarantee the performance of other members 
under the agreements  if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing organization and exchanges  other members would be required to meet shortfalls 
tradestation securities liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral 
however  management believes that the possibility of the company being required to make payments under these arrangements is remote 
accordingly  no liability has been recorded for these potential events
