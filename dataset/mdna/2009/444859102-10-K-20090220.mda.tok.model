item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview headquartered in louisville  kentucky  humana is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies  based on our revenues of billion 
we are a full service benefits solutions company  offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit products for employer groups  government benefit programs  and individuals 
as of december   we had approximately million members enrolled in our medical benefit plans  as well as approximately million members enrolled in our specialty products 
we manage our business with two segments government and commercial 
the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs  and includes three lines of business medicare  military  and medicaid 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals 
we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of sfas  which aggregates products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing  benefits  and underwriting requirements 
these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other revenue  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks  in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 
our results are impacted by many factors  but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium  aso fee  and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs 
benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces  including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures  new prescription drugs and therapies  an aging population  lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking  the tort liability system  and government regulation 
our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance 
the benefit ratio  which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues  represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability 
the selling  general  and administrative expense ratio  or sg a expense ratio  which is computed by taking total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues  administrative services fees and other revenues  represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 
government segment our strategy and commitment to the medicare programs has led to significant growth over the last three years 
medicare advantage membership increased to  members at december   up  members  or from  members at december   primarily due to sales of preferred provider organization  or ppo  and private fee for service  pffs  products 
the acquisitions of php companies  inc d b a cariten healthcare  or cariten  osf health plans  inc  or osf  securehorizons  and metcare health plans  inc  or metcare  also added  medicare hmo and ppo members 
likewise  medicare advantage premium revenues have increased to billion for from billion for in addition  recently the mix of sales has shifted increasingly to our network based ppo offerings 
we expect medicare advantage membership to increase by  to  members in nearly of our january medicare advantage members are enrolled in network based products 
our ppo membership increased from december to january  including the voluntary move of  of our pffs members 

table of contents we offer three medicare stand alone prescription drug plans  or pdps  under the medicare part d program our standard  enhanced  and complete products 
these plans provide varying degrees of coverage 
in order to offer these plans in a given year  in june of the preceding year we must submit bids to cms for approval 
during  we experienced prescription drug claim expenses for our medicare stand alone pdps that were higher than we had originally assumed in the bid that we submitted to cms in june these higher claim levels for our medicare stand alone pdps reflected a combination of several variances between our actuarial bid assumptions versus our experience 
these variances resulted from  among other things  differences between the actuarial utilization assumptions which are our attempts to predict members future utilization of drugs in the bids for our enhanced plans versus our actual claims experience in  as well as an increase in the percentage of higher cost members in both our standard and enhanced plans 
the lower stand alone pdp operating results primarily caused the decrease in consolidated earnings during compared to we believe we have addressed these issues for  based on enhancements made to our bid development and review processes 
in january  stand alone pdp membership declined by  members to approximately  resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand alone pdp premium and benefit structures to correspond with our pharmacy claims experience 
the enactment of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of  or the act  in july could affect our medicare operations 
principally  beginning in sponsors of medicare advantage pffs plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks  except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two network based medicare advantage plans 
nearly of our medicare advantage members are already enrolled in one of our network based plans as of january  we are implementing various operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to answer the challenges presented by the act 
in addition  approximately of our pffs enrollees at january  reside in geographies where we have developed a ppo network and offer a ppo plan 
we will continue to develop our ppo network and build network based plan offerings to address the network restriction 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those initiatives 
failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
our quarterly government segment earnings and operating cash flows are particularly impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership 
the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member s cumulative out of pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member s plan period which begins january for renewals 
these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total pharmacy costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages 
as a result the government segment s benefit ratio generally improves as the year progresses 
in addition  the number of low income senior members as well as year over year changes in the mix of membership in our stand alone pdp products  standard  enhanced  and complete  affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 
commercial segment we continue to increase the diversification of our commercial segment membership 
commercial segment medical membership increased  members  or from december  to  members at december   primarily as a result of the acquisitions of cariten and osf discussed more fully below  which together added approximately  fully insured members and  aso members 
the remaining increase primarily was due to enrollment gains in strategic areas of commercial growth 
individual membership increased  smart plans and other consumer offerings membership grew  and small group membership was up at december  compared to december  in addition  our commercial segment revenues grew in through expanded and new specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of compbenefits and kmg in the fourth quarter of these acquisitions significantly increased our dental membership and added new product offerings  including vision and other voluntary employee benefits including supplemental health products such as cancer  critical illness  and accident policies 
along with our acquisition of corphealth  inc d b a lifesynch  a behavioral health care 
table of contents management company  these specialty acquisitions are anticipated to enhance our commercial segment margins and our ability to appeal to more customers seeking benefit providers who offer full service solutions 
recent turmoil in the financial markets recently  the securities and credit markets have been experiencing severe volatility and disturbance  increasing risk with respect to our financial assets 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and our investment securities totaled billion  or of total assets  with of the billion invested in cash and cash equivalents 
investment securities consist primarily of debt securities of investment grade quality with an average credit rating by s p of aa at december  and an average duration of approximately years 
including cash and cash equivalents  the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately years 
we had million of mortgage backed securities associated with alt a or subprime loans at december  and no collateralized debt obligations 
gross unrealized losses of million at december  primarily were caused by an increase in interest rates from a widening of credit spreads 
all issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments  and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities 
after taking into account these and other factors  including severity  length of time of the decline  and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity  we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and  as such  no impairment was required 
during  we recognized other than temporary impairments of million of which million resulted from investments in lehman brothers holdings inc lehman or its subsidiaries 
lehman and certain of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in the other impairments primarily relate to declines in values of securities  primarily associated with the financial services industry 
of the million  million was allocated to the government segment and million was allocated to the commercial segment 
we continuously review our investment portfolios 
given current market conditions  there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other than temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 
in addition  during we terminated all interest rate swap agreements outstanding associated with our senior notes based on recent changes in the credit market environment 
in exchange for terminating these interest rate swap agreements  we received cash of million representing the fair value of the swap assets 
this transaction also fixes the interest rate on our senior notes to a weighted average rate of 
we may re enter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors 
the availability of liquidity and credit capacity in general has been impacted by the current conditions in the financial markets 
we believe our cash balances  investment securities  operating cash flows  and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements  future expansion opportunities  and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future  as well as refinance debt as it matures 
our long term debt  consisting primarily of senior notes  of  million represented of total capitalization at december  the earliest maturity of our senior notes is in june we have available a year  billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires in july as of december   there was million in borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement  primarily related to funding the acquisition of cariten described below 
certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends  loans  or other cash transfers to humana inc  our parent company  and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities 
the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory income and 
table of contents statutory capital and surplus 
in most states  prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 
based on the statutory financial statements as of december   we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of billion in our state regulated subsidiaries  billion above the aggregate billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states 
other highlights earnings decreased to per diluted common share in from per diluted common share in primarily due to lower stand alone pdp operating results  discussed previously  and other than temporary impairments related to our investment portfolio 
cash flows from operations decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  the decrease primarily resulted from decreased earnings associated with higher stand alone pdp claims 
on march   the department of defense issued its formal request for proposal for new contracts for tricare medical benefits nationwide 
we submitted our bid in june and  after discussions with the department of defense  submitted our final proposal revisions in january we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  including the primary factors that accounted for those changes
