item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a diversified spanish language media company with a unique portfolio of television and radio assets that reach hispanic consumers across the united states  as well as the border markets of mexico 
we operate in two reportable segments television broadcasting and radio broadcasting 
our net revenue for the year ended december  was million 
of that amount  revenue generated by our television segment accounted for and revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations that are located primarily in the southwestern united states  including several key us mexican border markets 
entravision is the largest affiliate group of both the top ranked univision television network and univision s telefutura network  with television stations in of the nation s top us hispanic markets 
we also operate one of the nation s largest groups of primarily spanish language radio stations  consisting of owned and operated radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada  new mexico and texas 
we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each medium s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commissions to agencies for local  regional and national advertising 
for contracts directly with agencies  we record net revenue from these agencies 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staff and amounts paid to our national representative firms  as well as expenses for marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering  and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
the comparability of our results between and is affected by acquisitions and dispositions in those periods 
in those years  we primarily acquired new media properties in markets where we already owned existing media properties 
while new media properties contribute to the financial results of their markets  we do not attempt to measure their effect as they typically are integrated into existing operations 
highlights during  we were confronted with a significant advertising downturn  both in television and radio  primarily as a result of the global financial crisis and recession 
nevertheless  our audience shares remained strong in the nation s most densely populated hispanic markets 
we reduced our debt and implemented cost reductions in order to operate as efficiently as possible in order to maximize our cash flows 
net revenue for our television segment decreased to million in  from million in this decrease of million  or  in net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in local and national 
table of contents advertising sales  primarily as a result of the weak economy 
nevertheless  we sustained solid ratings across this segment and experienced growth in the political  health care  grocery convenience stores and services advertising categories 
in addition  we continued to enjoy revenue growth from certain of our television stations located in markets with rapidly growing hispanic populations 
net revenue for our radio segment decreased to million in  from million in the decrease of million  or  in net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in local advertising sales and advertising rates  partially offset by revenue associated with the expansion of our radio division in orlando 
nevertheless  we experienced growth in the fast food restaurant and alcoholic beverage advertising categories 
in addition  we continued to concentrate our efforts on local sales  which accounted for of total radio segment sales in we have seen solid ratings growth in our markets where we broadcast jos nunca sabes lo que va a tocar you never know what he ll play  which features a mix of spanish language adult contemporary and mexican regional hits from the s through the present  as well as our stations that began broadcasting the piolin por la ma ana  syndicated morning show  one of the highest rated spanish language radio programs in the country 
in response to declining revenue during  primarily as a result of decreased advertising during the global financial crisis and recession  we implemented significant cost saving measures in the fourth quarter of  including personnel reductions and reductions in executive bonuses  employee benefits  general corporate expenses and capital expenditures 
as a result of management s budgeting process for  taking into consideration the further rapid deterioration of the economy due to the continuing global financial crisis and ongoing recession  we will implement significant additional cost saving measures beginning in april these cost saving measures will include  among other things  reductions in certain salary expenses  promotional expenses for both of our television and radio segments  certain bonuses  general corporate expenses and capital expenditures 
we will continue to evaluate the extent and effectiveness of our cost saving measures based on changing future economic conditions and our achieving or not achieving budgeted revenues  and intend to take additional measures if and as circumstances warrant 
acquisitions and dispositions in march  we acquired radio station wnue fm  serving the orlando  florida  market for million 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs  outputs and processes from this acquisition and determined that this acquisition was considered a business 
however  we may be restricted from engaging in future acquisitions under the terms of the amended credit facility agreement 
please see liquidity and capital resources below 
in a strategic effort to focus our resources on strengthening existing clusters and expanding into new us hispanic markets  we regularly review our portfolio of media properties and  from time to time  seek to divest non core assets in markets where we do not see the opportunity to grow to scale and build out media clusters 
in accordance with this strategy  we sold our outdoor advertising operations in may to lamar advertising co 
for million and we no longer have outdoor advertising operations 
accordingly  our financial statements reflect the outdoor advertising operations as discontinued operations  we have presented the related assets and liabilities as assets held for sale and reclassified the related revenue and expenses as discontinued operations 
relationship with univision univision currently owns approximately of our common stock on a fully converted basis 
as of december   univision owned approximately of our common stock on a fully converted basis 
in connection with its merger with hispanic broadcasting corporation in september  univision entered into an agreement with the us department of justice  or doj  pursuant to which univision agreed  among other things  to ensure that its percentage ownership of our company would not exceed by march  in january  we sold the assets of radio stations kbrg fm and klok am  serving the san francisco san

univision is the holder of all of our issued and outstanding class u common stock 
the class u common stock has limited voting rights and does not include the right to elect directors

table of contents results of operations separate financial data for each of the company s operating segments is provided below 
segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses  loss gain on sale of assets and impairment charge 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on the following in thousands years ended december  change to change to net revenue television radio consolidated direct operating expenses television radio consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio consolidated segment operating profit television radio consolidated corporate expenses gain on sale of assets impairment charge operating income loss consolidated adjusted ebitda capital expenditures television radio consolidated total assets television radio outdoor assets held for sale consolidated footnotes on next page 
table of contents percentage not meaningful 
consolidated adjusted ebitda means net income loss plus loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  non cash corporate expense  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include non cash stock based compensation  non cash corporate expense  non cash impairment loss  loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
since our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum net debt ratio  senior net debt ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum net debt ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt minus cash  up to a maximum of million  to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our maximum net debt ratio may not exceed to and our senior net debt ratio  or the ratio of consolidated senior debt minus cash up to million  to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  may not exceed to on a pro forma basis for the prior full year 
the actual maximum and senior net debt ratios were as follows in each case as of december  to   to   to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
the maximum net debt ratio also affects the interest rate charged for revolving loans  thus affecting our interest expense 
on march   we entered into an amendment to our credit facility agreement 
for a discussion of the new financial covenants under our amended credit facility agreement  please see syndicated bank credit facility amendments  beginning at page below 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation awards  non cash corporate expense  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
amounts represent outdoor advertising assets classified as assets held for sale 

table of contents consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to consolidated adjusted ebitda is cash flows from operating activities

our expected annual tax rate is approximately of pre tax income or loss 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  decreased due to an increase in the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets and the impairment of goodwill

liquidity and capital resources as a result of the global financial crisis and recession  and their impact on the advertising marketplace and our customers  we have experienced declining net revenues  which have had a significant negative impact on our cash flows and consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined in our syndicated bank credit facility agreement 
for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda to cash flows from operating activities  its most directly comparable gaap financial measure  please see page at december   our total consolidated debt outstanding was million 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss plus loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  non cash corporate expense  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we have taken a number of steps to address our liquidity as result of the decline in our consolidated adjusted ebitda 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased approximately million of our own term loan debt 
if we had not reduced our debt by this amount  we would have breached our senior net debt ratio covenant in effect at december  also in the fourth quarter of  we implemented significant cost saving measures  including personnel reductions and reductions in executive bonuses  employee benefits  general corporate expenses and capital expenditures 
we currently estimate that these cost saving measures will result in expense reductions of approximately million during as a result of management s budgeting process for  taking into consideration the further rapid deterioration of the economy due to the continuing global financial crisis and ongoing recession  we amended our syndicated bank credit facility agreement on march  the amendment  which is further described in syndicated bank credit facility amendments below and note to notes to consolidated financial statements  requires us to comply with certain increased quarterly leverage ratio covenants and other financial ratios  including a maximum allowed leverage ratio covenant  calculated as the ratio of consolidated total debt outstanding to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda 
in addition  the amendment imposes certain additional restrictions on our liquidity and operations  including a principal prepayment of million in march  a significantly higher interest rate on outstanding principal  and a sweep of of quarterly excess cash flow  as defined in the amendment  to repay principal on our outstanding consolidated debt 
in order to maintain compliance with the leverage ratio covenants  we will need to achieve certain quarterly  trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda targets 
at december   our cash balance was million and our debt outstanding under our syndicated bank credit facility was million 
after the debt principal prepayment of million in march  we will have million of debt outstanding under our amended credit facility agreement 
our consolidated adjusted ebitda was million for the trailing twelve month period ended december  under the amended credit facility agreement  our trailing twelve month debt to consolidated adjusted ebitda is required to be below during each quarter in if our trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda were to decrease in excess of between approximately to from consolidated adjusted 
table of contents ebitda for the year ended december   we believe that we would breach the maximum allowed leverage ratio covenant 
since consolidated adjusted ebitda is based on a trailing twelve month period  the headroom in achieving compliance each quarter may be reduced based on the results of the preceding quarters 
because net revenues factor into the calculation of consolidated adjusted ebitda  we believe we cannot experience revenue declines in excess of between approximately to in each quarter of when compared to the same quarter in the prior year 
as the covenants are based on a trailing twelve month period  the revenue headroom may be reduced based on the results of the preceding quarters 
we believe that we will achieve these net revenue levels  however  events outside of our control could give rise to further declining revenues and there can be no assurance that we will achieve these revenue levels 
we will also need to make further reductions in our operating  selling  general and administrative  and corporate expenses 
as described above  in the fourth quarter of  we implemented cost saving measures that we estimate will result in expense reductions of approximately million during because we continue to face a challenging advertising marketplace  we will implement additional cost saving measures beginning in april which we currently expect to total approximately million in expense reductions 
these cost saving measures will include  among other things  reductions in certain salary expenses  promotional expenses for both of our television and radio segments  certain bonuses  general corporate expenses and capital expenditures 
we will continue to evaluate the extent and effectiveness of our implemented cost saving measures based on changing future economic conditions and our achievement of consolidated adjusted ebitda targets throughout  and we will implement additional cost reductions in future periods in if and as circumstances warrant 
we have considered the impact of the cost reductions to our business and believe that these measures will not have a significant adverse impact on our operations during the next twelve months 
through our ongoing efforts to improve our profitability and cash flows  we are continuing to review our business for areas of additional improvement  greater efficiency and further cost reductions 
we believe that  as a result of the foregoing measures  we will be able to achieve the trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda targets under our amended credit facility agreement  and  therefore  we believe that we will be able to maintain compliance with the maximum allowed leverage ratio covenants under our amended credit facility agreement for a period of at least the next four quarters from december  however  there is no assurance that these actions will be successful or that further adverse events outside of our control may arise that would result in our inability to comply with the maximum allowed leverage ratio covenant under our amended credit facility agreement 
in such event  we might decide to use remaining cash resources to prepay our debt  which may result in limitations on available working capital 
alternatively  to meet our cash requirements and avoid failing to comply with the maximum allowed leverage ratio covenant  we may be required to obtain a further waiver or amendment to our credit facility agreement  refinance our existing debt  divest non core assets or operations and or obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there is no assurance that any such transactions could be consummated on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
in the event that we believed we were going to fail to comply with the maximum allowed leverage ratio covenant or any other financial ratios under our amended credit facility agreement  among other actions we might take  we would likely seek to obtain a waiver or further amendment from our lenders 
if we were unable to obtain such a waiver or amendment  or be in a position to take one of the other actions described in the previous paragraph  we could violate a financial covenant or ratio  which in turn could result in an event of default under our amended credit facility agreement 
if an event of default were to occur and continue  lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments outstanding under the syndicated bank credit facility could elect to accelerate the maturity of those loans outstanding under the syndicated bank credit facility 
among the consequences of such actions  we might be precluded from accessing any available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and we might be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the syndicated bank credit facility 

table of contents while we have had a history of operating losses in some periods and operating income in other periods  we also have a history of generating significant positive cash flows from our operations

syndicated bank credit facility certain terms of our syndicated bank credit facility have been amended recently 
please read this description of our syndicated bank credit facility in conjunction with the discussion under syndicated bank credit facility amendments below

in addition  we pay a quarterly unused commitment fee ranging from to per annum  depending on the level of facility used 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains customary events of default 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the syndicated bank credit facility 
lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the syndicated bank credit facility may elect to accelerate the maturity of loans upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains a mandatory prepayment clause  triggered in the event that i the proceeds of certain asset dispositions are not utilized as provided under the syndicated bank credit facility within months of such disposition  ii insurance or condemnation proceeds are not utilized as provided under the syndicated bank credit facility within days following receipt thereof  or iii the proceeds from capital contributions or equity offerings are not utilized to acquire businesses or properties relating to radio and television advertising within days following such capital contribution or equity offering 
in addition  if we incur certain additional indebtedness  then of such proceeds must be used to reduce our outstanding loan balance  and if we have excess cash flow  as defined in our syndicated bank credit facility  then of such excess cash flow must be used to reduce our outstanding loan balance 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum net debt ratio  senior debt ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants become increasingly restrictive in the later years of the syndicated bank credit facility 
our syndicated bank credit facility also requires us to maintain our fcc licenses for our broadcast properties and contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  the payment of dividends  the making of acquisitions and the sale of assets over a certain limit 
additionally  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements because our leverage exceeded certain limits 
see also the section entitled derivative instruments below 
we can draw on our revolving facility without prior approval for working capital needs and for acquisitions having an aggregate maximum consideration of million or less 
proposed acquisitions are conditioned upon our delivery to the agent bank of a covenant compliance certificate showing pro forma calculations assuming such acquisition had been consummated and revised revenue projections for the acquired properties 
for acquisitions having an aggregate maximum consideration in excess of million  consent is required from lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the syndicated bank credit facility 
syndicated bank credit facility amendments on november   we entered into an amendment to our credit facility agreement 
the amendment provides that we may repurchase and cancel outstanding loans under the credit facility agreement  at a price to be agreed upon between the company and any lender holding such loans  up to a maximum amount of million in aggregate face amount of the outstanding loans to be repurchased  and subject to such other terms and conditions described in the amendment 
the amendment also makes certain technical and conforming changes to the terms of our credit facility agreement 
all other provisions of our credit facility agreement remain in full force and effect unless expressly amended or modified by the amendment 

table of contents on march   we entered into a further amendment to our credit facility agreement 
pursuant to this amendment  among other things the interest that we pay under the credit facility will increase 
both the revolver and term loan borrowings under the amendment bear interest at a variable interest rate based on either libor or a base rate  in either case plus an applicable margin that varies depending upon our leverage ratio 
borrowings under both our revolver and term loan bear interest at libor plus a margin of when the leverage ratio is greater than or equal to when the leverage ratio is less than but greater than or equal to  borrowings under both our revolver and term loan will bear interest at libor plus a margin of 
when the leverage ratio is less than  borrowings under both our revolver and term loan will bear interest at libor plus a margin of 
borrowings under the revolver are restricted to million in the aggregate during any rolling day period when the leverage ratio is less than of the maximum allowable ratio during the applicable period 
the total amount of our revolver facility was reduced from million to million 
new conditions have been added for loans under the revolver facility greater than million 
there are more stringent financial covenants relating to maximum allowed leverage ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
beginning march   through december   the maximum allowed leverage ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  is 
the maximum allowed leverage ratio decreases to in the first quarter of on september  the maximum allowed leverage ratio decreases to and on december  the maximum allowed leverage ratio decreases to beginning march   and through the term of the agreement  the maximum allowed leverage ratio is 
from march   through the term of the agreement  the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio is 
there is a mandatory prepayment clause for of the proceeds of certain asset dispositions  regardless of our leverage ratio

beginning march   the senior net debt ratio will be eliminated 
capital expenditures are restricted to million in both and we are restricted from making acquisitions and investments when the leverage ratio is greater than  with an exception to permit the completion of the pending acquisition of television stations serving the reno  nevada market for a purchase price of up to million 
we are restricted from making future repurchases of shares of our common stock other than under a limited circumstance 
we are restricted from making any further debt repurchases in the secondary market 
the amendment also contains additional covenants  representations and provisions that are usual and customary for credit facilities of this type 
all other provisions of our credit facility agreement  as amended  remain in full force and effect unless expressly amended or modified by the amendment 
at the time of entering into this amendment  we were required to make a prepayment of million to reduce the outstanding amount of our term loans and paid our lenders an amendment fee 

table of contents derivative instruments as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october   and one interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount  with quarterly increases  that also expires on october  the three interest rate swap agreements convert a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
the one interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
it is expected that the term loan amount will not exceed the notional amount of the four interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and related interpretations and as a result  changes in their fair values are reflected currently in earnings 
we recognized an increase of million in interest expense related to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december  we recognized an increase of million in interest expense related to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december  as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million and is classified in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million and is classified in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
debt and equity financing on november   our board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program 
we completed this repurchase program in the second quarter of on april   our board of directors approved an additional million stock repurchase program 
we are authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding class a common stock from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices  block trades and private repurchases 
the extent and timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors 
we intend to finance future stock repurchases  if and when made  with available cash on hand and cash provided by operations 
under this new plan  we purchased million shares of class a common stock for approximately million during the year ended december  however  under the terms of the amended credit facility agreement  we are prevented from making future repurchases of our class a common stock 
on october   our board of directors approved the retirement of million shares of our class a common stock that were repurchased by us 
on december   our board of directors approved the retirement of an additional million shares of our class a common stock that were repurchased by us 
consolidated adjusted ebitda consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined below decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net revenue  consolidated adjusted ebitda decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we currently anticipate that consolidated adjusted ebitda will decrease during the first quarter of and possibly the entire year due to a continuing challenging advertising environment  primarily the result of the ongoing global financial crisis and continuing recession 
we do not know when the advertising environment will change 
however  we anticipate that the advertising environment will not improve until at least the economy improves and  in the case of our radio segment  is further subject to the overall general slowing of growth in the radio industry over the last several quarters 

table of contents consolidated adjusted ebitda means operating income loss plus loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  non cash corporate expense  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include non cash stock based compensation  non cash corporate expense  non cash impairment loss  loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
since our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum net debt ratio  senior net debt ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum net debt ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt minus cash  up to a maximum of million  to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our maximum net debt ratio may not exceed to and our senior net debt ratio  or the ratio of consolidated senior debt minus cash up to million  to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  may not exceed to on a pro forma basis for the prior full year 
the actual maximum and senior net debt ratios were as follows in each case as of december  to   to   to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
we entered into our current syndicated bank credit facility in september  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
however  for consistency of presentation  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definition had been applicable for all periods presented 
the maximum net debt ratio also affects the interest rate charged for revolving loans  thus affecting our interest expense 
on march   we entered into an amendment to our credit facility agreement 
for a discussion of the new financial covenants under our amended credit facility agreement  please see syndicated bank credit facility amendments  beginning at page while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation awards  non cash corporate expense  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda to cash flows from operating activities  its most directly comparable gaap financial measure  please see page cash flow net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  although we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   we had positive cash flow from operations 
our net loss was primarily a result of non cash expenses  primarily impairment charges of million 
the decrease in net cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in the net loss from continuing operations 
although we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   we had positive cash flow from operations 
our net loss was primarily a result of non cash expenses  including a carrying value adjustment charge in discontinued operations of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
we expect to continue to have positive cash flow from operating activities for the year 
table of contents for the year ended december   net cash flow provided by investing activities was million  whereas for the year ended december   net cash flow used in investing activities was million 
during the year ended december   we received million from the sale of our outdoor advertising business and spent million on net capital expenditures and million related to the acquisition of the assets of radio station wnue fm in orlando 
during the year ended december   we spent million on net capital expenditures and the acquisition of a full power television construction permit in colorado springs  colorado 
additionally  we spent million on net capital expenditures in our outdoor advertising operations  which is reported in discontinued operations 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in net cash flow used in financing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock under our stock repurchase programs for million including transaction fees  repurchased million shares of our class u common stock from univision for million  made net debt payments of million and received net proceeds of million from the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan the plan 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock under our stock repurchase program for million including transaction fees and made net debt payments of million 
we received net proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and from the sale of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
we stopped repurchasing shares of our class a common stock in january and  under the terms of the amended credit facility agreement  we are prevented from making future repurchases of our class a common stock except under a limited circumstance 
in order to reduce expenses and comply with the terms of our amended credit facility agreement  we intend to reduce capital expenditures except for critical items 
during  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million 
we anticipate paying for these capital expenditures out of net cash flow from operations 
as part of the transition from analog to digital television service  full service television station owners are required to discontinue broadcasting analog signals and to relinquish one of their paired analog digital channels to the fcc on june  we currently expect the cost to complete construction of digital television facilities for our remaining full service television stations  for which we have sought waivers from the fcc  will be approximately million 
in addition  we have elected to continue to broadcast separate digital and analog signals throughout this transition period 
we intend to finance the conversion to digital television by using net cash flow from operations 
also  in order to broadcast high definition programming in the future  we intend to begin construction at our studio control facilities in  and at our production control facilities in and we currently expect that the total cost of this high definition upgrade at our local studio and control facilities will be approximately million 
we intend to finance the high definition upgrade by using net cash flow from operations 
the amount of our anticipated capital expenditures may change based on future changes in business plans  our financial condition and general economic conditions 
commitments and contractual obligations we have agreements with certain media research and ratings providers  expiring at various dates through december  to provide television and radio audience measurement services 
we lease facilities and broadcast equipment under various operating lease agreements with various terms and conditions  expiring at various dates through november 
table of contents our material contractual obligations at december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total amounts committed less than year years years more than years syndicated bank credit facility and other borrowings and related interest media research and ratings providers operating leases and other material non cancelable contractual obligations total contractual obligations these amounts represent estimated future cash interest payments related to our syndicated bank credit facility and other borrowings 
future interest payments could differ materially from amounts indicated in the table due to future operational and financing needs  market factors and other currently unanticipated events 
please refer to syndicated bank credit facility amendments above for interest terms 
does not include month to month leases and amounts related to discontinued operations 
we have also entered into employment agreements with certain of our key employees  including walter f 
ulloa  philip c 
wilkinson  jeffery a 
liberman and christopher t 
young 
our obligations under these agreements are not reflected in the table above 
other than lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business  employment contracts for key employees and the interest rate swap agreements described more fully in item a below  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries or any interests in or relationships with any variable interest entities that are not included in our consolidated financial statements

our stockholders approved the employee stock purchase plan on may  at our annual meeting of stockholders 
subject to adjustments in our capital structure  as defined in the employee stock purchase plan  the maximum number of shares of our class a common stock that will be made available for sale under the employee stock purchase plan is million  plus an annual increase of up to million shares on the first day of each of the ten calendar years beginning on january  all of our employees are eligible to participate in the employee stock purchase plan  provided that they have completed six months of continuous service as employees as of an offering date 
there are two offering periods annually under the employee stock purchase plan  one which commences on february and concludes on august  and the other which commences on august and concludes on the following february since the inception of the employee stock purchase plan through december   approximately million shares have been purchased 
application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following are our critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets each of our operating segments is a reporting unit 
we assign all of our assets and liabilities to our reporting units and do not amortize goodwill and our indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that our broadcast licenses are indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our results of operations  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses represents all licenses owned and operated within an individual market cluster as such licenses are used together  are complimentary to each other and are representative of the best use of those assets 
our individual market clusters are cities or nearby cities 
we test our broadcasting licenses for impairment based on assumptions about these market clusters 
assumptions about future revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state of the economy and the fluctuation of actual revenue and the timing of expenses 
we develop future revenue estimates based on projected ratings increases  planned timing of signal strength upgrades  planned timing of promotional events  customer commitments and available advertising time 
estimates of future cash flows assume that expenses will grow at rates consistent with historical rates 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions about cash flows after conversion reflect estimates of how these stations are expected to perform based on similar stations and markets and possible proceeds from the sale of the assets 
if the expected cash flows are not realized  impairment losses may be recorded in the future 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets is performed by a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
in addition  we evaluate annually and when triggering events occur  the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is determined to have a finite useful life  the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible assets subject to amortization 

table of contents long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances  such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
revenue contracts with advertising agencies are recorded at an amount that is net of the commission retained by the agency 
revenue from contacts directly with the advertisers is recorded at gross revenue and the related commission or national representation fee is recorded in operating expense 
cash payments received prior to services rendered result in deferred revenue  which is then recognized as revenue when the advertising time or space is actually provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable consist of a homogeneous pool of relatively small dollar amounts from a large number of customers 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
derivative instruments sfas requires us to recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 

table of contents the carrying amount of our interest rate swap agreements is recorded at fair market value  including non performance risk  and any changes to the value are recorded as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
the fair market value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined by using multiple broker quotes  adjusted for non performance risk  which estimate the future discounted cash flows of any future payments that may be made under such agreements 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october   and one interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount  with quarterly increases  that also expires on october  as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  the increase in fair value is classified as a reduction of interest expense on our statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized an increase of million in interest expense related to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
discontinued operations we sold the outdoor advertising business in may of and no longer have outdoor operations 
in accordance with sfas  we have reported the results of the outdoor advertising business for all periods presented in discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of operations 
in the statements of cash flows  the cash flows of discontinued operations have been reclassified for all periods presented and are separately classified within the respective categories with those of continuing operations 
the outdoor advertising business has been presented as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  certain amounts in our prior period consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
all discussions and amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated statements for all periods presented relate to continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted

fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fsp on our financial statements 
sensitivity of critical accounting estimates we have critical accounting estimates that are sensitive to change 
the most significant of those sensitive estimates relate to the impairment of intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually on october for impairment  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
in  we conducted an impairment analysis in the third quarter and fourth quarter 
television in each of the third and fourth quarters of  we conducted a review of our television reporting unit and determined that the fair value of our television reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
the fair value of the television reporting unit was primarily determined by evaluating discounted cash flow models and a market based approach 
the assumptions in the models were based on the reporting unit s projected ability to generate cash flows in various cities or nearby cities  which we refer to as market clusters  based on signal coverage of the markets 
the fair value of the reporting unit and the fcc licenses contains significant assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance using industry normalized information for an average station within a market 
these variables would include the forecasted growth rate of each television market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate based on the risk inherent in the future cash flows and the likely media competition within the market area 
the market based approach used comparable company earnings multiples 
in the third quarter of  we determined that the carrying values of certain television fcc licenses exceeded their fair values and we recognized impairment charges of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we had an additional impairment charge of million of our television fcc licenses and million of our television syndicated programming contracts 
for the year ended december   we had a total of million in impairment charges for our television reporting unit 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our television reporting unit and fcc licenses  we used discounted cash flow models that rely on various assumptions  such as future cash flows  discount rates and multiples 
our estimates of future cash flows assume that our television segment revenues will increase significantly faster than the increase in our television expenses  and therefore our television assets will also increase in value 
if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an additional expense for impairment

in the third quarter of  we determined that our radio reporting unit carrying value exceeded its fair values and we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
at that time  we also determined that the carrying values of certain radio fcc licenses exceeded their fair values and we recognized impairment charges of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we had an additional impairment charge of million of goodwill in our radio segment and million of our radio fcc licenses

impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into three interest rate swap agreements  and an additional interest rate swap agreement in february  described more fully in item a below 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries or any interests in  or relationships with  any material variable interest entities that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
except for the items discussed above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities other than lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business and employment contracts for key employees 
the carrying amount of our interest rate swap agreements are recorded at fair market value and any changes to the value are recorded as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
the fair market value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined by using multiple broker quotes  which estimate the future discounted cash flows of any future payments that may be made under such agreement 
we converted a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation at september  in february  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement  as a result of which we do not expect that our term loan amounts will exceed the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements 
if the future interest yield curve decreases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the potential loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in the financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the base rates on our variable rate debt 
however  since february  we have had four swap arrangements that convert the entire amount of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  if we exceed certain leverage ratios we would be required to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps or interest rate caps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to risk from changes in interest rates 
our current policy prohibits entering into derivatives or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rates our term loan bears interest at libor plus a margin of  for a total interest rate of at december  as of december   million of our term loan was outstanding 
our revolving facility bears interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our leverage 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and million was available under the revolving facility for future borrowings 
our syndicated bank credit facility requires us to enter into interest rate agreements if our leverage exceeds certain limits as defined in our credit agreement 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october   and one interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount  with quarterly increases  that also expires on october  the three interest rate swap agreements convert a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
the one interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
it is expected that the term loan amounts will not exceed the notional amount of the four interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  changes in their fair values are reflected currently in earnings 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million and is classified as other liabilities on the balance sheet 
we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
as of december   our interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  the fair value is classified as other liabilities on our balance sheet and as an increase of interest expense on our statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized an increase of million of interest expense related to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
we converted a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation at september  in february  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement  as a result of which we do not expect that our term loan amounts will exceed the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements 
if the future interest yield curve decreases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease
