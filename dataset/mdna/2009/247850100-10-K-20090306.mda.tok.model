item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction deltic timber corporation deltic or the company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber 
deltic owns approximately  acres of timberland  primarily in arkansas and north louisiana 
the company s sawmill operations are located at ola in central arkansas the ola mill and at waldo in south arkansas the waldo mill 
in addition to its timber and lumber operations  the company is engaged in real estate development in central arkansas 
the company also holds a percent interest in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a joint venture to manufacture and market medium density fiberboard mdf 
deltic is a calendar year company for both financial and income tax reporting 
the company is organized into four segments woodlands  which manages all aspects of the timberlands including harvesting and sale of timber  timberland sales and acquisitions  oil and gas mineral revenues  and hunting land leases  mills  which consists of deltic s two sawmills that manufacture a variety of softwood lumber products  real estate  which includes the company s real estate developments and a related country club operation  and corporate  which consists of executive management  accounting  information systems  human resources  purchasing  treasury  income tax  and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units 
the company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units 
the company s timberlands consist primarily of southern pine  known in the industry as a type of softwood 
deltic considers its timberlands to be the company s most valuable asset and the harvest of stumpage to be its most significant and consistent source of income  accordingly  deltic actively manages its timberlands to increase productivity and maximize the long term value of these timber assets 
the company harvests timber from the timberlands in accordance with its harvest plans and sells such timber in the domestic market or converts it to lumber in its sawmills 
stumpage supplied to the company s sawmills is transferred at prices that approximate market in its operating regions 
deltic derives additional revenues from its timberlands in the form of hunting leases  mineral lease bonuses  mineral royalties  and land easements 
in late  the company implemented a timberland acquisition program to enable it  when desired  to increase harvest levels  while expanding its timber inventory 
the company continues to focus its acquisition program on timberland within its current operating area 
additionally  as market conditions allow  deltic will sell tracts of land where market values exceed that of the tracts worth as a timber growing platform 
during  and especially in the fourth quarter  deltic was able to significantly increase its sales of non strategic recreational use hardwood bottomland 
the company looks to continue these sales in coming years as it seeks to replace the non strategic acres with strategic southern yellow pine sawtimber producing acres 
the company s two sawmills employ modern technology in order to improve efficiency  reduce labor costs  maximize utilization of the timber resource  and maintain high standards for production quality  with safety being one of its highest priorities 
in addition  each mill is strategically located near significant portions of the company s timberlands 
the mills produce a variety of lumber products  including dimension lumber  timbers  and boards 
these lumber products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors  lumber treaters  and truss manufacturers in the southern and mid western united states and are used mainly in residential construction  roof trusses  and laminated beams 
the company s real estate operations were started in to maximize the value of former timberland strategically located in the growth corridor of west little rock  arkansas 
since that time  the company has been developing chenal valley  a premier planned community consisting of  acres of residential and commercial properties 
the property is being developed in stages  and real estate sales to date have consisted primarily of residential lots  which are sold to builders or individuals  and commercial sites 
in addition to chenal valley  deltic has developed chenal downs  a acre development located just outside chenal valley  and is developing red oak ridge  an acre development in hot springs  arkansas 

table of contents the del tin fiber plant is located near el dorado  arkansas 
construction of the plant was completed  and initial production began in the plant is designed to have a rated annual production capacity of million square feet mmsf of inch mdf  making it one of the largest plants of its type in north america 
mdf  which is used primarily in the furniture  store fixture  laminate flooring  and molding industries  is manufactured from sawmill residuals such as chips  shavings  and sawdust  pressed and held together by an adhesive bond 
executive overview deltic is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity based business environment  with a major diversification in real estate development 
this environment is affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates  availability and costs of credit  imports  foreign exchange rates  housing starts  new and existing home inventories  home foreclosures  residential repair and remodeling  commercial construction  industry capacity and production levels  the availability of raw materials  cost of fuel  and weather conditions 
given its relative size and the nature of most commodity markets  the company has little or no influence over the market s pricing levels for its wood products 
accordingly  the company will continually seek to reduce controllable costs and expenses from its manufacturing processes 
sales of real estate are affected by general economic conditions  interest rates  home foreclosures  new and existing home inventories  and the availability and cost of credit  specifically as such factors are manifested in the company s operating area of central arkansas 
significant accomplishments for the company s operating segments during the year of include the woodlands segment capitalized on the strong demand for pulpwood and achieved a percent higher average sales price per ton for pine pulpwood and a percent higher average sales price per ton for hardwood pulpwood  the sale of approximately  acres of non strategic  recreational use  hardwood bottomland and the utilization of the proceeds to enhance deltic s core timberland holdings  the mills segment achieved positive cash flow in the current year due to continued improvements in operating efficiencies and the benefits from reduced unit manufacturing cost  primarily through lower log supply cost  and the real estate segment s red oak ridge development reported its second best level of annual residential sales activity 
the woodlands segment maintained its position as the company s established core operation 
the pine sawtimber harvest volume increased slightly to  tons when compared to s volume of  tons  but the average sales price decreased percent to per ton 
despite the decline in the average pine sawtimber sales price  the segment s overall operating income increased by million  or percent 
the improvement was due to increased sales of non strategic hardwood bottomland  higher revenues from hunting and oil and gas lease rentals and royalties  and easements and rights of way  and increased other revenues resulting from the natural gas drilling activity occurring on the company s fee lands  including damages for acreage taken out of timber production for wellsite locations  and fees for allowing seismic testing 
since deltic expects the markets for residential housing and lumber to remain depressed through  prices received for pine sawtimber harvested for this period are not expected to improve from current levels 
while lumber production levels within a region can influence pine sawtimber prices  lumber prices typically do not 
over the long term  there is a fundamental correlation between the level of lumber prices and pine sawtimber prices 
however  in the short term  the geographical size differential between the lumber and pine sawtimber markets results in the two acting somewhat independently of each other 
pine sawtimber markets operate primarily within local or regional areas with sales being mainly to sawmills 
these mills are subject to a relatively fixed level of demand for raw materials that is driven by the facilities required production levels 
changes in pricing levels within the lumber market typically do not have an immediate effect on the existing demand for raw materials in the short term  therefore  the resulting impact on pine sawtimber prices will usually lag in timing and be less volatile than the market for lumber 
this trend would typically also be true in the short term during times of a depressed lumber market 
ultimately  the company s ability to sell pine sawtimber at acceptable prices in the future will be dependent upon the size or existence of markets for manufactured lumber and other wood products 
the company continues to manage the harvest level of its forests on a sustainable yield basis 

table of contents timberland designated as higher and better use consists of tracts with market values that exceed the land s worth as a timber growing platform 
deltic s approximately  acre timberland holdings in the expanding westward growth corridor of little rock  arkansas  is an example of such land 
non strategic timberland is composed primarily of hardwood bottomland acreage not suitable for the growing of pine timber for which the demand by recreational users for hunting  etc 
has increased in recent years  tracts too small to allow efficient timber management  those geographically isolated from other company fee lands  or any other acreage not deemed strategic to deltic s operations or growth 
approximately  acres of non strategic hardwood bottomland was sold during additional sales of these acres will continue in and beyond as market conditions allow 
the sales of the non strategic hardwood bottomland were accomplished in conjunction with acquiring  acres of pine timberland 
by utilizing the tax deferring  like kind exchange method  deltic was able to minimize the tax consequences and invested or will invest timberland sale proceeds into pine timberland 
in addition to pine and hardwood timber sales  the company receives additional values of land ownership  such as revenues from hunting leases  mineral lease rentals and royalties  and land easements  that have historically provided additional income to deltic s woodlands segment 
recent advances in technology and increased pricing levels have resulted in the economic viability of expanded natural gas exploration within the state of arkansas 
one current area of activity  known as the fayetteville shale play  is an unconventional natural gas reservoir  ranging in depth from  feet to  feet  and is spread across multiple arkansas counties 
deltic has leased approximately  acres in this area to various exploration enterprises and received applicable lease rental payments  with the possibility of future royalty income should production be established 
the company continues to evaluate additional leasing requests within the currently defined boundary of the fayetteville shale play  although future leasing will probably not be significant within this boundary 
production has begun in a few areas and deltic received over million in royalty payments from this area in the ultimate benefit to deltic from these mineral leases remains speculative and unknown to the company and is contingent on the level of natural gas prices and the successful extraction and sale of natural gas from the area 
for the mills segment  the status of the lumber market and the resulting pricing for the company s commodity softwood lumber products will continue to impact operating strategies and financial results 
by the end of  the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts had reached its lowest level in years 
factors affecting this decline were the us economic recession  falling home prices  stricter mortgage lending practices brought about by sub prime loan failures  construction loan delinquencies that are causing lenders to tighten credit for new developments  increased home foreclosure rates  and increased new and existing home inventory levels 
the segment s average lumber sales price declined six percent when compared to lumber sales volume increased percent compared to due mainly to the three month suspension of production at the waldo mill while undergoing fire related repairs in combined with improved hourly production rates throughout as with any commodity market  the company expects the historical volatility of lumber prices to continue in the future 
other factors impacting future lumber prices include the level of production capacity utilized  inventory levels  and the level of repair and remodeling activity 
many industry analysts are projecting that the market for new housing will not improve during that  along with excess production capacity and high inventory levels  could have a negative impact on lumber sales prices 
as in the past  deltic will make timely management decisions to take advantage of supply and demand situations 
since commodity based markets rarely benefit from real price growth  after inflation  deltic has concentrated management s attention  in regard to its manufacturing operations  on improving sales realizations through product and customer mix enhancements and improving production efficiencies and the cost structure at its lumber mills 
the company has achieved improved production efficiencies at both of its sawmills  largely as a result of an intensive capital upgrade program over the past four years 
this improvement has been more significant at the ola mill  as the upgrade program there has focused on maximizing hourly productivity rates with the smaller log size available as raw material for the mill 
in  deltic installed a new log bucking system at this sawmill  improving the log to lumber yield ratio there 
deltic will continue to seek opportunities that will enable it to increase operating efficiencies  while reducing controllable cost 

table of contents sales activity levels for the company s real estate developments have been affected by economic conditions that influence the level of housing starts in the central arkansas region  including general economic conditions  new and existing housing inventories  home foreclosure rates  and stricter lending requirements for homebuyers and builders 
these conditions contributed to a decrease in the overall demand for residential lots in chenal valley  the largest of the company s three active developments  as evidenced by chenal valley s residential lot closings 
this was a reduction of lots from s level of residential lot closings 
as of december   there were developed lots in chenal valley uncommitted 
the company opened new lots during to maintain a specific mix of lot offerings 
ultimately  the impact to deltic s overall real estate business model from fluctuations  both positive and negative  in the annual volumes of residential lot sales is deemed minimal in light of the company s continued focus on the long term financial returns from the ultimate build out of the chenal valley development 
in deltic s other two active developments  red oak ridge had sales of lots and chenal downs had two lot sales 
deltic has developed lots in red oak ridge and in chenal downs uncommitted as of year end while chenal downs is fully developed  deltic plans to develop additional lots within red oak ridge as demanded by market conditions 
actual future annual lot development levels will be dependent upon the demand for the company s residential lots 
the real estate segment s average sales price for residential lots sold in was  which was a decrease of percent when compared to  due to the current year sales mix 
the company has not nor does it plan to reduce the sales price of its residential lots 
deltic s lot development plans provide for a mix of lot offerings that represent all real estate market segments for a planned community 
neighborhoods adjoining chenal country club s second hole  championship golf course designed by robert trent jones  jr 
represent the highest priced market segment in the chenal valley development 
average prices for non golf course lots are lower and vary between neighborhoods depending on other factors such as lot size and location 
the mix of lot offerings for any given year will be driven by lot inventory and expected demand 
commercial real estate sales activity is by nature less predictable than residential activity 
with the number of residents and past growth in west little rock  specifically chenal valley  the company continues to receive interest in multi family housing sites and commercial real estate in and around the vicinity of the promenade at chenal  an upscale shopping center within chenal valley that opened in  though economic uncertainties and stricter lending requirements has had an impact on commercial acreage closings 
there were no sales of commercial real estate acreage in compared to acres in future pricing trends for commercial real estate sales are difficult to predict and are influenced by multiple factors  which include intended use of the site  and property location and access 
no commercial acreage is included in the chenal downs development 
red oak ridge includes a small amount of commercial property  depending on actual final land usages 
the company will begin to develop and offer commercial sites as this development s population density increases 
there were no sales of undeveloped acreage during  while the company sold approximately acres in operating results for del tin fiber are affected primarily by the overall mdf market and plant operating performance 
del tin was able to operate at a profitable level during by passing through the higher raw material costs  in the form of price increases  and improved production efficiencies 
the demand for thin board  used in store fixtures and laminate flooring  remained strong through the first nine months of  but with the reduction in housing starts along with the current recession  the market began weakening in the fourth quarter 
del tin has continued to maximize earnings potential of the thin board production by developing a strategy to grow market share for this product 
operationally  del tin fiber maintained its uptime percentage and premium grade production levels 
the facility was able to push through increased raw material costs to its customers  however  del tin will continue to be affected by decreased supply and increased costs for wood fiber used in the manufacturing process 
the wood fiber supply and cost issues are due largely to a shortage of softwood residual wood chips as area lumber mills curtailed production in reaction to lumber market conditions 
with reduced mill production levels  the volume of residual by product chips produced decreases proportionally 
during and  the resin glue utilized to bond mdf in the manufacturing process increased significantly in price due to substantial price increases in methanol  which is a raw material used in the manufacture of the resin glue 
due to decreases in the cost of methanol in late and curtailments by wood product manufacturing facilities that use the resin glue  there is currently an increased supply of resin glue 
with this reduction in cost to manufacture resin glue and increased supply  del tin s cost for resin is starting to decrease 

table of contents for  wood fiber cost is expected to remain near current levels  while resin glue prices are projected to decrease 
manufacturers have been able to recover a portion of their raw materials cost through price increases  though it may slip some with the decreased cost for resin glue 
del tin fiber s efforts will be concentrated on further improvements in its hourly productivity level and other plant operating efficiencies  while making additional reductions in the plant s manufacturing cost structure where possible 
on may   the food  conservation  and energy act of was enacted 
within this act was the tree act  which included a provision for a reduced federal tax rate on qualified timber gains for one year 
gains on qualified timber sales beginning may   through may   will be taxed at a percent alternate tax rate for corporations 
efforts are ongoing to extend this provision for another year or to make this legislation permanent  but law changes are not certain until passed by both houses of congress and signed into law by the president 
due to the lack of taxable income for deltic in  the effects of this act were inconsequential for the year  but could provide a lower effective tax rate in deltic has benefited from various discrete tax items in that combined to provide a lower effective tax rate 
significant events on october   deltic delivered a notice of voluntary prepayment to all participants in the million note purchase agreement dated december   as amended 
in the agreement  the company requested that the note purchasers waive any prepayment penalty or other requirement to pay any make whole fees 
all participants except modern woodmen of america accepted the terms on october  as a result  million of the million notes were paid in full on november   and cancelled 
on june   the company entered into an agreement with metropolitan life and a group of other domestic insurance companies to amend the existing note agreement of the  private placement senior notes 
the amendment changed the minimum fixed charge coverage and other ratios applicable to the company s business to be the same as those contained in the company s series a senior notes placed with the american agcredit pca 
on august   deltic amended its revolving credit agreement with suntrust bank and other banks whereby the unsecured and committed revolving credit facility was increased from million to million 
an option to request an increase in the amount of aggregate revolving commitments from million to million was reinstated 
the agreement  which was set to expire on september   was extended to september  the funds available through this agreement will enable the company to take full advantage of value added growth opportunities as they present themselves 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with american agcredit pca to amend and restate the terms of the company s series a senior notes notes in the principal amount of million 
under the new agreement  the notes are due and payable december  prior to the agreement  the notes would have become due on december   pursuant to a note purchase agreement effective december  the interest rate for the notes remains the same as under the agreement percent through december   and after that date  the rate was reduced to percent for the balance of the term of the notes 
on april   red development llc announced that it planned to purchase from deltic a site within chenal valley for the promenade at chenal  an upscale lifestyle shopping center 
after extensive efforts by both parties  the sale of acres of commercial property was closed on september  construction began on the shopping center in and was completed in may the development of the promenade at chenal is strategic to chenal valley in that it is expected to further increase interest in the company s additional acres of commercially zoned property adjacent to the site 

table of contents from the time production began at del tin fiber in until the fourth quarter of  both operating and financial performance was below the expectations established at the time that the decision to construct the plant was made 
as a result  on april   deltic announced that banc one capital markets  inc had been retained as financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of strategic alternatives for the company s investment in del tin fiber 
subsequently  deltic s management and board of directors completed its review of these strategic alternatives and announced the company intended to exit the mdf business upon the earliest  reasonable opportunity provided by the market 
as a result of this decision  the company s evaluation of possible impairment of the carrying value of its investment in the joint venture was based primarily upon the estimated cash flows from a possible sale of the company s interest during and resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december  the investment was written off  to zero  and the write off amounted to million before income taxes 
due to the company s commitment to fund its share of any of the facility s operating working capital needs until the facility was able to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements or deltic s ownership was sold  the company recognized equity in del tin fiber equal to the extent of these advances during for the year of  such advances approximated the company s equity share of losses for the plant 
accordingly  the investment in del tin fiber at december  was zero 
the company also continued to utilize its management resources to work with del tin s management and the joint venture partner to improve operating performance at the plant 
as a result of these improvements  on december   deltic s board of directors revised its intent regarding the company s investment in del tin fiber and ceased efforts to sell the company s interest in the joint venture  while continuing to focus on improving operating and financial results of the plant 
due to this decision  the evaluation of fair value for the investment was based primarily upon the future net cash flows from del tin fiber s operations over the remaining life of the plant 
in  the company began recording its equity share of the operating results of the joint venture

outlook deltic s management believes that cash provided from its operations  the remaining amount available under its credit facility  and its ability to access the credit markets  will be sufficient to meet its expected cash needs and planned expenditures  including those of the company s continued timberland acquisition and stock repurchase programs  and capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future 

table of contents the preceding discussion of the company s liquidity and capital resources contains forward looking statements which were made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements reflect the company s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operating results during the three years ended december  the company s timber operations are more significantly impacted by the forces of supply and demand in the southern united states than by changes in inflation 
lumber manufacturing operations are affected by the supply of lumber available in the north american market and by the demand for lumber by both the north american and foreign export markets 
sales of real estate are affected by changes in the general economy and long term interest rates  specifically as such may manifest themselves in the central arkansas region 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments  either derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
the company handles market risks in accordance with its established policies  however  deltic does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company does  on occasion  consider the need to enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates  however  the company entered into no such instruments during the three year period ended december  deltic held various financial instruments at december  and  consisting of financial assets and liabilities reported in the company s consolidated balance sheets and off balance sheet exposures resulting from contractual debt guarantees and letters of credit issued for the benefit of deltic  primarily in connection with its purchased stumpage procurement and real estate operations 
for additional information regarding these financial instruments  refer to the previous tabular summary of the company s other commercial commitment expirations and to note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments  such as term debt and other borrowings 
the fair market value of long term  fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the instruments fair value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the estimated fair values of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  contractual guarantees of debt  and letters of credit at december   were million  
million  and 
million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in decreases in the estimated fair value of long term debt of million  while the fair value of contractual guarantees and the company s letters of credit would be unchanged 
fair values were determined using the current rates at which the company could enter into comparable financial instruments with similar remaining maturities 
there was no impact for resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates on the estimated pretax earnings and cash flows  holding other variables constant 
foreign exchange rate risk the company currently has no exposure to foreign exchange rate risk because all of its financial instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk the company has no financial instruments subject to commodity price risk 

table of contents equity security price risk none of the company s financial instruments have potential exposure to equity security price risk 
the preceding discussion of the company s estimated fair value of its financial instruments and the sensitivity analyses resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements reflect the company s current expectations and involve uncertainties 
these forward looking market risk disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impact from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact deltic s business as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity security prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified seven of its current accounting policies as being  in management s view  critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  six of these policies require significant assumptions and or estimates on the part of management as it pertains to certain factors inherent in the policies 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
deltic has not made any material changes to its critical accounting estimates in the last three years 
these policies  along with explanations of the key assumptions and or estimates considered by management  are described below 
for a listing of all significant accounting policies of the company  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment in real estate held for development and sale real estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs  including amenities 
indirect and amenity costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value 
direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis  while indirect costs for the company s three development areas chenal valley  chenal downs  and red oak ridge are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail values 
the key factors involved in determining the investment in real estate held for development and sale are the treatment of the clubhouse and golf course at chenal country club  the amenity around which the chenal valley development is centered  as an amenity rather than an operating fixed asset and the management estimates required to estimate the future indirect development costs and sales values of the areas of chenal valley yet to be developed 
due to accounting for chenal country club as an amenity  the cost of the clubhouse and golf course  including the estimated cost of planned future improvements  are charged against income as real estate is sold rather than depreciating this cost 
this amenity treatment also records the initiation fees received from members joining the club as a reduction in the cost basis of the club rather than as net sales 
in addition  the company s model for allocating the indirect cost to be expensed against each piece of real estate sold requires management to estimate the future indirect costs to be incurred for the entire development  primarily infrastructure costs and future improvements at chenal country club net of estimated future initiation fees to be received  as well as the potential market value of each tract of undeveloped property within the chenal valley development 
in determining future indirect development costs  management relies on cost projections for its development plans provided by independent professional engineering consultants 
independent appraisers are utilized to provide the potential market value for unsold acreage 
investment in del tin fiber investment in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a percent owned limited liability company  is carried at cost and is adjusted for the company s proportionate share of del tin fiber s undistributed earnings or losses 
the company s equity method basis carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber is evaluated for possible impairment  as 
table of contents applicable under the requirements of accounting principles board opinion apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this evaluation as of december   based on the intent of the company s board of directors to exit the business  resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december   and the carrying amount of the investment was written off  to zero  for the consolidated balance sheet 
on december   the company s board of directors revised its intent in regard to selling deltic s interest in the joint venture 
the resulting evaluation of fair value for the related investment indicated that fair value exceeded carrying value  which was zero as of december   and the company resumed recording its equity share of the operating results of del tin fiber 
likewise  cash advances to the joint venture are recorded as increases in the company s investment in the facility  while cash distributions received from the joint venture are reflected as reductions in its investment 
for deltic s investment in del tin fiber  the key determinations by management are the accounting treatment for this investment under the equity method of accounting rather than as a consolidated subsidiary since the joint venture is percent owned by both owners  the factors used in evaluating the impairment of the investment s carrying value  and the estimate of the fair value of the company s guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement 
deltic management has determined that there is no control by either company due to having a board of managers with equal representation 
as such  the assets and liabilities of del tin fiber are not included in the amounts reported on the company s balance sheet for any period 
in evaluating the possibility of the existence of an impairment for the company s carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber under apb  management must estimate future net cash flows from the possible courses of action available for its investment  such as continuing to maintain or sell its investment  to determine both recoverability of the carrying amount and fair value of the investment 
more specifically  management must determine the possible courses of action and estimate the probability of each potential action  as well as the related future net cash flows 
then  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  management must determine if this impairment is other than temporary 
if so  then an impairment write down is required 
in estimating the fair value of the guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement  deltic s management must first assess how the same debt instrument would have been structured without the guarantees of the joint venture partners  in order to estimate the benefit resulting from deltic s guarantee 
a range of probabilities of estimated future cash outflows under the benefit previously determined are then assembled 
a probability weighted present value of the estimated future cash outflows is then calculated 
the resulting balance represents the fair value of the obligation  which is the estimate of the value of assets required currently to settle the liability in the future

timber and timberlands timber and timberlands  which includes timberland  fee timber  purchased stumpage inventory and logging facilities  are stated at cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities and includes no estimated future reforestation cost 
the cost of timber consists of fee timber acquired and reforestation costs  which includes site preparation  seedlings  and labor 
the cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable 
logging facilities  which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements  are depreciated using the straight line method over a ten year estimated life 
the company estimates its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
fee timber carrying costs  commercial thinning  silviculture and timberland management costs are expensed as incurred 
the company classifies its timberlands and fee timber as either strategic or non strategic 
strategic timberland including pine forest and pine plantations are prime pine sawtimber growing platforms located within or immediately adjacent to the company sawmill s operating regions 
deltic manages these acres using modern silviculture methods to achieve optimal volume and quality of its pine sawtimber 
the company harvests sawtimber and pulpwood in accordance with 
table of contents its harvest plans and generally converts sawtimber into lumber in its own sawmills and sells pulpwood in the market 
upon harvest  strategic timberlands are reforested 
the company s timberland acquisition program is focused on the acquisition of timberland in its current operating regions 
the company considers the acquisition and the occasional sale of strategic timberlands as investing activities 
the company has legacy hardwood and other acreage which can not be harvested for conversion in company sawmills  reforested as pine plantations  or both 
these legacy timberlands have been identified as non strategic and or higher and better use timberlands and are expected to be sold over time 
the woodlands segment manages an annual program to sell a portion of these non strategic timberlands and or harvest hardwoods for the sale to third parties 
the company considers this program as an operating activity of its woodlands segment 
in order to acquire and sell assets  primarily timberlands  in a tax efficient manner  the company enters into like kind exchange lke tax deferred transactions 
the company generally enters into forward transactions  in which property is sold and the proceeds are reinvested by acquiring similar property  and reverse transactions  in which property is acquired and similar property is subsequently sold 
a qualified lke intermediary is used to facilitate lke transactions 
proceeds from forward lke transactions are held by the intermediary and are classified as restricted cash because the funds must be reinvested in similar properties 
if the acquisition of suitable lke properties is not completed within days of the sale of the company owned property  the proceeds are distributed to us by the intermediary and are reclassified as available cash and applicable income taxes are determined 
amounts deposited with a third party towards the potential future purchase of property are included in other investments and non current receivables in the consolidated balance sheets and as an investing activity in funds held by trustee in the consolidated statements of cash flow 
at december  and  the company had million and 
million  respectively  of proceeds from land sales deposited with a lke intermediary 
the key components of the timber and timberlands policy are management s decision to maintain separate timber cost pools for each legal entity within the deltic consolidated group and the required estimation of timber inventory volume  by species  for each of these companies in order to calculate the cost of fee timber harvested per ton 
management has elected to maintain a separate cost pool for the timber owned by each company  thus resulting in a different cost per ton for fee timber harvested for each 
the mix of harvest by company for any period can significantly affect the amount of cost of fee timber harvested expense reported 
per ton costs for ranged from to per ton for pine sawtimber 
had the company opted to use a composite depletion rate  cost of pine sawtimber harvested would have been 
million less in  the same in  and 
million more in  
million  zero  and 
million  respectively  net of applicable income taxes than as reported due to the mix of harvest by company during the year 
in determining these rates  management must estimate the volume of timber existing on its timberlands 
to estimate these fee timber inventories  the company relies on its experienced forestry personnel and their use of statistical information and data obtained by actual physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the recognized cost of fee timber harvested is impacted by the accuracy of this volume estimation 
for additional information about the company s timber and timberlands  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of buildings  equipment  and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight line method 
expenditures that substantially improve and or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur 
property  plant  and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets  as applicable  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to 
table of contents be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
management also evaluates any asset or group of assets for which potential impairment might exist and has determined that there are none requiring an impairment write down 
this process requires management s estimate of future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets 
for any instance where this evaluation process might indicate impairment exists  the appropriate asset s carrying values would be written down to fair value and the amount of the write down would be charged against the results of continuing operations 
for additional information about the company s property  plant  and equipment  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  sfas r 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in future interim and annual reporting periods includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas  and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the results for prior periods have not been restated 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had an impact on the company s results of operations 
the consolidated statement of income for the years ended december    and  included   and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense reflected in general and administrative expenses 
sfas no 
r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under apb and related interpretations 
this requirement increased net financing cash flows  rather than net operating cash flows  for the years ended december    and  by   and  respectively 
the cumulative effect related to outstanding restricted stock awards as of december   which are not expected to vest based on an estimate of forfeitures  was not material 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
for valuation of stock options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  deltic elected to use a binomial model to estimate fair value 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant

deltic issues restricted stock performance units whose vesting is contingent upon meeting certain financial performance goals based upon the company s total stockholder return compared to the total return of a paper and forest products index the index selected by the compensation committee and calculated by standard and poor s 
determining the appropriate amount to expense is based on likelihood of achievement of the stated goals and requires judgement

the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change 
the company used historical volatility over the ten year trading life of its stock to determine volatility assumptions 
risk free interest rates are based on historical rates and forward looking factors 
the expected dividend yield is based on the company s average dividend yield from to the pre vesting forfeiture rate is based on historical rates and forward looking factors 
the expected option term is based on the term of the option and historical exercise  and expiration experience 
assumptions for the   and valuation of stock options and restricted stock performance units consisted of the following weighted expected volatility dividend yield expected term of options in years risk free interest rate revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
revenue from the sale of lumber and wood by products is recorded at the time of shipment due to terms of such sale being designated free on board fob shipping point 
revenue from the sale of timber cutting rights to third parties is recorded when legal title passes to the purchaser  which is generally upon delivery of a legally executed timber deed and receipt of payment for the timber 
revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded when the timber is harvested 
such intersegment sales  which are made at prices which generally approximate market  are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue from timberland and real estate sales is recorded under the criteria of the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for sales of real estate 
such revenue is recorded at the time the purchaser executes the real estate closing documents and makes payment to the title company handling the closing 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities  based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the key management decisions related to income taxes are the determination of current taxability of transactions  the election to capitalize or expense costs incurred  the decision regarding the appropriate depreciation method for income tax purposes these three factors ultimately affect the company s cash flows for income taxes paid and determine the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and management s estimation of the appropriateness of valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets that exist 
deltic s management periodically evaluates the company s ability to realize future benefit of deferred tax assets by reviewing the expected turnaround of deferred tax liabilities and the amount of future taxable income and by evaluating tax planning strategies that could possibly be implemented to realize deferred tax assets 

table of contents the company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various uncertain tax positions taken in our tax return
