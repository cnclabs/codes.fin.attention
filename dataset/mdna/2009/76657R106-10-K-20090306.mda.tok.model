overview rightnow technologies provides on demand customer relationship management software and services that help consumer centric organizations improve customer experiences  while reducing costs 
in today s competitive business environment  we believe providing superior customer experiences can be a powerful way for companies to drive sustainable differentiation 
rightnow s technology enables an organization s service  marketing and sales personnel to leverage a common application platform to deliver service  to market and to sell via the phone  email  web and chat 
additionally  through our on demand delivery approach  or software as a service saas  we are able to eliminate much of the complexity associated with traditional on premise solutions  implement rapidly  and price our solutions at a level that results in a lower cost of ownership compared to on premise solutions 
our value added services  including business process optimization and lifetime product tune ups  are directed toward improving our customers efficiency  increasing user adoption and assisting our customers to maximize the return on their investment 
approximately  corporations and government agencies worldwide depend on rightnow to achieve their strategic objectives and better meet the needs of those they serve 
we released our initial version of rightnow service in this product addressed the new customer service needs resulting from the increasing use of the internet as a customer service channel 
since then  we have significantly enhanced product features and functionality to address customer service needs across multiple communication channels  including web  interactive voice  email  chat  telephone and proactive outbound email communications 
we have also added several products that are complementary to our rightnow service solution  including rightnow marketing  rightnow sales and rightnow feedback which automate aspects of marketing campaigns  sales operations  and customer monitoring 
in february  we released rightnow  our newest enterprise class solution for service  sales and marketing 
to date  approximately to of our software  hosting and support revenue has been generated by the rightnow service suite 
business model changes to better align with industry practice  beginning in we changed our product offerings from software license arrangements to subscription service arrangements eg subscriptions 
as the industry and business models for software as a service or on demand have evolved  the standard form of sales arrangements are service agreements rather than licenses of software that can be hosted 
we believe providing offerings in this manner will assist with our market penetration 
accordingly  our terms of sale have been revised to provide a hosting service where the customer accesses the software and data through the internet 
our previous terms of sale provided the customer a software license  and for no additional fee the customer could choose to have the software hosted by us  by themselves or by someone else 
revenue recognition for service arrangements is not materially different from our previous term license arrangements  as revenue under either type of contract is generally recognized ratably over the period of the agreement 
as a result of this change  the amount of deferred revenue on the balance sheet under subscription arrangements decreased since only 
table of contents the amount currently due from the customer is recorded to accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
conversely  under software license arrangements  the full customer commitment is recorded to receivables and deferred revenue 
as part of this business model change  we essentially discontinued sales of perpetual software licenses which represented of our revenue in as compared to approximately in  and less than in although we expect to ultimately increase the lifetime value of our customer arrangements through sales of subscriptions  the substantive elimination of perpetual license sales materially and adversely impacted our operating results for and when compared to prior years  as perpetual revenue has generally been recognized in full upon delivery of the license 
lastly  our policy for subscription contract acquisition costs  such as sales commissions  is to recognize them in proportion to the revenue recognized under the subscription arrangement 
since the majority of new business was subscriptions in and  we believe this policy had a material and beneficial impact on our operating results  respectively 
sales incentives paid on license sales and professional services continue to be expensed when earned  which is typically at the time the related sale is invoiced 
sources of revenue our revenue is comprised of fees for software  hosting and support  and fees for professional services 
recurring revenue  referred to in this report  includes software  hosting and support revenue from term license and subscription agreements 
software  hosting and support revenue includes fees earned under subscriptions and software license arrangements 
subscription arrangements include a bundled fee to access the software and data through our hosting services  and support services 
subscription revenue is recorded ratably over the length of the agreement 
our hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of our software and customers data which is physically located in third party facilities 
customers access hosted software and data through a secure internet connection 
support services include technical assistance for our software products and unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
license arrangements can be over time a term license or perpetual 
for term licenses  software  hosting and support revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
perpetual license revenue is generally recorded in full upon delivery of the license  and the hosting and support elements are recognized ratably over the contractual period 
perpetual license revenue ranged from to of our total revenue from through due to the change in our business model noted above  perpetual license revenue decreased from million  or of revenue in the year ending december  to million  or of revenue in the year ending december   to  or less than of revenue in the year ending december  our sales arrangements generally provide customers with the right to use our software up to a maximum number of users or transactions 
a number of our arrangements provide for additional fees for usage above the maximum  which are billed and recognized into revenue when determinable and earned 
professional services revenue is comprised of revenue from consulting  education  development services  and reimbursement of related travel costs 
consulting and education services include implementation and best practices consulting 
development services include customizations and integrations for a client s specific business application 
professional services revenue was approximately of total revenue during and  and increased to in professional services are typically sold with initial sales arrangements and at times over the client engagement 
our typical education courses are billed on a per person  per class basis 
depending on the size and complexity of the client project  our consulting or development services contracts are either fixed price fixed scope or  more frequently  billed on a time and materials basis 
we have determined that the professional services element of our software and subscription arrangements is not essential to the functionality of the software 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and related expenses such as employee benefits  stock based compensation and payroll taxes for our hosting  support and professional services organizations  third party costs and equipment depreciation relating to our hosting services  third party costs for voice enabled crm applications  travel expenses related to providing professional services to our clients  amortization of acquired intangible assets and allocated overhead 
we allocate most overhead expenses  such as office supplies  computer supplies  utilities  rent  depreciation for furniture and equipment  payroll taxes and employee benefits  based on headcount 
as a result  these common overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing  including commissions and bonuses  advertising  marketing events  corporate communications  product management expenses  travel costs and allocated overhead 
for subscription arrangements  we expense the related sales commission in proportion to the revenue recognized 
we expense our sales commissions on license arrangements when earned  which is typically at the time the related sale is invoiced to the client 
since the majority of our historical revenue has been from license arrangements recognized over time  we have experienced a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of corresponding revenue 
we expect to increase our sales  and to accomplish this we plan to appropriately segment our sales and marketing teams  and potentially hire additional sales and marketing personnel and increase the level of marketing activities 

table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products  enhancement of existing products  translation fees  quality assurance  testing and allocated overhead 
to date  we have not capitalized internal software development costs because the timing of the commercial releases of our products has substantially coincided with the attainment of technological feasibility 
we intend to continue to expand and enhance our product offerings 
to accomplish this  we plan to efficiently utilize existing personnel  hire additional personnel and  from time to time  contract with third parties 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we seek to expand our technology and product offerings 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for management  finance and accounting  legal  information systems and human resources personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we anticipate that we will incur additional employee salaries and related expenses  professional service fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates these estimates on an on going basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment  and management believes these estimates to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate 
illiquid credit markets  volatile equity  foreign currency  and declines in consumer spending have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
these assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of receivables and deferred tax assets  and accounting for share based compensation 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include elements comprising our software  hosting and support sales arrangements and whether the elements have stand alone and or fair value  whether the fees charged for our products and services are fixed or determinable  the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets  estimates regarding the recoverability and respective fair value of auction rate securities and all other investments  valuation allowances for receivables and deferred income tax assets  and estimates of expected term and volatility in determining stock based compensation expense 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
revenue recognition beginning in  we changed the nature of our sales arrangements from license arrangements to subscription arrangements subscriptions 
for a bundled fee  subscriptions provide the customer with access to the software and data over the internet  or on demand  and provide technical support services and software upgrades when and if available 
under subscriptions  customers do not have the right to take possession of the software and  in accordance with eitf such arrangements are considered service contracts which are outside the scope of sop accordingly  we account for sales of subscriptions under sab and eitf we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the length of the agreement and professional services are recognized as incurred based on their relative fair values  in accordance with eitf prior to  we sold the majority of products under software license arrangements licenses and accounted for them in accordance with sop and sop licenses generally include multiple elements that are delivered up front or over time 
for example  under a term license  we deliver the software up front and provide hosting and support services over time 
fair value for each element in a license does not exist since none are sold separately  and consequently  the bundled revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
under a perpetual license  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the hosting and support elements is based on the price charged at renewal when sold separately  and therefore the license element is recognized immediately into revenue upon delivery using the residual method  and the hosting and support elements are recognized ratably over the contractual term 
the application of these rules requires judgment  including the identification of individual elements in multiple element arrangements  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  including vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  for some or all elements 
changes to the elements in our sales arrangements  or our ability to establish vsoe or fair value for those elements may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
fees charged for professional services are recognized when delivered 
we believe the fees for professional services qualify for separate accounting because a the services have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  b objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for these services  and c performance of the services is considered probable and does not involve unique customer acceptance criteria 
our standard payment terms are net  although payment within days is considered normal 
we periodically provide extended payment terms and we consider any fees due beyond days to not be fixed or determinable 
in such cases  judgment is required in determining the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
changes to our practice of providing extended payment terms or providing concessions following a sale  may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess the collectability of outstanding customer invoices and  in so doing  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current creditworthiness  customer concentration  age of the receivable balance  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates and exceed our related loss allowance 
income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
when applicable  a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding the realization of our net operating loss carry forwards  tax credits  and deductible timing differences 
the uncertainty of realizing these benefits is based primarily on our lack of taxable earnings 
effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin and it did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
fin requires judgment when evaluating tax positions 
our judgment includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of our material positions taken on tax return filings 
the ultimate resolution of tax issues may result in a significant change to our recorded tax assets and liabilities 
share based compensation we record share based payment arrangements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r requires the cost of share based payment arrangements to be recorded in the statement of operations 
prior to  the estimated cost of share based payment arrangements was disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements 
share based compensation amounts are affected by our stock price as well as our assumptions regarding the expected volatility of our stock  our employee stock option exercise behaviors  forfeitures  and the related income tax effects 
our assumptions are based primarily on our historical information  some of which was developed when we were a private company 
recently issued accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies when other accounting pronouncements require fair value measurements  it does not require new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
on february   fsp fas was issued delaying the effective date of sfas no 
until fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the adoption of sfas has not had a material effect on our financial statements 
we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements 
the guidance in fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  this statement provides companies with an option to report selected assets and liabilities principally financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities  and does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards 
the adoption of sfas has not had a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r requires the use of full fair value to record all the identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the requirements are effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas r may have a material effect on our financial statements to the extent the company pursues future business combinations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas requires the noncontrolling interests minority interests to be recorded at fair value and reported as a component of equity 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the requirements are effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements

within software  hosting and support  recurring revenue increased in over  which was offset by a decrease of million to  in perpetual license revenue 
the decline in perpetual license revenue resulted from our business model change during in which we essentially eliminated sales of new perpetual licenses 
recurring revenue increased in due to growth in average revenue per customer 
revenue per customer increased primarily due to higher average selling price per customer and growth in the number of customers 
sales to customers with annual revenues greater than billion and the public sector made up approximately of total revenue in  compared to approximately of total revenue in and in 
table of contents during we continued to invest in our operations by adding professional services personnel and partners to support our solution offerings  sales and marketing personnel to focus on new customer acquisition  added capacity to support our hosting operations  research and development personnel to focus on solution development  administrative personnel to support operations 
these investments caused total expenses to increase in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of revenue during total revenue growth combined with improved leverage in our business model and the increased focus on operating expenses resulted in an operating loss improvement from a loss as a percentage of revenue of in to a loss as a percentage of revenue of in we were impacted by the strength of the us dollar predominantly in the third and fourth quarters of relative to the british pound  euro  and australian dollar 
although we report our actual results in us dollars  we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than us dollars 
therefore  we discuss constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
constant currency discussions herein are based on comparison to currency exchange rates during the prior year 
for example  total revenue in increased by million  or over total revenue reported in if currency exchange rates in had remained constant with rates  revenue in would have increased approximately by an additional  or a further 
in other words  the change in exchange rates between and had a negative impact to revenue of approximately  or 
using the same methodology  the change in exchange rates between and had a negative impact on deferred revenue of million or 
expenses associated with international revenue are generally paid in local currency  which generally provides a natural hedge to offset the revenue impact 
these expenses in decreased million on a constant currency basis as compared to the respective weighted average exchange rates during the year ended december  total revenue in increased by million  or over total revenue reported in the change in exchange rates between and had a positive impact to revenue of million  or 
the expenses associated with international revenue increased million on a constant currency basis as compared to the respective weighted average exchange rates during the year ended december  for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations compared to million of cash in our cash and investments balances decreased to million at december  from million one year earlier  which was primarily due to the use of million to repurchase shares of our common stock under our october  board approved stock repurchase program

the mix of perpetual license revenue affects our profitability in any given period since it is recorded in full into revenue upon delivery instead of being recorded ratably into revenue over time  as is the case with subscriptions and term licenses 
professional services revenue increased million  or  in over we believe the growth in professional services revenue is primarily due to larger project implementations  as a result of the release of rightnow  which has created expanded opportunities within the

our investment portfolio consists primarily of investment grade government  corporate debt instruments  and auction rate securities 
other income expense consists primarily of losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  and an other than temporary impairment loss on auction rate securities 
these losses were primarily offset by a gain on a put option settlement right associated with the auction rate securities

currency transaction losses were offset by currency transaction gains predominantly in the third and fourth quarter of over provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of  in   in  and  in  consists primarily of the federal alternative minimum tax  foreign withholding taxes  and various state income taxes 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards  tax credits  federal alternative minimum taxes  foreign rate differentials  and non deductible meal and entertainment expenses 
our effective tax rate in will depend on a number of factors  such as the amount and mix of stock based compensation expense to be recorded under sfas r  the level of business in state and foreign tax jurisdictions  management s expectation of the realization of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance  and other factors 
at december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets that have been reserved in full by a valuation allowance 
in the future  if available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets are realizable  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance would decrease income tax expense  in the period such determination was made 
if and when that happens  our effective income tax rate will increase to more closely approximate the federal statutory rate

we typically bill customers on net day terms at the beginning of the contract period  which is reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
cash flow from operations can vary significantly from year to year for many reasons  including the timing of business in a given period  and customer payment preferences and patterns 
slower cash collections and mix of billing terms were the primary drivers in the decline in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to during the third and fourth quarters of  the percentage of business signed with monthly or periodic billing terms increased from historical rates of to approximately 
deferred revenue is not recorded for subscriptions with monthly or periodic billing terms until the invoices are issued 
a change in the billing practice resulting in delayed payment or billing terms could have a material adverse effect on cash provided from operating activities and growth in deferred revenue 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable represented approximately of current accounts and term receivables at december  and  respectively 
accounts written off in were relatively constant as a percentage of new billings from the previous year

our portfolio is investment grade and diversified among issuers and security types to reduce credit risk 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a large portion of our investment portfolio in instruments with short maturities or frequent interest rate resets
