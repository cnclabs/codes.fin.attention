competition the company faces significant competition in making loans and attracting deposits 
wisconsin has many banks  savings banks  and savings and loan associations  which offer the same types of banking products as the company 
wisconsin also has an extensive tax exempt credit union industry  whose expanded powers have resulted in increased competition within the financial services industry 
many of the company s competitors have greater resources and or offer services that the company currently does not provide 
for example  the company does not offer trust services 
however  the company does offer mutual fund investments  tax deferred annuities  credit life and disability insurance  property and casualty insurance  brokerage services  and investment advisory services through a subsidiary  bancmutual financial insurance services  inc in addition  the banking business in the milwaukee area  the company s largest market  tends to be dominated by the two largest commercial banks in the state  which together had approximately of all deposits held by fdic insured institutions in the milwaukee area at june  most of the company s competition for loans traditionally has come from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  and credit unions 
increasingly  other types of companies  such as mortgage brokerage firms  finance companies  insurance companies  and other providers of financial services also compete for these products 
for deposits  the company competes with traditional financial institutions  mutual funds particularly short term money market funds  brokerage firms  and insurance companies 
the recent increase in electronic commerce also increases competition from institutions and other entities outside of wisconsin

table of contents residential mortgage lending the company originates and purchases first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties located in its primary market areas 
most of these loans are owner occupied  however  the company also originates first mortgage loans secured by second homes  seasonal homes  and investment properties 
the company reviews most of the loans it purchases from third party originators for compliance with its internal underwriting standards 
in certain instances the company has delegated loan approval authority to the third party originators provided such originators utilize the federal national mortgage association fannie mae desktop underwriting system 
in such cases  the company reviews of the mortgage loans purchased from these third party originators for compliance with the company s underwriting standards 
the company originates primarily conventional fixed rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with maturity dates up to years 
such loans generally are underwritten to fannie mae standards 
in general  arm loans are retained by the company in its loan portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans are generally sold in the secondary market without recourse  although the company typically retains the servicing rights to such loans 
from time to time  the company may elect to retain in its loan portfolio conventional fixed rate loans with maturities of up to years  as well as certain loans with maturities up to years 
as a result of market competition in recent years  the company has generally not charged loan origination fees 
the interest rates charged on mortgage loan originations at any given date will vary  depending upon conditions in the local and secondary markets 
the company also originates jumbo single family mortgage loans in excess of the fannie mae maximum loan amount  which was  for one to four family homes in fannie mae has higher limits for two  three and four family homes 
beginning in  the company began to retain certain fixed rate jumbo mortgage loans in its portfolio 
arm jumbo mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with the company s underwriting guidelines and are retained in its loan portfolio 
the company also originates loans under programs administered by the state veteran s administration state va  the wisconsin housing and economic development authority wheda  the us department of agriculture usda guaranteed rural housing program  and beginning in  the federal housing administration fha 
loans originated under state va  wheda  and usda programs are not held by the company in its loan portfolio  although the company retains the servicing rights for such loans 
in the case of fha loans  the company receives a fee for its origination services  but does not retain the loan or the servicing rights for such loans 
the company also originates fixed rate mortgage loans under special programs for low to moderate income households and first time home buyers 
these programs are offered for community reinvestment act cra purposes and are retained by the company in its loan portfolio 
among the features of these programs are lower down payments  no mortgage insurance  and generally less restrictive requirements for qualification compared to the company s conventional one to four family mortgage loans 
for instance  certain of these programs currently provide for loans with up to loan to value ratios without private mortgage insurance 
these loans generally have maturities up to years 
the average size of one to four family mortgage loans originated by the company in was  and in and was  and  respectively 
arm loans pose credit risks different from the risks inherent in fixed rate loans  primarily because as interest rates rise  the underlying payments from the borrowers increase  which increases the potential for payment default 
at the same time  the marketability and or value of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
arm loans originated by the company are typically adjusted by a maximum of basis points per adjustment period 
the adjustments are usually annual  after the initial interest rate lock period 
the company originates arm loans with lifetime caps set at above the origination rate 
monthly payments of principal and interest are adjusted when the interest rate adjusts 
the company does not offer arm loans with negative amortization 
the initial rates offered on arm loans fluctuate with general interest rate changes and are determined by competitive conditions and the company s yield requirements 
the company currently utilizes the monthly average yield on united states treasury securities  adjusted to a constant maturity of one year constant maturity treasury index as the index to determine the interest rate payable upon the adjustment date of arm loans 
some of the arm loans are granted with conversion options that provide terms under which the borrower may convert the mortgage loan to a fixed rate mortgage loan for a limited period early in the term normally in the first five years of the arm loan 
the terms at which the arm loan may be converted to a fixed rate loan are established at the date of loan origination and are set at a level allowing the company to sell the loan into the secondary market upon conversion 
in addition  some arm loans are granted on an interest only basis whereby the borrower pays interest only during the initial one  two  three  or five year interest rate lock period 
upon the first interest rate adjustment  
table of contents principal amortization begins for the remaining term of the loan 
at december   of the company s one to four family mortgage loan portfolio consisted of interest only mortgage loans 
the volume and types of arm loans the company originates have been affected by the level of market interest rates  competition  consumer preferences  and the availability of funds 
although the company will continue to offer arm loans  it cannot guarantee that it will be able to originate a sufficient volume of arm loans to increase or maintain the proportion that these loans bear to the company s total loans 
arm loans are susceptible to early prepayment during periods of lower interest rates as borrowers refinance into fixed rate loans 
residential mortgage loan originations are solicited from real estate brokers  builders  existing customers  community groups  other referral sources  and residents of the local communities located in the company s primary market areas through its loan origination staff 
the company also advertises its residential mortgage loan products through local media  internal customer communications  and its website 
most residential mortgage loans are processed under the fannie mae alternative documentation programs 
for reduced documentation loans  the company requires applicants to complete a fannie mae loan application and requests income  asset and debt information from the borrower 
in addition to obtaining outside vendor credit reports on all borrowers  the company also looks at other information to ascertain the creditworthiness of the borrower 
in most instances  the company utilizes fannie mae s desktop underwriter automated underwriting process to further reduce the necessary documentation 
for example  a telephone verification of employment may be used instead of written verification of employment 
loans that are processed with reduced documentation conform to secondary market standards and generally may be sold on the secondary market 
alternative documentation should not be confused with no documentation loans no doc loans 
no doc loans  as the name implies  do not require verification of employment  instead stated income is used 
the company does not offer no doc loans  nor does it originate or purchase subprime loans 
normally  an appraisal of the real estate to secure a mortgage loan is required  which must be performed by a certified appraiser approved by the board of directors 
the company may also utilize a streamlined process in certain circumstances on existing mortgage loans that refinance with the company 
in such instances  the company may rely on the original appraisal and in essence the only items that are modified are the rate and term 
a title insurance policy is required for all real estate first mortgage loans 
evidence of adequate hazard insurance and flood insurance  if applicable  is required prior to closing 
borrowers are required to make monthly payments to fund principal and interest except for the interest only arm mortgage loans as well as private mortgage insurance and flood insurance  if applicable 
with some exceptions for lower loan to value ratio loans  borrowers are also generally required to escrow in advance for real estate taxes 
if borrowers with loans having a lower loan to value ratio want to handle their taxes and insurance themselves  an escrow waiver fee is charged 
the company makes disbursements for these items from the escrow account as the obligations become due 
with respect to escrowed real estate taxes  the company generally makes this disbursement directly to the borrower 
the company s staff underwriters review all pertinent information prior to making a credit decision to approve or deny an application 
all recommendations to deny are reviewed by a designated senior officer of the company  in addition to staff underwriters  prior to the final disposition of the loan application 
the company s lending policies generally limit the maximum loan to value ratio on one to four family mortgage loans secured by owner occupied properties to of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property 
loans above loan to value ratios are subject to private mortgage insurance 
coverage is required to reduce the company s exposure to less than of value except for certain low to moderate income loan program loans 
in addition to servicing the loans in its own portfolio  the company continues to service most of the loans that it sells to fannie mae and other third party investors commonly referred to as loans serviced for others 
servicing mortgage loans  whether for its own portfolio or for others  includes such functions as collecting monthly principal and interest payments from borrowers  maintaining escrow accounts for real estate taxes and insurance  and making such payments on behalf of borrowers when they are due or in the case of escrowed real estate taxes  making payments directly to the borrowers 
when necessary  servicing of mortgage loans also includes functions related to the collection of delinquent principal and interest payments  loan foreclosure proceedings  and disposition of foreclosed real estate 
as of december   loans serviced for others amounted to million compared to million at the end of the previous year 
these loans are not reflected in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
when the company services loans for others  it is compensated for these services through the retention of a servicing fee from borrowers monthly payments 
the company pays the third party investors an agreed upon yield on the loans  which is generally less than the interest agreed to be paid by the borrowers 
the difference  typically 
table of contents basis points or more  is retained by the company and recognized as servicing fee income over the lives of the loans  net of amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights msrs 
the company also receives fees and interest income from ancillary sources such as delinquency charges and float on escrow and other funds 
management believes that servicing mortgage loans for third parties provides a natural hedge against other risks inherent in the company s mortgage banking operations 
for example  fluctuations in volumes of mortgage loan originations and resulting gains on sales of such loans caused by changes in market interest rates will be offset to a certain extent by opposite changes in the amortization of the msrs 
these fluctuations are usually the result of actual loan prepayment activity and or changes in management expectations for future prepayment activity  which impacts the amount of msrs amortized in a given period 
however  fluctuations in the recorded value of msrs may also be caused by valuation adjustments required to be recognized under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
that is  the value of servicing rights may fluctuate because of changes in the future prepayment assumptions or discount rates used to periodically value the msrs 
although management believes that most of the company s loans that prepay are replaced by a new loan to the same customer or even a different customer thus preserving the future servicing cash flow  gaap requires impairment losses resulting from a change in future prepayment assumptions to be recorded in the period in which the change occurs 
however  the offsetting gain on the sale of the new loan  if any  cannot be recorded under gaap until the customer actually prepays the old loan and the new loan is sold in the secondary market 
mortgage servicing rights are particularly susceptible to impairment losses during periods of declining interest rates during which prepayment activity typically accelerates to levels above that which had been anticipated when the servicing rights were originally recorded 
alternatively  in periods of increasing interest rates  during which prepayment activity typically declines  the company could potentially recapture through earnings all or a portion of a previously established valuation allowance for impairment 
as of december   the net carrying value of the company s msrs was million compared to million at december  for additional discussion  refer to part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as notes and of the company s consolidated financial statements 
consumer loans in recent periods  the company has emphasized consumer loan originations because they generally offer higher yields and because the company has experienced relatively low delinquency and few losses on such products 
in addition  the company believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to its existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross marketing opportunities 
consumer loan products offered within the company s market areas include fixed term home equity loans  home equity lines of credit  home improvement loans  automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  marine loans  deposit account loans  overdraft protection lines of credit  unsecured consumer loans  and to a lesser extent  unsecured consumer loans through credit card programs that are administered by third parties 
in the company ceased offering student loans through programs guaranteed by the federal government due to a lack of profitability 
student loans that continue to be held by the company are administered by a third party 
the company s primary focus in consumer lending has been the origination of home equity loans  home improvement loans  and home equity lines of credit 
underwriting procedures for the home equity and home equity lines of credit loans include a comprehensive review of the loan application  an acceptable credit score  verification of the value of the equity in the home  and verification of the borrower s income 
the loan to value ratio and the total debt to income ratio are two of the most important determining factors in the underwriting process 
home equity loan and home improvement loan originations are developed through the use of direct mail  cross sales to existing customers  advertisements in local media  and the bank s website 
the company originates both fixed rate and variable rate home equity loans and home improvement loans with combined loan to value ratios up to 
pricing on fixed rate home equity and home improvement loans is periodically reviewed by management 
generally  loan terms are in the three to fifteen year range in order to minimize interest rate risk 
during  the company originated million of fixed rate home equity or home improvement loans  these loans carry a weighted average written term of approximately years and a fixed rate ranging from to 
during  the company originated approximately million of fixed rate home equity or home improvement loans  carrying a weighted average written term of approximately years and a fixed rate ranging from to 
the company also offers adjustable rate home equity and home improvement loans 
at december   million or of the company s fixed term home equity and home improvement loan portfolio carried an adjustable rate 
the adjustable rate loans have an initial fixed rate for one to three years then adjust annually or monthly depending upon the offering  with terms of up to years 
total disbursed home equity credit line loans were million  or of total consumer loans at december  these are adjustable rate loans secured by a first or second mortgage on owner occupied one to four family 
table of contents residences and second homes located primarily in the state of wisconsin 
current interest rates on home equity credit lines are tied to the prime rate  adjust monthly after an initial interest rate lock period  and range from prime rate minus basis points to prime rate plus basis points  depending on the loan to value ratio 
these loans generally have a floor of 
home equity line of credit loans are made for terms up to years and require a minimum monthly payment of interest only with a minimum payment of an annual fee is charged on home equity lines of credit 
prior to may  the company made indirect automobile  boat  and recreational vehicle loans through applications taken by selected automobile dealerships on application forms approved by the company 
the company discontinued such indirect loan originations as a result of the reduced profitability of these loans 
consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher rates of interest than conventional mortgage loans  but typically involve more credit risk than such loans because of the nature of the collateral and  in some instances  the absence of collateral 
in general  consumer loans are more dependent upon the borrower s continuing financial stability  more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances  and often secured by rapidly depreciating personal property such as automobiles 
in addition  various laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that may be recovered from a borrower 
however  such risks are mitigated to some extent in the case of home equity loans and lines of credit 
these types of loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence for which the total principal balance outstanding including the first mortgage does not generally exceed of the property s value at the time of the loan 
the company believes that the higher yields earned on consumer loans compensate for the increased risk associated with such loans and that consumer loans are important to the company s efforts to increase the interest rate sensitivity and shorten the average maturity of its loan portfolio 
furthermore  the company s net charge offs on consumer loans as a percentage of gross loans have not been significant in recent years  despite the risks inherent in consumer lending 
in conjunction with its consumer lending activities  the company offers customers credit life and disability insurance products underwritten and administered by an independent insurance provider 
the company receives commission revenue related to the sales of these products  although such amounts are not a material source of revenue for the company 
multi family and commercial real estate loans the company s multi family and commercial real estate loan portfolios consist of fixed rate and adjustable rate loans originated at prevailing market rates usually tied to various treasury indices 
this portfolio generally consists of loans secured by apartment buildings  office buildings  warehouses  industrial buildings  and retail centers 
these loans typically do not exceed of the lesser of the purchase price or an appraisal by an appraiser designated by us 
loans originated with balloon maturities are generally amortized on a to year basis with a typical balloon term of to years 
loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate are granted based on the income producing potential of the property and the financial strength of the borrower 
the net operating income  which is the income derived from the operation of the property or from the business in an owner occupied property  must be sufficient to cover the payments relating to the outstanding debt 
in most cases  the company obtains joint and several personal guarantees from the principals involved 
the company generally requires an assignment of rents or leases in order to be assured that the cash flow from the property will be used to repay the debt 
appraisals on properties securing multi family and larger commercial real estate loans are performed by independent state certified fee appraisers approved by the board of directors 
title and hazard insurance are required as well as flood insurance  if applicable 
environmental assessments are performed on certain multi family and commercial real estate loans in excess of million  as well as all loans secured by certain properties that the company considers to be environmentally sensitive 
in addition  an annual review is performed on non owner occupied multi family and commercial real estate loans over million 
at december   the largest outstanding loan on a multi family property was million on an apartment retail project located in madison  wisconsin 
at the same date  the largest commercial real estate loan outstanding was a million short term bridge loan secured by four medical office buildings located in the milwaukee area 
the second largest commercial real estate loan outstanding was a million permanent mortgage loan on a medical office complex located in the milwaukee area 
at december   these loans were current and performing in accordance with their terms 
these loans are substantially below the bank s legal lending limit to a single borrower  which was approximately million at december  however  the 
table of contents bank has an internal lending limit that is adjusted from time to time and which is substantially lower than its legal lending limit 
loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate properties are generally larger and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
such loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
because payments on loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties  repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
if the cash flow from the project decreases  or if leases are not obtained or renewed  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
construction and development loans the company s construction and development loans typically have terms of to months  are interest only  and carry variable interest rates tied to the prime rate 
disbursements on these loans are based on draw requests supported by appropriate lien waivers 
as a general matter  construction and development loans convert to permanent loans and remain in the company s loan portfolio upon the completion of the project 
construction loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than mortgage loans on completed properties 
the company s risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction  the estimated cost of construction  and the borrower s ability to advance additional construction funds if such should become necessary 
in addition  in the event a borrower defaults on the loan during its construction phase  the construction project often needs to be completed before the full value of the collateral can be realized by the company 
commercial business loans the company s commercial loan portfolio consists of loans to businesses for equipment purchases  working capital term loans and lines of credit  debt refinancing  small business administration sba loans  and domestic standby letters of credit 
typically  these loans are secured by general business security agreements  real estate  and personal guarantees 
the company offers variable  adjustable  and fixed rate loans 
approximately of the company s commercial business loans have an interest rate that adjusts daily or monthly with an interest rate floor  with the majority based on the prevailing prime rate plus a margin 
the company also has commercial business loans that have an initial period where interest rates are fixed  generally one to five years  and thereafter are adjustable based on various indexes 
fixed rate loans are priced at either a margin over the yield on us treasury issues with maturities that correspond to the maturities of the notes or to match competitive conditions and yield requirements 
term loans are generally amortized over a three to seven year period and line of credit commercial business loans generally have a term of one year and  in the case of small lines of credit  up to five years 
all borrowers having an exposure to the company of  or more are reviewed annually  unless it is an investment real estate loan at which point the annual review occurs for loans over million 
the largest commercial business loan at december   was to a leasing company located in the milwaukee area and had an outstanding balance of million 
this loan was secured by equipment and an assignment of leases

asset quality one of the company s key operating objectives has been and continues to be the maintenance of a high level of asset quality 
through a variety of strategies  including but not limited to  early intervention  borrower workout arrangements  and aggressive marketing of foreclosed properties and repossessed assets  the company has been proactive in addressing problem and non performing assets 
these strategies  as well as continued emphasis on quality loan underwriting  maintenance of sound credit standards for new loan originations  and annual evaluation of large credits have generally resulted in delinquency and non performing asset ratios below the national norm  although there can be no assurances that this will continue 
delinquent loans and foreclosed assets when a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan  the company takes a number of steps to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
in the case of one to four family mortgage loans  the company s loan servicing department is responsible for collection procedures from the th day of delinquency through the completion of foreclosure 
specific procedures include a late charge notice being sent at the time a payment is over days past due with a second notice in the form of a billing coupon being sent before the payment becomes days past due 
once the account is days past due  the company attempts telephone contact with the borrower 
letters are sent if contact has not been established by the th day of delinquency 
on the th day of delinquency  attempts at telephone contact continue and stronger letters  including foreclosure notices  are sent 
if telephone contact cannot be made  the company sends either a qualified third party inspector or a loan officer to the property in an effort to contact the borrower 
when contact is made with the borrower  the company attempts to obtain full payment or work out a repayment schedule to avoid foreclosure 
all properties are inspected prior to foreclosure approval 
most borrowers pay before the agreed upon payment deadline and it is not necessary to start a foreclosure action 
foreclosure action generally starts when the loan is between the th and th day of delinquency following review by a senior officer 
in conjunction with commencing a foreclosure action  the company evaluates the borrower and collateral to determine any potential loss 
if there is a potential loss  a specific loan loss allowance is developed or an 
table of contents appropriate charge off is taken to bring the loan balance in line with the value of the liquidated real estate 
loan charge offs are reported to the board of directors 
if the loan is deemed to be uncollectible  the company seeks the shortest redemption period possible thus waiving its right to collect any deficiency from the borrower 
if the company obtains the property at the foreclosure sale  it holds the property as real estate owned  which is a component of other assets on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
the company obtains a market evaluation of the property to determine that its carrying balance is consistent with the market value of the property 
marketing of the property begins immediately following the company taking title to the property 
the marketing is usually undertaken by a realtor knowledgeable with the particular market 
mortgage insurance claims are filed if the loan had mortgage insurance coverage 
it is marketed after a market evaluation is obtained and any mortgage insurance claims are filed 
the collection procedures and guidelines as outlined by fannie mae  freddie mac  state va  wheda  and guaranteed rural housing are followed by the company 
management personnel review delinquent consumer loans on a regular basis 
the collection procedures for consumer loans  excluding student loans  indirect consumer loans and credit card loans  include sending periodic late notices to a borrower once a loan is to days past due depending upon the grace period associated with a loan 
the company attempts to make direct contact with a borrower once a loan becomes days past due 
if collection activity is unsuccessful  the company may pursue legal remedies itself  refer the matter to legal counsel for further collection effort  or charge off the loan 
loans the company deems to be uncollectible  or partially uncollectible  are charged off or a specific loan loss allowance is established so that the carrying balance approximates the value of the collateral 
a charge off of consumer loans requires the approval of a senior officer and is reported to the board of directors 
all student loans are serviced by a third party  which guarantees its servicing to comply with all us department of education guidelines 
the company s student loan portfolio is guaranteed under programs sponsored by the us government 
credit card loans are serviced by a third party administrator and indirect consumer loans are serviced by savings financial corporation sfc  a owned subsidiary of the bank 
the collection procedures for multi family  commercial real estate  and commercial business loans include sending periodic late notices to a borrower once a loan is past due 
the company attempts to make direct contact with a borrower once a loan becomes days past due 
the company s managers of the multi family and commercial real estate loan areas review loans days or more delinquent on a regular basis 
if collection activity is unsuccessful  the company may refer the matter to legal counsel for further collection effort 
after days  loans that are delinquent are typically proposed for repossession or foreclosure  a specific reserve may be allocated to that loan  or partial or full charge offs are taken to bring the loan balance in line with the expected collectibility of the loans 
legal action requires the approval of the company s board of directors  and charge offs are reported to the board 
the company s policies require that management continuously monitor the status of the loan portfolio and report to the board of directors on a monthly basis 
these reports include information on delinquent loans and foreclosed real estate 

table of contents the following table presents information regarding non accrual mortgage  consumer loans  commercial business loans  accruing loans delinquent days or more  and foreclosed properties and repossessed assets as of the dates indicated

the company recorded a million loss provision related to this loan in  but continues to work with the developer to dispose of the condominium units 
management is uncertain at this time whether the company will ultimately foreclose on the project and or whether additional losses may be recorded in the future as a result of further deterioration in the value of the condominium units 
also contributing to the increase in non performing loans in was a general deterioration in economic conditions which resulted in a million increase in non performing one to four family mortgage loans  as well as increases in non performing consumer and commercial business loans 
management believes non performing loans and assets  expressed as a percentage of total loans and assets  compare favorably with national averages for financial institutions  due in part to the company s conservative loan underwriting standards 
in addition  management believes real estate values in wisconsin have not been as negatively impacted as certain other regions of the united states 
with the exception of mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by the state va  guaranteed rural housing  and student loans  the company generally stops accruing income on loans when interest or principal payments are greater than days in arrears or earlier when the timely collectibility of such interest or principal is doubtful 
the company designates loans on which it stops accruing income as non accrual loans and generally  it establishes a reserve for outstanding interest that was previously credited to income 
the company may recognize income in the period that it collects such income when the ultimate collectibility of principal is no longer in doubt 
the company returns a non accrual loan to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist 
all commercial business and commercial real estate loans which are greater than days past due are considered to be potentially impaired 
in addition  the company may declare a loan impaired prior to a loan being days past due  if it determines there is a question as to the collectibility of principal 
impaired loans are individually assessed to determine whether a loan s carrying value is in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loan s cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate and if the carrying value is in excess  a loan loss allowance will be established 
loans considered to be impaired as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  at december   totaled million as compared to million at december   million at december   million at december   and million at december  the average of impaired loans for the year ended december   was million and the interest received and recognized on these loans was  
table of contents foreclosed real estate  which is included in other assets on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition  consists of property the company acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
foreclosed properties increased in as compared to primarily as a result of a general deterioration in economic conditions which resulted in increased home foreclosure activity 
contributing to a lesser extent were foreclosures related to certain small commercial real estate loans 
foreclosed real estate properties are initially recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value 
thereafter  the company carries foreclosed real estate at fair value less estimated selling costs typically about 
foreclosed real estate is inspected periodically 
additional outside appraisals are obtained as deemed necessary 
additional write downs may occur if the property value deteriorates further after it is acquired 
these additional write downs are charged to the company s results of operations as they occur 
charge offs the company will typically charge off a loan at foreclosure  repossession  or liquidation and or when the loan is otherwise deemed uncollectible 
the amount of the charge off will depend on the fair market value of the underlying collateral and may be zero if the fair market value exceeds the loan amount 
all charge offs are recorded as a reduction to allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses the following table presents the activity in the company s allowance for loan losses at or for the periods indicated

the company is responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required 
management of the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses  as well as estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio for which certain losses are probable  but not specifically identifiable 
loan loss allowances are reviewed monthly 
general allowances are maintained by the following categories for performing loans to provide for unidentified inherent losses in the portfolios one to four family residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  multi family and commercial real estate loans  and commercial business loans 
various factors are taken into consideration in establishing the loan loss allowance including historical loss experience  loan to value ratio and or collateral coverage ratio  economic factors  and other factors  that  in management s judgment would affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are charged against operations as provision for loan losses 
the appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed by senior management based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company 
other outside factors such as 
table of contents credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  and recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectibility of the loan  are also considered by management 
although the company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at an amount that reflects management s best estimate of the amount necessary to provide for probable and estimable losses on loans  future additions may be necessary if economic and other conditions in the future differ substantially from the current operating environment and as the loan portfolio grows and its composition changes 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios and the related allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate 
one or more of these agencies  specifically the ots  may require the company to increase the allowance for loan losses or the valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination  thereby adversely affecting the company s results of operations

mortgage related securities mortgage related securities consist principally of mortgage backed securities mbss  real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
most of the company s mortgage related securities are directly or indirectly insured or guaranteed by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae  freddie mac or fannie mae 
the remaining securities are investment grade  private label cmos 
private label cmos generally carry higher credit risks and higher yields than mortgage related securities insured or guaranteed by agencies of the us government 
for additional discussion related to the company s private label cmos  refer to part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
mortgage related securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees or credit enhancements that reduce credit risk 
however  mortgage related securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans 
in general  mortgage related securities issued or guaranteed by ginnie mae  freddie mac and fannie mae are weighted at no more than for risk based capital purposes  compared to the risk weighting assigned to most non securitized residential mortgage loans 
while these securities carry a reduced credit risk as compared to private label cmos  they remain subject to the risk of a fluctuating interest rate environment and instability in related markets 
along with other factors  such as the geographic distribution of the underlying mortgage loans  changes in interest rates may alter the prepayment rate of those mortgage loans and affect the value of mortgage related securities

table of contents regulation and supervision general the company is a wisconsin corporation registered with the office of thrift supervision ots as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
the bank is a federally chartered savings bank 
the company files reports with the ots and is subject to regulation and examination by the ots  the bank is also subject to these requirements as well as those of the fdic 
the company also is required to file certain reports with  and otherwise comply with  the rules and regulations of the sec under the federal securities laws 
any change in these laws and regulations  whether by the ots  the fdic  the sec  or through legislation  could have a material adverse impact on the company  the bank  and the company s shareholders 
certain of the laws and regulations applicable to the company and the bank are summarized below 
these summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such laws and regulations 
as a consequence of the instability of financial markets and financial institutions in the united states and globally and the deepening world wide recession  congress has recently passed legislation  and regulatory authorities have adopted regulations  which have a substantial effect upon financial holding companies and institutions including the company and the bank 
the company discusses certain significant new legislation and regulations which affect the company or the bank in the following paragraphs 
however  even in the case of the legislation or regulations which have already been adopted  the consequences and effects  both short term and long term  on the company and the bank cannot yet be known  and further related regulations and interpretations may have additional effects 
in addition  in  the federal government announced a financial stability plan which would further affect financial holding companies and institutions such as the company and the bank 
among other things  the financial stability plan establishes a capital assistance program cap under which financial institutions undergo comprehensive stress tests to evaluate their capital needs and determine if they can absorb losses and continue lending if economic conditions were to be more adverse than generally expected 
banks that have undergone the stress test will have access to treasury funds to restore or maintain their capital bases 
in exchange for the cap funds  the treasury will receive preferred securities convertible to common equity 
eligibility requirements for participation in the cap are generally the same as those for a qualified financial institution under the cpp 
the stability plan also focuses on increased transparency and accountability of institutions receiving funds 
participating institutions will also be subject to greater sec disclosure requirements and other restrictions  including restrictions related to dividends  stock repurchases  acquisitions and executive compensation 
the deadline for applying to participate in the cap is may  management does not currently believe that the company is in need of an additional capital buffer that would warrant participation in the cap 
however  management continues to evaluate the cap and other new programs to determine if participation would provide a material benefit to the company 
the financial stability plan is subject to further definition and changes prior to its adoption and or implementation 
in addition  it is widely expected that there will be additional potential legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry 
the effect of the financial stability plan and other potential legislation and regulation on the company and the bank cannot yet be determined 
regulation and supervision of the bank general as a federally chartered  fdic insured savings bank  the bank is subject to extensive regulation by the ots and the fdic 
lending activities and other investments must comply with federal statutory and regulatory requirements 
this federal regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic and depositors rather than the shareholders of the company 
this regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies regarding the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves 
the ots regularly examines the bank and issues a report on its examination findings to the bank s board of directors 
the bank s relationships with its depositors and borrowers are also regulated by federal law  especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of the bank s loan documents 

table of contents the bank must file reports with the ots and the fdic concerning its activities and financial condition  and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into transactions such as mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions 
regulatory capital requirements ots capital regulations require savings associations such as the bank to meet three capital standards 
the minimum standards are tangible capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  core capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  and risk based capital equal to at least of total risk weighted assets 
these capital standards are in addition to the capital standards promulgated by the ots under its prompt corrective action regulations 
tangible capital is defined as core capital less all intangible assets  certain mortgage servicing rights  and certain non includable subsidiaries 
core capital is defined as common shareholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  related surplus and minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  non withdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual savings associations  and qualifying supervisory goodwill  less non qualifying intangible assets  mortgage servicing rights  and investments in certain non includable subsidiaries 
the risk based capital standard for savings institutions requires the maintenance of total risk based capital of at least of risk weighted assets 
risk based capital is comprised of core and supplementary capital 
the components of supplementary capital include  among other items  cumulative perpetual preferred stock  perpetual subordinated debt  mandatory convertible subordinated debt  intermediate term preferred stock  up to of unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values  and the portion of the allowance for loan losses not designated for specific loan losses 
the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses includable in supplementary capital is limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
overall  supplementary capital is limited to of core capital 
a savings association must calculate its risk weighted assets by multiplying each asset and off balance sheet item by various risk factors as determined by the ots  which range from for cash to for delinquent loans  property acquired through foreclosure  commercial loans  and other assets 
ots rules require a deduction from capital for institutions that have unacceptable levels of interest rate risk 
the ots calculates the sensitivity of an institution s net portfolio value based on data submitted by the institution in a schedule to its quarterly thrift financial report and using the interest rate risk measurement model adopted by the ots 
the amount of the interest rate risk component  if any  is deducted from an institution s total capital in order to determine if it meets its risk based capital requirement 
prompt corrective action the fdic has established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured institutions 
the ots  as well as the other federal banking regulators  adopted the fdic s regulations governing the supervisory actions that may be taken against undercapitalized institutions 
these regulations establish and define five capital categories  in the absence of a specific capital directive  as follows total capital to risk tier capital to risk tier capital to category weighted assets weighted assets total assets well capitalized adequately capitalized under capitalized significantly undercapitalized critically undercapitalized if the bank receives the highest rating under the uniform system 
if the bank receives the highest rating under the uniform system 
tangible assets to capital of if equal to or less than 
the severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank s capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories 
all savings associations are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if  following such distribution  the association would be undercapitalized 
the fdic or the ots in the case of the bank  is required to monitor closely the condition of an undercapitalized bank and to restrict the growth of its assets 
an undercapitalized savings association is required to file a capital restoration plan within days of the date the association receives notice that it is within any of the three undercapitalized categories  and the plan must be 
table of contents guaranteed by any parent holding company 
the aggregate liability of a parent holding company is limited to the lesser of an amount equal to of the bank s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the bank into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such bank as of the time it fails to comply with the plan 
if a savings association fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
banks that are significantly or critically undercapitalized are subject to a wider range of regulatory requirements and restrictions 
the fdic has a broad range of grounds under which it may appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured savings association 
if one or more grounds exist for appointing a conservator or receiver for a savings association  the fdic may require the association to issue additional debt or stock  sell assets  be acquired by a depository bank or savings association holding company or combine with another depository savings association 
the fdic is also required to appoint a receiver or a conservator for a critically undercapitalized savings association within days after the association becomes critically undercapitalized or to take such other action that would better achieve the purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions 
such alternative action can be renewed for successive day periods 
however  if the savings association continues to be critically undercapitalized on average during the quarter that begins days after it first became critically undercapitalized  a receiver must be appointed  unless the fdic makes certain findings that the association is viable 
dividend and other capital distribution limitations the ots imposes various restrictions or requirements on the ability of savings associations to make capital distributions  including dividend payments 
ots regulations require the bank to give the ots days advance notice of any proposed declaration of dividends  and the ots has the authority under its supervisory powers to prohibit the payment of dividends 
ots regulations impose uniform limitations on the ability of all savings banks and associations to engage in various distributions of capital such as dividends to the company  stock repurchases  and cash out mergers 
in addition  the regulation utilizes a three tiered approach permitting various levels of distributions based primarily upon a savings bank s capital level 
the bank currently meets the criteria to be designated a tier association and  consequently  could at its option after prior notice to  and no objection made by  the ots distribute to the company up to of its net income during the calendar year plus its retained net income for the preceding two years  less any distributions previously paid during the year 
additional dividends or distributions would require further ots approval 
the ots has substantial discretion in deciding whether or not to approve such dividends  and may use its discretion  in view of the current state of the financial markets  to cut back on its approval of dividends 
while the bank has received prior approval for dividends up to of net income  there can be no assurances that the ots will continue to provide approval at that  or any other  level

insurance on deposits may be terminated by the fdic if it finds that the bank has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or the ots as the bank s primary regulator 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition  or violation that might lead to termination of the bank s deposit insurance 
the fdic sets deposit insurance premiums based upon the risks a particular bank or savings association posed to its deposit insurance funds 
under the risk based deposit insurance assessment system  the fdic assigns an institution to one of three capital categorizations based on the institution s financial information  as of the reporting period ending six months before the assessment period 
the three capital categorizations are well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized 
the fdic also assigns an institution to one of three supervisory sub categorizations within each capital group 
with respect to the capital ratios  institutions are classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized using ratios that are substantially similar to the prompt corrective action capital ratios discussed above 
the fdic also assigns an institution to a supervisory subgroup based on a supervisory evaluation provided to the fdic by the institution s primary federal regulator and information that the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds which may include  if applicable  information provided by the institution s state supervisor 
an institution s assessment rate depends on the capital categorizations and supervisory categorizations to which it is assigned 
under the risk based assessment system  there are then four assessment risk categories to which different assessment rates are applied 
assessment rates for deposit insurance currently range from five basis points to basis points 
the capital and supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned by the fdic is confidential and may not be disclosed 
any increase in insurance assessments could have an adverse effect on the earnings of insured institutions  including the bank 
pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of fdira  the fdic was granted broader authority in adjusting insurance premium rates and more flexibility in establishing the designated reserve ratio 
fdira provided assessment credits to insured depository institutions that could be used to offset certain insurance assessments 
in and the bank was able to offset a substantial portion of its assessment as a result of these credits 
the bank s credits expire after the first quarter of  which will result in higher costs related to deposit insurance assessments in 
table of contents during the fourth quarter of the fdic announced a substantial increase in deposit insurance premiums for all financial institutions in  the fdic has established new assessment rates which are higher than rates that will be subject to further adjustment  effective april  in addition  in february  the fdic announced a special assessment of insured institutions to bolster the fdic s reserves 
as a result of the increase and the special assessment  as well as certain premium credits that expire in  management estimates that the company s deposit insurance premiums will increase to approximately million in compared to  in  although there can be no assurances 
furthermore  deposit insurance premiums in could be higher than the amount currently estimated by management depending on the outcome of another fdic proposal to substantially alter the way in which it differentiates for risk in its current risk based assessment system 
the fdic has also reserved the right to make additional special assessments  beyond the one already approved  if necessary or appropriate 
management is unable to estimate the probability or amount of any additional assessment at this time 
as previously noted  during the fourth quarter of the fdic announced the creation of the tlgp 
one component of this program was the transaction account guarantee program tagp  which provides for full deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts  regardless of dollar amount  until december  the bank elected to participate in this program  which is not expected to have a material impact on the deposit premiums the bank would otherwise expect to pay in transactions with affiliates sections a and b of the federal reserve act govern transactions between an insured federal savings association  such as the bank  and any of its affiliates  such as the company 
the federal reserve board has adopted regulation w  which comprehensively implements and interprets sections a and b  in part by codifying prior federal reserve board interpretations under sections a and b 
an affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or a financial subsidiary under the glb act is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for the purposes of sections a and b  however  the ots has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of a savings association as affiliates on a case by case basis 
sections a and b limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such bank s capital stock and surplus  and limit all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus

among other things  the cra regulations contain an evaluation system that would rate an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs 
in particular  the evaluation system focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of making community development investments  and a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  atms and other offices 
the cra requires the ots  in the case of the bank  to provide a written evaluation of a savings association s cra performance utilizing a four tiered descriptive rating system and requires public disclosure of an association s cra rating 
the bank received a satisfactory overall rating in its most recent cra examination 
safety and soundness standards each federal banking agency  including the ots  has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines

table of contents regulation and supervision of the company holding company regulation the company is registered with the ots as a unitary savings and loan holding company and therefore  is subject to regulation and supervision by the ots 
the ots has enforcement authority over the company and its non savings institution subsidiaries 
among other things  this authority permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to the bank and to monitor and regulate the company s capital and other activities such as dividends and share repurchases that can affect capital 
the company is limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies because it is not a grandfathered unitary holding company 
a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature  including underwriting equity securities and insurance  incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity 
federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company  directly or indirectly  from acquiring control of another savings institution or holding company thereof  without prior written approval of the ots

sarbanes oxley act the sarbanes oxley act of was adopted in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with the accounting and corporate governance scandals at several prominent companies 
the stated goals of the sarbanes oxley act are to increase corporate responsibility  to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws 
the sarbanes oxley act applies to all public companies  including the company  that file periodic reports with the sec 
the sarbanes oxley act includes additional disclosure requirements  corporate governance rules  requirements for the sec and national securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure  corporate governance and other related rules  and increases penalties for violation 
the sarbanes oxley act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and to state corporate law and corporate governance  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management  between a board of directors and its committees  and the corporation and its shareholders 
because some ots accounting and governance regulations also refer to the sec s regulations  the sarbanes oxley act also affects the bank 
acquisition of bank mutual corporation under federal law  no person may acquire control of the company or the bank without first obtaining the approval of such acquisition of control by the ots 
under the federal change in bank control act and the savings and loan holding company act  any person  including a company  or group acting in concert  seeking to acquire or more of the outstanding shares of the company must file a notice with the ots

federal and state taxation federal taxation the company and its subsidiaries file a calendar year consolidated federal income tax return  reporting income and expenses using the accrual method of accounting 
the federal income tax returns for the company s subsidiaries have been examined and audited or closed without audit by the internal revenue service for tax years through  although the company is currently undergoing an exam of its tax year

refer to part i  item a  risk factors  for additional discussion related to this development 

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the discussion and analysis set forth in part i  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the cautionary statements set forth in part i  item  business  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the company s results of operations  financial condition  and outlook 
the interest rate environment may have an adverse impact on the company s net interest income from june through june the federal reserve federal open market committee fomc increased the federal funds target rate times from to 
beginning in september  it decreased the federal funds target rate eleven times from to a range of to 
a volatile interest rate environment makes it difficult for the company to coordinate the timing and amount of changes in the rates of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings with the rates of interest it earns on loans and securities 
in addition  volatile interest rate environments cause corresponding volatility in the demand by individuals and businesses for the loan and deposit products offered by the company 
this volatility has a direct impact on the company s net interest income  and consequently  its net income 
management expects future interest rates to continue to be volatile and is unable to predict the impact such volatility will have on the net interest income and profits of the company 
changes in market interest rates or other conditions may have an adverse impact on the fair value of the company s available for sale securities  shareholders equity  and profits gaap requires the company to carry its securities at fair value on its balance sheet 
unrealized gains or losses on these securities  reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost  net of its tax effect  are reported as a component of shareholders equity 
when market rates of interest increase  the fair value of the company s securities available for sale generally decreases and equity correspondingly decreases 
when rates decrease  fair value generally increases and shareholders equity correspondingly increases 
however  due to significant disruptions in global financial markets during  this usual relationship was disrupted 
despite a declining interest rate environment during  certain of the company s available for sale securities declined in value  its private label cmos in particular 
in addition  recent and future legislation and or instability in related markets could affect the value of the company s private label cmos 
in the company s unrealized losses on its portfolio of securities available for sale increased significantly 
management expects continued volatility in the fair value of its securities available for sale and is not able to predict when or if the fair value of such securities will improve 
in certain instances gaap requires recognition through earnings of declines in the fair value of securities that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired otti 
in the company recognized million in otti losses on two mutual funds 
in the fair value of one of these funds declined by an additional million and was deemed to be otti 
management believes it is possible there could be continued volatility in the fair value of this mutual fund  which could have an adverse impact on the company s future net income 
changes in the financial condition or future prospects of the fhlb of chicago may have an adverse impact on the company s investment in fhlb common stock the company is a voluntary member of the fhlb of chicago  and holds shares in the fhlb of chicago as a condition of borrowing money from it 
in  the fhlb of chicago was required to suspend payment of dividends on its stock 
if there are any further developments that impair the value of the common stock of the fhlb of chicago  the company would be required to write down the value of the shares which it holds  which in turn could affect the company s net income and shareholder s equity 
if the company s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  the company s earnings could decrease the company s loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
a continued slowdown in the economy may affect borrowers ability to repay their loan obligations which could lead to increased loan 
table of contents losses or provisions 
as a result  the company may experience significant loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results 
softness in the real estate market may adversely affect collateral values and the company s profits the company s market areas have generally experienced a decline in real estate values and an increase in non residential tenant vacancies 
these developments could affect the value of the collateral securing the company s mortgage loans 
that decrease in value could in turn lead to increased losses on loans in the event of foreclosures 
increased losses would affect the company s loan loss allowance and may cause it to increase its provision for loan losses resulting in a charge to earnings 
some of the company s lending activities are in credits that are riskier than one to four family real estate loans the company has identified commercial real estate  commercial business  construction and development  and consumer loans as areas for lending emphasis 
while lending diversification is being pursued for the purpose of increasing net interest income  non residential and construction and development loans historically have carried greater risk of payment default than residential real estate loans 
as the volume of these loans increases  credit risk increases 
in the event of substantial borrower defaults  the company s provision for loan losses would increase and loans may be written off  and therefore  earnings would be reduced 
wisconsin tax developments could reduce the company s net income like many wisconsin financial institutions  the company has non wisconsin subsidiaries which hold and manage investment assets and loans  the income on which has not been subject to wisconsin tax 
the wisconsin department of revenue the department has instituted an audit program specifically aimed at out of state subsidiaries of wisconsin banks 
the department has asserted the position that some or all of the income of the out of state subsidiaries is taxable in wisconsin 
the department is conducting audits of many wisconsin banks  its audit of the bank has not yet been concluded  is not being actively pursued  and the department has not asserted a claim against the bank or its subsidiaries 
the department sent letters in to wisconsin financial institutions whether or not they were undergoing an audit reporting on settlements the department had reached with certain other financial institutions and their out of state investment subsidiaries 
the letter provided a summary of available settlement parameters 
for prior periods they included restrictions on the types of subsidiary income excluded from wisconsin taxation  assessment of certain back taxes relating to a limited time period  limitations on net operating loss carry forwards  and interest on past due taxes but no penalties 
for and going forward  the letter states similar provisions  including limits on subsidiaries assets  which could be considered in determining income not subject to wisconsin taxation 
as outlined  the settlement would result in the rescission of prior department letter rulings and purport to be binding going forward except for future legislation or change by mutual agreement 
however  the letter appears to implicitly accept the general proposition that some out of state investment subsidiary income is not subject to wisconsin taxes 
the department s positions may be challenged by one or more financial institutions in the state 
the company has previously engaged in discussions with the department and has asked the department to consider some specific factors which the company believes may distinguish it from many other institutions 
however  the change in wisconsin tax law described below causes the settlement agreements between the department and other banks to be inapplicable on a going forward basis 
it is not yet known whether the department will continue to challenge the bank s treatment of its out of state investment subsidiaries for prior years  and  if so  whether the department will continue to offer the same  if any  settlement terms 
depending upon the terms and circumstances  an adverse resolution of these matters could result in additional wisconsin tax obligations for prior periods  which could have a substantial negative impact on the earnings of the company 
the company currently has wisconsin tax years open since under extensions with the department in connection with the audit 
the company believes it has reported income and paid wisconsin taxes in accordance with applicable legal requirements  and the department s long standing interpretations thereof  and that the company would likely prevail against the department should it attempt to tax the income of the company s out of state subsidiaries in wisconsin 
however  management can provide no assurances of this result 
the company also may incur further costs in the future to address these issues 

table of contents as previously mentioned  wisconsin law was recently amended  effective january   to significantly restrict the future tax benefits of out of state investment subsidiaries through enactment of combined reporting legislation 
going forward  this change in tax law is expected to have a substantial negative impact on the earnings of the company 
if the company had been required to file a combined wisconsin income tax return in  management estimates the company s income tax expense would have been approximately million higher than reported in that year  excluding the impact of state net operating loss carryforwards  if any  that may be available to the company 
the global credit market crisis and deteriorating economic conditions may significantly affect the company s liquidity  financial condition  and earnings global financial markets recently have been  and continue to be  extremely unstable and unpredictable  and economic conditions have been weak and appear to be deteriorating 
continued  and potentially increased  volatility  instability and weakness could affect the company s ability to sell investment securities and other financial assets  which in turn could adversely affect the company s liquidity and financial position 
this instability also could affect the prices at which the company could make any such sales  which could adversely affect its earnings and financial condition 
conditions could also negatively affect the company s ability to secure funds or raise capital for acquisitions and other projects  which in turn  could cause the company to use deposits or other funding sources for such projects 
in addition  the instability of the markets and weakness of the economy could affect the strength of the company s customers or counterparties  their willingness to do business  and or their ability to fulfill their obligations  which could further affect the company s earnings 
current conditions  including increasing unemployment  deteriorating corporate performance  the continued softening of real estate markets and the decline of home sales and property values  could negatively affect the volume of loan originations and prepayments  the value of the real estate securing the company s mortgage loans  and borrowers ability to repay loan obligations  all of which could adversely impact the company s earnings and financial condition 
recent and future legislation and rulemaking in response to market and economic conditions may significantly affect the company s results of operations and financial condition the instability and volatility in the credit markets led to the adoption of significant legislation and regulatory actions in the past few months which will significantly affect financial institutions and holding companies  including the company 
this legislation includes the recently adopted federal stimulus legislation  and the federal government s proposed financial stability plan  which could substantially affect the company and the bank in far reaching ways which cannot yet be determined 
during the  the federal government enacted the emergency economic stabilization act of  the us department of the treasury has  among other things  established the troubled assets relief program tarp  including a voluntary capital purchase program 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the fdic announced the creation of the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp in which it temporarily guarantees newly issued senior unsecured debt of participating organizations and providing full coverage for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts 
in and  the fdic has also adopted  and proposed substantial further  increases to its insurance premiums payable by financial institutions  including a special assessment to bolster the fdic s reserves 
further  the federal government announced a financial stability plan  which among other things  establishes a capital assistance program cap under which financial institutions undergo comprehensive stress tests to evaluate their capital needs and determine if they can absorb losses and continue lending if economic conditions were to be more adverse than generally expected  subject to the results of these tests  institutions may have access to treasury funds to augment their capital 
the financial stability plan is subject to further definition and changes prior to its adoption and or implementation 
although the company elected to not participate in the tarp capital purchase program and elected to not participate in the debt guarantee component of the tlgp  and does not currently expect to participate in cap although it continues to evaluate the possibility of doing so  management believes these new laws  regulations  and changes may significantly affect the business environment  the markets for and value of the company s securities  and its ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
in addition  it is widely expected that there will be additional potential legislation and regulations affecting the financial services industry 
at this time  management cannot fully determine the extent of these effects  as well as any future laws and regulations that may be enacted as a result of the current economic crisis 

table of contents the current economic turmoil has also increased the potential for federal or state governments to legislate foreclosure forbearance  forced loan modifications  or cram downs of losses to lenders in bankruptcy proceedings 
such efforts could lead to increased loan charge offs or loan loss provisions and or reduced income 
these efforts could also have an adverse impact on the value of certain mortgage related securities not guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae  and ginnie mae  such as private label cmos 
strong competition within the company s market area may affect net income the company encounters strong competition both in attracting deposits and originating real estate and other loans 
the company competes with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
the company s market area includes branches of several commercial banks that are substantially larger than the company in terms of deposits and loans 
for example  approximately half of the deposits in the milwaukee market area are held by two large commercial banks 
in addition  tax exempt credit unions operate in most of the company s market area and aggressively price their products and services to a large part of the population 
if competitors succeed in attracting business from the company s customers  its deposits and loans could be reduced  which would likely affect earnings 
the company s ability to grow may be limited if it cannot make acquisitions the company will continue to seek to expand its banking franchise by opening new offices  growing internally  and acquiring other financial institutions or branches and other financial services providers 
the company s ability to grow through selective acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches will depend on successfully identifying  acquiring  and integrating those institution or branches 
the company has not made any acquisitions in recent years  as management has not identified acquisitions for which it was able to reach an agreement on terms management believed were appropriate and or which met its acquisition criteria
