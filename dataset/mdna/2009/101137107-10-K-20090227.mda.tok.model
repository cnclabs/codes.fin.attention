item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in item of this annual report 
introduction boston scientific corporation is a worldwide developer  manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties 
our business strategy is to lead global markets for less invasive medical devices by developing and delivering products and therapies that address unmet patient needs  provide superior clinical outcomes and demonstrate compelling economic value 
we intend to achieve leadership  drive profitable sales growth and increase shareholder value by focusing on customers innovation quality people financial strength in the first quarter of  we completed the divestiture of certain non strategic businesses 
our operating results for the years ended december  and include a full year of results of these businesses 
our operating results for the year ended december  include the results of these businesses through the date of separation 
we are involved in several post closing separation activities through transition service agreements  some from which we continue to generate net sales 
these transition service agreements expire throughout and the first half of refer to the strategic initiatives section and note f divestitures and assets held for sale to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for a description of these business divestitures 
on april   we consummated the acquisition of guidant corporation 
with this acquisition  we became a major provider in the cardiac rhythm management crm market  enhancing our overall competitive position and long term growth potential  and further diversifying our product portfolio 
we also now share certain drug eluting stent technology with abbott laboratories  which gives us access to a second drug eluting stent program  and complements our taxus stent system program 
see note d acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for further details on the guidant acquisition and abbott transaction 
our operating results for the years ended december  and include a full year of results of our crm business that we acquired from guidant 
our operating results for the year ended december  include the results of the crm business beginning on the date of acquisition 
we have included supplemental pro forma financial information in note d acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report which gives effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred at the beginning of executive summary financial highlights and trends net sales in were billion  which included sales from divested businesses of million  as compared to net sales of billion in  which included sales from divested business of million  a decrease of million or four percent 
foreign currency fluctuations increased our net sales by million in  as compared to excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses  our net sales were flat with the prior year 
worldwide net sales of our crm products increased eight percent in  including an eight percent increase in our us crm net sales and a seven percent increase in international crm product net sales 
these increases were driven by multiple product launches in both our us and international markets  highlighted by the launch of our cognis cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator crt d system and our teligen implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd system 
in addition  net sales from our endosurgery businesses grew eight percent and our neuromodulation division increased net sales by twenty percent in  as compared to partially offsetting these increases  was a decline in worldwide net sales from our cardiovascular division of four percent during  due principally to the impact of new competition in the us drug eluting stent market 
however  we realized increased us drug eluting stent market share in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the third quarter of  and exited the year with an estimated percent share of the us drug eluting stent market for the month of december 
our reported net loss for was billion  or per share  on approximately billion weighted average shares outstanding  as compared to a net loss for of million  or per share  also on billion weighted average shares outstanding 
our reported results for included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and acquisition  divestiture  litigation and restructuring related net charges  and discrete tax items of billion after tax  or per share  consisting of billion billion pre tax of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  associated primarily with a write down of goodwill  a million gain million pre tax related to the receipt of an acquisition related milestone payment from abbott  million million pre tax of net purchased research and development charges  associated primarily with the acquisitions of labcoat  ltd 
and cryocor  inc  million of costs million pre tax associated with our on going expense and head count reduction initiatives  a million gain million pre tax  associated with the sale of certain non strategic businesses  million of net losses million pre tax in connection with the sale of certain non strategic investments  million of litigation related charges million pre tax resulting primarily from a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by johnson johnson  and million of discrete tax benefits related to certain tax positions associated with prior period acquisition  divestiture  litigation and restructuring related charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our acquisition of guidant 
the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization during the fourth quarter created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance  therefore  we performed an interim impairment test 
key factors contributing to the impairment charge included disruptions in the credit and equity markets  and the resulting impacts to weighted average costs of capital  and changes in crm market demand relative to our original assumptions at the time of acquisition 
refer to note e goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information 
our reported results for included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and acquisition  divestiture  litigation and restructuring related charges of billion after tax  or per share 
refer to liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of these charges 
we continued to generate substantial cash flow during cash provided by operating activities was billion in as compared to million in at december   we had total debt of billion  cash and cash equivalents of billion and working capital of billion 
during  we prepaid billion of debt under our term loan and our credit facility secured by our us trade receivables and  in february  prepaid an additional million 
as a result  our next scheduled debt maturity is million due in april strategic initiatives in  we announced several new initiatives designed to enhance short and long term shareholder value  including the restructuring of several of our businesses and product franchises  the sale of non strategic businesses and investments  and significant expense and head count reductions 
our goal was  and continues to be  to better align expenses with revenues  while preserving our ability to make needed investments in quality  research and development r d  capital improvements and our people that are essential to our long term success 
these initiatives have helped to provide better focus on our core businesses and priorities  which we believe will strengthen boston scientific for the future and position us for increased  sustainable and profitable sales growth 
the execution of this plan enabled us to reduce r d and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately million exiting restructuring in october  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  an expense and head count reduction plan  which resulted in the elimination of approximately  positions worldwide 
we initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of and expect to be substantially complete worldwide in refer to results of operations and note h restructuring related activities to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for information on restructuring related activities and estimated costs 
plant network optimization on january   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plant network optimization plan  which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines from one facility to another and by closing certain facilities 
the plan is a complement to our previously announced expense and head count reduction plan  and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins 
activities under the plan will be initiated in and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of refer to results of operations and note h restructuring related activities to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for information on restructuring related activities and estimated costs 
divestitures during  we determined that our auditory  vascular surgery  cardiac surgery  venous access and fluid management businesses were no longer strategic to our on going operations 
therefore  we initiated the process of selling these businesses in  and completed their sale in the first quarter of  as discussed below 
we received pre tax proceeds of approximately billion from the sale of these businesses and our trivascular endovascular aortic repair evar program  and eliminated  positions in connection with these divestitures 
in january  we completed the sale of a controlling interest in our auditory business and drug pump development program  acquired with advanced bionics corporation in  to entities affiliated with the principal former shareholders of advanced bionics for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
in connection with the sale  we recorded a loss of million pre tax in  attributable primarily to the write down of goodwill 
in addition  we recorded a tax benefit of million during in connection with the closing of the transaction 
also in january  we completed the sale of our cardiac surgery and vascular surgery businesses for net cash proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with the sale  we recorded a pre tax loss of million in  representing primarily a write down of goodwill 
in addition  we recorded a tax expense of million during in connection with the closing of the transaction 
in february  we completed the sale of our fluid management and venous access businesses for net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million million after tax during associated with this transaction 
further  in march  we sold our evar program obtained in connection with our acquisition of trivascular  inc for million in cash 
we discontinued our evar program in in connection with the sale  we recorded a pre tax gain of million million after tax during during  in connection with our strategic initiatives  we announced our intent to sell the majority of our investment portfolio in order to monetize those investments determined to be non strategic 
in june  as part of our initiative to monetize non strategic investments  we signed separate definitive agreements with saints capital and paul capital partners to sell the majority of our investments in  and notes receivable from  certain publicly traded and privately held entities for gross proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with these agreements  we received proceeds of million during in addition  we received million of proceeds from other transactions to monetize certain other non strategic investments and notes receivable 
we recorded net pre tax losses of approximately million during related to these monetization initiatives and the write down of certain non strategic investments 
we expect to receive million of remaining proceeds from the saints and paul transactions during  and do not expect to record significant gains or losses in related to these definitive agreements 
refer to our other  net discussion  as well as note g investments and notes receivable to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for more information on our investment portfolio activity 
corporate warning letter in january  legacy boston scientific received a corporate warning letter from the us food and drug administration fda notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three site specific warning letters issued to us in was inadequate 
we have identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the fda and have made significant progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions 
during  the fda reinspected a number of our facilities and  in october  informed us that our quality system is now in substantial compliance with its quality system regulations 
the fda has approved all of our requests for final approval of class iii product submissions previously on hold due to the corporate warning letter and has approved all currently eligible requests for certificates to foreign governments cfgs 
since october  we have received approval to market the following new products in the us our taxus express atom paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system  designed for treating small coronary vessels  our taxus libert paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system  our second generation drug eluting stent system  our carotid wallstent monorail endoprosthesis  a less invasive alternative to surgery for treating carotid artery disease  our apex percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca dilatation catheter  for treating the most challenging atherosclerotic lesions  our express sd renal monorail stent system  the first low profile  pre mounted stent approved in the us for use in renal arteries  and our sterling monorail and over the wire balloon dilatation catheter for use in the renal and lower extremity arteries 
the fda also approved the use of our taxus express paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system for the treatment of in stent restenosis isr in bare metal stents  the first isr approval granted by the fda 
the corporate warning letter remains in place pending final remediation of certain medical device report mdr filing issues  which we are actively working with the fda to resolve 
this remediation has resulted and may continue to result in incremental medical device and vigilance reporting  which could adversely impact physician perception of our products 
in stent restenosis is re narrowing of the vessel inside a stent 
business and market overview cardiac rhythm management we estimate that the worldwide crm market approximated billion in  as compared to approximately billion in  and estimate that us icd system sales represented approximately percent of the worldwide crm market in both years 
worldwide crm market growth rates over the past three years  including the us icd market  have been below those experienced in prior years  resulting primarily from previous industry field actions and from a lack of new indications for use 
in  however  we began to see renewed growth of the worldwide crm market with steadily increasing implant volumes 
net sales of our crm products represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales for and percent in the following are the components of our worldwide crm product sales in millions year ended december  year ended december  us international total us international total icd systems pacemaker systems our us sales of crm products in increased million  or eight percent  as compared to our us sales benefited from growth in the us crm market and from the successful launch of our next generation cognis crt d and teligen icd systems  as well as the launches of our confient icd system  the livian crt d system  and the altrua family of pacemaker systems 
we experienced ten percent growth in us crm sales during each of the second  third and fourth quarters of  largely as a result of these new product launches 
our international crm product sales increased million  or seven percent in  as compared to  due primarily to an increase in the size of the international icd market 
however  our net sales and market share in japan have been negatively impacted as we move to a direct sales model for our crm products in japan and  until we fully implement this model  our net sales and market share in japan may continue to be negatively impacted 
during  we received more than a dozen new crm product approvals 
we will continue to execute on our product pipeline and expect to begin offering our latitude patient management system in certain european countries in this technology  which enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients are in their homes  is a key component of many of our implantable device systems 
we also plan to launch our next generation pacemaker  the ingenio pacemaker system  in the us  our emea europe middle east africa region and certain inter continental countries in the first half of we believe that these launches position us for sustainable growth within the worldwide crm market 
net sales from our crm products represent a significant source of our overall net sales 
therefore  increases or decreases in net sales from our crm products could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
while we believe that the size of the crm market will increase above existing levels  there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of this increase 
we believe we are well positioned within the crm market  however  the following variables may impact the size of the crm market and or our share of that market our continued ability to improve the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community  the referring physician community and prospective patients in our technology  future product field actions or new physician advisories by us or our competitors  our ability to successfully launch next generation products and technology  the successful conclusion and positive outcomes of on going clinical trials that may provide opportunities to expand indications for use  variations in clinical results  reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies  our ability to retain key members of our sales force and other key personnel  new competitive launches  and average selling prices and the overall number of procedures performed 
coronary stents the size of the coronary stent market is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary intervention pci procedures performed  as well as the percentage of those that are actually stented  the number of devices used per procedure  average drug eluting stent selling prices  and the drug eluting stent penetration rate a measure of the mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents used across procedures 
we estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated billion in and  and estimate that drug eluting stents represented approximately percent of the dollar value of worldwide coronary stent market sales in both years 
uncertainty regarding the efficacy of drug eluting stents  as well as the increased perceived risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents  contributed to a decline in the worldwide drug eluting stent market size during and however  data addressing this risk and supporting the safety of drug eluting stent systems positively affected trends in the growth of the drug eluting stent market in  as referring cardiologists regained confidence in this technology 
net sales of our coronary stent systems represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales for and percent in we are the only company in the industry to offer a two drug platform strategy with our taxus paclitaxel eluting stent system and the promus everolimus eluting stent system 
the following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales in millions year ended december  year ended december  us international total us international total taxus promus drug eluting bare metal during  us sales of our drug eluting stent systems declined million  or percent  due primarily to an increase in competition following recent competitive launches 
we believe that our average share of the late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot  or thrombus  within the stented area one year or more after implantation of the stent 
us drug eluting stent market declined to percent during  as compared to percent in in addition  pricing pressure resulted in a reduction in the average selling price of our taxus stent system in the us by approximately five percent as compared to the prior year 
however  increasing penetration rates have had a positive effect on the size of the us drug eluting stent market 
average drug eluting stent penetration rates in the us were percent during exiting at percent for the month of december  as compared to percent during exiting at percent for the month of december 
we believe this is a strong indicator that the recovery of the us drug eluting stent market is continuing and the market is strengthening 
in addition  the launch of our taxus express atom and taxus libert stent systems in the us during the fourth quarter of had a positive effect on our market share 
we believe that exiting  we were the market leader with percent share of the us drug eluting stent market for the month of december  and are well positioned entering our international drug eluting stent system sales increased million  or two percent  in as compared to  due to a full year of drug eluting stent sales in japan and growth in the size of the international drug eluting stent market as a result of increased pci procedural volume and higher penetration rates 
in may of  we launched our taxus express coronary stent system in japan  and  in january  we received approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare to market our second generation taxus libert drug eluting stent system in japan 
we are planning to launch our taxus libert stent system in japan during the first quarter of and the promus everolimus eluting coronary stent system in the second half of  subject to regulatory approval 
in july  abbott launched its xience v everolimus eluting coronary stent system  and  simultaneously  we launched the promus everolimus eluting coronary stent system  supplied to us by abbott 
as of the closing of abbott s acquisition of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses  we obtained a perpetual license to use the intellectual property used in guidant s drug eluting stent system program purchased by abbott 
we believe that being the only company to offer two distinct drug eluting stent platforms provides us a considerable advantage in the drug eluting stent market and has enabled us to sustain our worldwide leadership position 
however  under the terms of our supply arrangement with abbott  the gross profit and operating profit margin of a promus stent system is significantly lower than that of our taxus stent system 
our promus stent systems have operating profit margins that approximate half of our taxus stent system operating profit margin 
therefore  if sales of our promus stent system continue to increase in relation to our total drug eluting stent system sales  our profit margins will continue to decrease 
refer to our gross profit discussion for more information on the impact this sales mix has had on our gross profit margins 
further  the price we pay abbott for our supply of promus stent systems is determined by our contracts with them 
our cost is based  in part  on previously fixed estimates of abbott s manufacturing costs for promus stent systems and third party reports of our average selling price of promus stent systems 
amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are subject to a retroactive adjustment at pre determined intervals based on abbott s actual costs to manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of promus stent systems 
during  we may make a payment to or receive a payment from abbott based on the differences between their actual manufacturing costs and the contractually stipulated manufacturing costs and differences between our actual average selling price and third party reports of our average selling price  in each case  with respect to our purchases of promus stent systems from abbott during  and as a result  during  our profit margins on the promus stent system may increase or decrease 
we are reliant on abbott for our supply of promus stent systems 
any production or capacity issues that affect abbott s manufacturing capabilities or the process for forecasting  ordering and receiving shipments may impact our ability to increase or decrease the level of supply to us in a timely manner  therefore  our supply of promus stent systems may not align with customer demand  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
at present  we believe that our supply of promus stent systems from abbott is sufficient to meet customer demand 
further  our supply agreement with abbott for promus stent systems extends through the middle of the fourth quarter of in europe  and is currently being reviewed by the european commission for possible extension  and through the end of the second quarter of in the us and japan 
we are incurring incremental costs and expending incremental resources in order to develop and commercialize an internally developed and manufactured next generation everolimus eluting stent system 
we expect that this stent system  the promus element stent system  will have gross profit margins more comparable to our taxus stent system and will improve our overall gross profit and operating profit margins once launched 
we expect to launch promus element in our emea region and certain inter continental countries in late and in the us and japan in mid we expect to launch our first generation promus everolimus eluting coronary stent system during the second half of in japan 
our product pipeline also includes the taxus element coronary stent system 
we expect to launch our taxus element stent system in emea and certain inter continental countries during the fourth quarter of and in the us and japan in mid historically  the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs  patient populations and trial end points 
unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us  by our competitors or by third parties  or the market s perception of these clinical data  may adversely impact our position in  and share of the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market 
we believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market for a variety of reasons  including our two drug eluting stent platform strategy  the broad and consistent long term results of our taxus clinical trials  and the favorable results of the xience v promus stent system clinical trials to date  the performance benefits of our current and future technology  the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products  our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force  and the strength of our clinical  marketing and manufacturing capabilities 
however  a further decline in net sales from our drug eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting stent market and our position within this market include our ability to successfully launch next generation products and technology features  physician and patient confidence in our technology and attitudes toward drug eluting stents  including the continued abatement of prior concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis  changes in drug eluting stent penetration rates  the overall number of pci procedures performed  average number of stents used per procedure  and average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems  the outcome of intellectual property litigation  variations in clinical results or perceived product performance of our or our competitors products  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies  our ability to retain key members of our sales force and other key personnel  and changes in fda clinical trial data and post market surveillance requirements and the associated impact on new product launch schedules and the cost of product approvals and compliance 
there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market 
we are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with certain of our existing competitors  including johnson johnson  and other independent patent holders 
there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more proceedings would not materially impact our ability to meet our objectives in the coronary stent market  and our liquidity and results of operations 
we previously had several active lawsuits pending between us and medtronic  inc however  on january   we reached an agreement to stop all litigation between us and medtronic with respect to interventional cardiology and endovascular repair cases 
see note l commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a description of these legal proceedings 
other businesses interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems in addition to coronary stent systems  our interventional cardiology business markets balloon catheters  rotational atherectomy systems  guide wires  guide catheters  embolic protection devices  and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca procedures  and ultrasound and imaging systems 
our net sales of these products increased to billion in  as compared to million in  an increase of million or four percent 
this increase was driven primarily by growth in our ultrasound and imaging system franchise  including increased sales of our ilab ultrasound imaging system  which enhances the diagnosis and treatment of blocked vessels and heart disorders 
in addition  in november  the fda approved our apex ptca dilatation catheter  used in treating atherosclerotic lesions 
peripheral interventions our peripheral interventions business product offerings include stents  balloon catheters  sheaths  wires and vena cava filters  which are used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease 
our net sales of these products decreased slightly to million in  as compared to million in the decrease was a result of us sales declines of million in to million  from million in  primarily as a result of increased competition across most of the vascular interventional product categories 
our international peripheral interventions business grew million in  as compared to  due primarily to foreign currency fluctuations 
we continue to hold a strong worldwide position in the peripheral interventions market and we are the market leader in multiple product categories 
further  in the fourth quarter of  we received fda approval for three new products our carotid wallstent monorail endoprosthesis for the treatment of patients with carotid artery disease who are at high risk for surgery  our express sd renal monorail premounted stent system for use as an adjunct to percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty in certain lesions of the renal arteries  and our sterling monorail and over the wire balloon dilatation catheter for use in the renal and lower extremity arteries 
neurovascular we market a broad line of products used in treating diseases of the neurovascular system 
our neurovascular net sales increased to million in  as compared to million in  an increase of million or two percent 
our us net sales were million in  as compared to million in  and our international net sales were million in  as compared to million in we plan to launch a next generation family of detachable coils  including an enhanced delivery system with reduced coil detachment times  in the us in the second half of within our product pipeline  we are also developing next generation technologies for the treatment of aneurysms  intracranial atherosclerotic disease and acute ischemic stroke  and are involved in numerous clinical activities that are designed to expand the size of the worldwide neurovascular market 
endosurgery our endosurgery group develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions  including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems within our endoscopy division  and urological and gynecological disorders within our urology division 
our endosurgery group net sales grew eight percent in to billion  and accounted for percent of our total net sales in  as compared to percent in the following are the components of our worldwide endosurgery business in millions year ended december  year ended december  us international total us international total endoscopy urology our endoscopy net sales grew nine percent in to million from million in key sales growth drivers within endoscopy included our biliary franchise  which grew million  or percent  to million on the strength of our spyglass direct visualization system for single operator duodenoscope assisted cholangiopancreatoscopy  or visual examination of the bile ducts  which was launched in the second quarter of in addition  our hemostasis franchise grew million  or percent  to million on the strength of our resolution clip device  which is the only currently marketed mechanical clip designed to open and close up to five times before deployment to enable a physician to see the effects of the clip before committing to deployment 
our urology net sales grew seven percent in to million from million in this growth was primarily due to our pelvic floor franchise  which grew percent  or million  to million  led by our line of sling based devices and kits  which are used in the treatment of a variety of stress and age related disorders of the lower female anatomy 
the remaining urology growth was spread across the other components of our business  including our stone management and gynecology franchises 
during  we intend to launch a number of new products across multiple franchises in both our endoscopy and urology businesses 
neuromodulation despite new product launches during the year by both of our major competitors  our neuromodulation net sales increased to million in  as compared to million in  an increase of million or percent 
our us net sales were million in  as compared to million in  and our international net sales were million in  as compared to million in we continued to maintain our strong position within the us market with our precision spinal cord stimulation scs system  used for the treatment of chronic pain of the lower back and legs 
we believe that we continue to have a technology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as multiple independent current control  which allows the physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely 
in addition  we are currently assessing the use of our scs system to treat other sources of pain 
these factors  coupled with the move of our neuromodulation business to a new state of the art facility during  position us well for continued growth in this market 
innovation our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances 
our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions 
we expect to continue to invest in our crm and drug eluting stent technologies  and will also invest selectively in areas outside of these markets 
we expect to continue to invest in our paclitaxel drug eluting stent program  along with our internally developed and manufactured everolimus eluting stent program the promus element stent system  to sustain our leadership position in the worldwide drug eluting stent market 
there can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility  obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance 
a delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth 
our strategic acquisitions are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers safe  effective  high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs 
management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses 
however  our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions 
potential future acquisitions may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing  depending on their size and nature 
we have entered strategic alliances with both publicly traded and privately held companies 
we enter these alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
during  we monetized certain investments and alliances no longer determined to be strategic see the strategic initiatives section for more information 
while we believe our remaining strategic investments are within attractive markets with an outlook for sustained growth  the full benefit of these alliances is highly dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology and ability to execute 
an inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings  or litigation related to these technologies  among other factors  may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these strategic alliances 
reimbursement and funding our products are purchased principally by hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers worldwide that typically bill various third party payors  such as governmental programs eg  medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients 
third party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria 
reimbursement by third party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs  clinical outcomes and economic value 
these reimbursement methodologies confer different  and sometimes conflicting  levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients  and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements 
third party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third party payors  that reimbursement will be available or  if available  that the third party payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
accordingly  the outcome of these reimbursement decisions could have an adverse impact on our business 
in addition  the current economic climate may impose further pressure on funds available for reimbursement of healthcare and on reimbursement levels 
manufacturing and raw materials we design and manufacture the majority of our products in technology centers around the world 
many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off the shelf items available from multiple supply sources 
certain items are custom made to meet our specifications 
we believe that in most cases  redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time 
we also have an on going program to identify single source components and to develop alternative back up supplies 
however  in certain cases  we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific components or materials  largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers 
a reduction or interruption in supply  an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required  or a significant increase in the price of raw materials or components could adversely affect our operations and financial condition  particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drug eluting stent systems 
in addition  our products require sterilization prior to sale and we rely primarily on third party vendors to perform this service 
to the extent our third party sterilizers are unable to process our products  whether due to raw material  capacity  regulatory or other constraints  we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner  which could have an adverse impact on our operations 
international markets our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions  currency fluctuations  regulatory and reimbursement approvals  competitive offerings  infrastructure development  rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy 
any significant changes in the competitive  political  regulatory  reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
international markets  including japan  are affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs 
initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  are under way in many countries in which we do business 
implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as japan  europe and other international markets may limit the price of  or the level at which reimbursement is provided for  our products and may influence a physician s selection of products used to treat patients 
we expect these practices to put increased pressure on reimbursement rates in these markets 
in addition  most international jurisdictions have adopted regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices  and we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions 
further  some emerging markets rely on the fda s cfgs in lieu of their own regulatory approval requirements

our us net sales  excluding sales from divested businesses  increased million  or two percent  in  as compared to the increase related primarily to an increase in us crm product sales of approximately million due to a full year of consolidated operations in in addition  we achieved year over year us sales growth of approximately million in our endosurgery businesses and million in our neuromodulation business 
offsetting these increases was a decline in our us cardiovascular division sales of approximately million  driven primarily by lower sales of our taxus drug eluting stent system as a result of a decrease in the size of the us drug eluting stent market 
this decrease was driven principally by declines in drug eluting stent penetration rates resulting from on going concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of drug eluting stents

the shift in sales away from taxus stent systems during was primarily due to increased sales of promus stent systems in the us  following its july approval and launch 
under the terms of our supply arrangement with abbott  the gross profit margin of a promus stent system is significantly lower than that of our taxus stent system 
in  sales of our promus stent system represented percent of our worldwide drug eluting stent system sales  as compared to two percent in our gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory charges and other period expenses during both years 
in  these charges consisted primarily of a million inventory write off related to an fda warning letter received by one of our third party sterilizers  and approximately million of crm related inventory write offs  resulting principally from the successful launch of cognis and teligen 
in  these charges included warranty related and other scrap charges

refer to note d acquisitions and note i borrowings and credit arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information on the abbott transaction and our debt obligations 
our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with the required covenants 
our inability to maintain these covenants could require us to seek to further renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants  both of which could result in additional borrowing costs 
see note i borrowings and credit arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information regarding these covenants 
equity during  we received million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  as compared to million in and million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during  or approximately million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments  which is in addition to our outstanding principal debt obligations as presented in the previous table  and is based on conditions in existence as of december  see note d acquisitions and note i borrowings and credit arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information regarding our acquisition and debt obligations 
payments due by period in millions thereafter total lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty obligations unrecognized tax benefits interest payments in accordance with us gaap  these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations relate primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business 
interest payment amounts related to our term loan are projected using market interest rates as of december  future interest payments may differ from these projections based on changes in the market interest rates 
the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of billion  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note k income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits 
certain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration 
see note d acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our recent acquisitions 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  performance milestones will be reached  or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues  the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above 
additionally  we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the commitments with cash  including cash obtained through the sale of our stock 
payments due to the former shareholders of advanced bionics in connection with our amended merger agreement are accrued as of december   and therefore  do not appear in the table above 
certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies  we have not included these future potential payments in the table above 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december   which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers compensation programs 
the increase is due primarily to a million letter of credit entered into in in order to secure a damage award pending appeal related to the johnson johnson patent infringement case 
as of december   none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees 
we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and intend to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies 
we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
we describe these accounting polices in note a significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas requiring management s judgment that we consider critical revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from the sale of single use medical devices 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment  unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional services 
we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage  or implant  which indicates that the sale is complete 
for our other transactions  we recognize revenue when our products are delivered and risk of loss transfers to the customer  provided there are no substantive remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance  and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns 
for multiple element arrangements where the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations  as with our latitude patient management system  we defer revenue on the undelivered element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value  and recognize the associated revenue over the related service period 
we present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 
we generally allow our customers to return defective  damaged and  in certain cases  expired products for credit 
we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product 
in addition  we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings  for these transactions  we defer recognition of revenue based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next generation products are shipped to the customer 
we offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers 
we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current 
we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates 
if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably  we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered 
we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices 
we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above 
inventory provisions we base our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory 
valuation of business combinations we record intangible assets acquired in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations  including identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill 
we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations  purchased research and development charges  and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods 
purchased research and development our purchased research and development represents the value of acquired in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region 
through december   we have expensed the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accounting standards effective through that date 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisition as a whole 
in addition  we record certain costs associated with our alliances as purchased research and development 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions  we used the following ranges of risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows percent in  percent in  and percent to percent in we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
impairment of intangible assets we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
conditions that may indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset  a product recall  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
for purposes of the recoverability test  we group our intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group  we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 
in addition  we review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets 
to test for impairment  we calculate the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  the carrying value is written down to the fair value 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group 
the use of alternative assumptions  including estimated cash flows  discount rates  and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment 
see note a significant accounting policies and note e goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for more information related to impairment of intangible assets during  and goodwill impairment we test our goodwill balances as of april during the second quarter of each year for impairment 
we test our goodwill balances more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we have identified our domestic divisions  which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment  and our two international operating segments as our reporting units for purposes of the goodwill impairment test 
to derive the carrying value of our reporting units at the time of acquisition  we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination 
in addition  for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test  assets and liabilities  including corporate assets  which relate to a reporting unit s operations  and would be considered in determining fair value  are allocated to the individual reporting units 
we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit  but from which the reporting unit benefits  based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated  we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate 
we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods  once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our acquisition of guidant 
the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization during the fourth quarter created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance  therefore  we performed an interim impairment test 
key factors contributing to the impairment charge included disruptions in the credit and equity market  and the resulting impacts to weighted average cost of capital  and changes in crm market demand relative to our original assumptions at the time of acquisition

investments in publicly traded and privately held entities we account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary 
we account for investments in entities over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method 
our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity requires judgment 
we consider the guidance in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for investments in limited liability companies  and eitf topic d  accounting for limited partnership investments  in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity 
we regularly review our investments for impairment indicators 
if we determine that impairment exists and it is other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment s carrying value and its fair value 
see note a significant accounting policies and note g investments and notes receivable to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a detailed analysis of our investments and our accounting treatment for our investment portfolio 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we recognized net deferred tax liabilities of billion at december  and billion at december  the liabilities relate primarily to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions 
the assets relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves  litigation and product liability reserves  purchased research and development  investment write downs  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
in light of our historical financial performance  we believe we will recover substantially all of these assets 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
we consider relevant evidence  both positive and negative  to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 
we do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are billion at december  and billion at december  we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination 
see note k income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a detailed analysis of our income tax accounting 
legal  product liability costs and securities claims we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings  including intellectual property  breach of contract  securities litigation and product liability suits 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products 
we are substantially self insured with respect to product liability claims 
we maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims 
we generally record losses for claims in excess of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue anticipated costs of settlement  damages  losses for general product liability claims and  under certain conditions  costs of defense  based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable 
otherwise  we expense these costs as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was billion at december  and million at december   and includes estimated costs of settlement  damages and defense 
the increase in our accrual is due primarily to a pre tax charge of million resulting from a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by johnson johnson  which we recorded during the third quarter of partially offsetting this increase was a reduction of million as a result of payments made in the fourth quarter of related to the guidant multi district litigation mdl settlement described in note l commitments and contingencies 
in the first quarter of  we made an additional mdl payment of approximately million  and anticipate making the remaining payments of million during the first half of these amounts were both accrued as of december  we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and  therefore  additional losses may be accrued in the future  which could adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and our ability to comply with our debt covenants

our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop  manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies 
we do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures 
furthermore  we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions 
our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments  forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries 
we use both nonderivative primarily european manufacturing operations and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates
