overview we continued to experience increased demand for our services in  resulting in a increase in revenue over under our contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states  we processed million transactions  a growth of over in addition  we continued to see increased demand from enterprises that require systems capable of handling high volumes of internet traffic  which fueled demand for domain name systems service offerings  especially our ultra services 
our results in were significantly impacted by two goodwill impairment charges totaling million and a long lived assets impairment charge of million  all of which related to our ngm business segment 
in the fourth quarter of  in response to lower than anticipated adoption rates of our ngm services and the resulting underperformance of our ngm business  as well as the manner in which the mobile data market had evolved and was evolving  we added new leadership and changed the strategic direction of our ngm business 
associated with this decision  we began to realign the ngm organization in december of  and we began development of a new technology platform that would serve as the common infrastructure for each of our ngm customers 
though we believe the implementation of this new strategy for the ngm business will position it well for long term success  this repositioning of our ngm business will result in a delay in market penetration and delayed growth in end user adoption rates 
in  our cash flow from operating activities was million  which demonstrates our ability to generate strong cash flows notwithstanding deteriorating market conditions  particularly in the second half of the year 
the strength of our business and financial condition enabled us to use million in cash to repurchase shares of our common stock during the year and still end the year with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
recent developments on january   we amended our contracts to provide telephone number portability and other clearinghouse services to telecommunications service providers in the united states 
the pricing terms under the amended contracts are based on a fixed fee model rather than a transaction based model 
specifically  the amended contracts establish an annual base fee for the telephone number portability services we provide  which base fee is subject to an annual price escalator of 
the amended contracts also provide for fixed credits in  and that are used to calculate the respective annual fixed fee 
in addition  our customers may earn additional credits annually in  and if certain levels of aggregate telephone number inventories are reached and if certain ip fields and functionality are adopted and implemented 
in the event that transactions in a given year are above or below the established volume range for that year  the base fee may be adjusted up or down  respectively  with any such adjustment being applied to the following year s invoices

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection 
table of contents and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected 
see item a of this report  risk factors  for certain matters that may bear on our future results of operations

significant contracts we provide wireline and wireless number portability  implement the allocation of pooled blocks of telephone numbers and provide network management services pursuant to seven contracts with north american portability management llc  an industry group that represents all telecommunications service providers in the united states 
we recognize revenue under our contracts with north american portability management llc primarily on a per transaction basis 
the aggregate fees for transactions processed under these contracts are determined by the total number of transactions  and these fees are billed to telecommunications service providers based on their allocable share of the total transaction charges 
this allocable share is based on each respective telecommunications service provider s share of the aggregate end user services revenue of all us telecommunications service providers  as determined by the fcc 
under our contracts  we also bill a revenue recovery collections  or rrc  fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers  which is available to us if any telecommunications service provider fails to pay its allocable share of total transactions charges 
if the rrc fee is insufficient for that purpose  these contracts also provide for the recovery of such differences from the remaining telecommunications service providers 
the per transaction pricing under these contracts provided for annual volume based credits that were earned on all transactions in excess of the pre determined annual volume threshold 
for  the maximum aggregate volume based credit was million  which was applied via a reduction in per transaction pricing once the pre determined annual volume threshold was surpassed 
when the aggregate credit was fully satisfied  the per transaction pricing was restored to the prevailing contractual rate 
in the pre determined annual transaction volume threshold under the contract was exceeded  which resulted in the issuance of million of volume based credits for no volume based credits were applied in and as a result of amendments to our contracts with north american portability management llc in september in  pricing under our contracts with north american portability management llc was per transaction regardless of transaction volume 
beginning january   per transaction pricing was derived on a straight line basis using an effective rate calculation formula based on annualized transaction volume between million and million 
for annualized transaction volumes less than or equal to million  the per transaction price is equal to a flat rate of per transaction 
for annualized volumes greater than or equal to million  the per transaction price is equal to a flat rate of per transaction 
for the year ended december   the weighted average per transaction price was 

table of contents service level standards pursuant to certain of our private commercial contracts  we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
we record a provision for these performance related penalties when we become aware that required service levels that would trigger such a penalty have not been met  which results in a corresponding reduction of our revenue 
for more information regarding how we recognize revenue for each of our service categories  please see the discussion above under revenue recognition 
restructuring in december  we announced a restructuring plan for our ngm business segment  involving the termination of certain employees  and reduction in or closure of leased facilities in some of our international locations 
as a result  we incurred million in severance related costs and million in lease and facilities exit costs for the year ended december  these restructuring costs include estimated costs for net lease expense for facilities that are no longer being used 
the provision is equal to the present value of the minimum future lease payments under our contractual lease obligations  offset by the present value of the estimated sublease payments that we may receive 
as of december   our accrued restructuring liability was million  including million and million of liabilities relating to our clearinghouse and ngm segments  respectively 
the total minimum lease payments for restructured facilities are million  net of anticipated sublease payments 
these lease payments will be made over the remaining lives of the relevant leases  which range from six months to four years 
if actual market conditions are different than those we have projected  we will be required to recognize additional restructuring costs or benefits associated with these facilities 
goodwill we have made numerous acquisitions  including the acquisitions of ultradns corporation and followap inc  resulting in our recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  as well as other definite lived intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would reduce the fair value of such assets below their carrying amount 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would indicate the possibility of impairment 
for purposes of our annual impairment test  we have identified and assigned goodwill to two reporting units  our clearinghouse reporting unit and our ngm reporting unit 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets  including assigned goodwill  to the book value of its net assets  including assigned goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using both an income approach and market approach 
to assist in the process of determining whether a goodwill impairment exists  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available  and we may obtain appraisals from external advisors 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its net book value  the assigned goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the fair value is less than the reporting unit s net book value  we perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
if required  the second step involves a comparison of the book value of the reporting unit s assigned goodwill to the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  using a theoretical purchase price allocation based on this implied fair value  in order to determine the magnitude of the impairment 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
the annual goodwill impairment test  any required interim goodwill impairment test and the related determination of the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets each involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions by management  and are inherently subjective 
in particular  for each of our reporting units  the significant assumptions used to determine fair value include market penetration  anticipated growth rates  and risk adjusted discount rates for the income approach  as well as the selection of comparable companies and comparable transactions for the market approach 
changes in estimates and assumptions could have 
table of contents a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
moreover  for our ngm reporting unit  due to the early stage of its operations and the emerging nature of mobile instant messaging technology  the assumptions and estimates used by management that are incorporated within the ngm reporting unit valuation have a high degree of subjectivity  and are thus more likely to change over time 
in addition  because relatively few carriers control a substantial portion of the end users who will drive the success of mobile instant messaging  the activities of ngm s largest customers can have a significant impact on these assumptions and estimates 
the impact of a change in assumptions in the context of our goodwill impairment testing may be material 
for example  in  changes to our key assumptions in determining the fair value of our ngm reporting unit resulted in two goodwill impairment charges 
specifically  late in the first quarter of  there were changes in the market and identified customer related events that caused us to change certain of our assumptions underlying the financial forecast relating to ngm  most notably our assumptions about end user adoption rates 
projections of future cash flows for the ngm business are particularly sensitive to these assumptions 
as a result  when the events of the first quarter caused us to reduce our projections relating to the rate at which new end users would begin using mobile instant messaging  those changed assumptions had a dramatic impact on our financial forecast for that business and the estimated fair value of our ngm business 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment charge in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
in the fourth quarter of  in response to lower than anticipated adoption rates and the resulting underperformance of our ngm business  as well as the manner in which the mobile data market had evolved and was evolving  we added new leadership and conducted a strategic evaluation of our ngm business 
the goal of this strategic evaluation was to position ngm for future long term success in the mobile instant messaging market 
during the course of this evaluation  we conducted a thorough review of the ngm business  including our experience in the mobile instant messaging market since our acquisition of followap inc in november  the current state of the mobile instant messaging market and related markets  the performance of our competitors for these services and consumer demand 
following this evaluation  we decided to change the direction of our ngm business to offer enhanced end user experiences  faster deployments  and greater operator control  all of which would be delivered from a common infrastructure 
associated with this decision  we began to realign the ngm organization  and we announced a restructuring plan in december to leverage our existing operational resources to support our ngm initiatives 
in addition  consistent with our new strategic direction  we began development of a new technology platform that would serve as the common infrastructure for each of our ngm customers 
this repositioning of our ngm business will result in a delay in market penetration and delayed growth in end user adoption rates 
at the same time  the ngm business will require continued investment and we will continue to experience net cash outflows until that market penetration and growth occurs 
the revisions to the financial forecast to reflect this new strategic direction resulted in a decline in the estimated fair value of the ngm business 
as a result  we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of the key assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test to determine the fair value of the ngm reporting unit included a cash flow projections  which include growth assumptions for forcasted revenue and expenses  b a terminal multiple of times based upon the expected proceeds resulting from a sale of the ngm business unit at the end of the cash flow projection period  c a discount rate of  which was based upon the ngm business unit s weighted cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations at the time of the annual goodwill impairment test  d selection of comparable companies and transactions used in the market approach  and e our assumptions in weighting the results of the discounted cash flow approach  income approach and market approach valuation techniques 
a variance in these assumptions could have a significant effect on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded 
the fair value of our ngm reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying value as of the annual impairment date 
as a result  we performed a step two analysis to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of our ngm reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of our ngm reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of our ngm reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we considered the fair value of our assets and 
table of contents liabilities  including technology assets and customer relationships  and the appropriate treatment of deferred tax balances 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable  however  these estimates are inherently subjective  and there are a number of factors  including factors outside of the our control  that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates 
for example  with respect to our ngm business  our assumptions could change due to further delays resulting from changes in strategy by participants in the mobile instant messaging market  lack of effective marketing efforts to promote mobile instant messaging to end users  unforeseen changes in the market or otherwise 
any changes to our key assumptions about our businesses and our prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an additional impairment charge 
such a charge could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements because of the significance of goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had million and million  respectively  in goodwill for our clearinghouse reporting unit and our ngm reporting unit  subject to future impairment tests 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
 we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
recoverability measurement and estimation of undiscounted cash flows is done at the lowest possible level for which there is an identifiable asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
management must exercise judgment in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of the long lived assets 
factors that could indicate that impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to a plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price or in the value of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
during the fourth quarter of  we made the determination that our strategic decision to reposition the ngm business and the resulting change in our projected results served as an indicator of impairment for long lived assets in our ngm business reporting unit 
we performed a recoverability test  determined that the fair value of these long lived assets was less than the carrying value  and recorded an million charge for impairment of long lived assets  the largest component of which consisted of technology and customer relationships 
in determining fair value  we utilized valuation models that involved assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and  as appropriate  review of market comparables 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of our long lived assets are reasonable  however  there are a number of factors  including factors outside of the our control  that could cause actual results to differ from our assumptions and estimates 
moreover  assumptions and estimates used by management that are incorporated within the valuation of ngm s long lived assets have a higher degree of subjectivity and are more likely to change over time 
as a result of the strategic repositioning of our ngm business and the resulting change in our financial forecast  all of which is described above under the heading critical accounting policies goodwill  we recorded an impairment of long lived assets specific to our ngm reporting unit of million during the fourth quarter of as of december   we had million and million  respectively  in long lived assets for our clearinghouse reporting unit and our ngm reporting unit 
accounts receivable  revenue recovery collections  and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
in accordance with our contracts with north american portability management llc  we bill a rrc fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers 
the aggregate rrc fees collected may be used to offset uncollectible receivables from an 
table of contents individual customer 
beginning july   the rrc fee was of monthly billings 
on july   the rrc fee was reduced to 
any accrued rrc fees in excess of uncollectible receivables are paid back to the customers annually on a pro rata basis 
all other receivables related to services not covered by the rrc fees are evaluated and  if deemed not collectible  are appropriately reserved 
investments we have approximately million par value in investments related to auction rate securities  or ars  all of which are classified as noncurrent at december  for each of our ars at december   we determined the fair value using discounted cash flow and market comparables methods 
the discounted cash flow valuation method involves management s judgment and assumptions regarding discount rates  coupon rates  and estimated maturity for each of the ars 
the market comparables valuation method involves management s judgment regarding the selection of comparable securities and transactions in a secondary market 
based on the results of our assessments  we recorded losses of million for the year ended december  to reduce the value of our ars 
if we use different assumptions and judgments in our valuations or the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of our ars through additional charges in current period earnings 
as of december   our ars investment balance subject to future fluctuations in fair value is approximately million 
in november  we accepted a settlement offer in the form of a rights offering from the investment firm that brokered the original purchases of the million par value of ars  which provides us with the right to sell these securities at par value to the investment firm during a period beginning on june  because the settlement agreement is a legally enforceable firm commitment  the rights are recognized as a financial asset at fair value in our financial statements at december   and accounted for separately from the associated securities 
we have elected to measure the rights at their fair value pursuant to sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas  and subsequent changes in fair value will also be recognized in current period earnings 
because we intend to exercise the rights in june  we do not have the intent to hold the associated auction rate securities until recovery or maturity 
we have classified the ars as trading securities pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  or sfas no 
 which requires changes in the fair value of these securities to be recorded in current period earnings  which we believe will substantially offset changes in the fair value of the rights 
we determined the fair value of the rights using a discounted cash flow method which involves judgment and assumptions regarding the timing of cash flows  fair value of the underlying ars and the ability of the investment firm to disburse the cash anticipated in the ars rights offering 
based upon our assessment of the fair value of the rights  we recorded a gain of approximately million for the year ended december  in interest and other income in our statement of operations 
we have approximately million par value in investments related to a cash reserve fund which is closed to new investments and subject to immediate redemptions 
the fund currently has a projected schedule that will result in approximately to percent of the fund to be redeemed in because there is little or no market data  the fair value of the securities within the cash reserve fund was determined using pricing models that utilize recent trades for securities in active markets and dealer quotes for securities considered to be inactive  as well as contractual terms  maturity and assumptions about liquidity 
as of december   our cash reserve fund balance subject to future fluctuations in fair value was approximately million 
for the year ended december   we recorded other than temporary losses of million related to these securities held at december  income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets  including valuation allowances  and liabilities requires us 
table of contents to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws and our future operations 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
income tax provision includes us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
the provision or benefit for income taxes is based upon our estimate of our annual effective income tax rate 
in determining the estimated annual effective income tax rate  we analyze various factors  including projections of our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated  the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and was adopted by us on january  fin provides a two step approach to recognize and measure tax benefits when the benefits realization is uncertain 
the first step is to determine whether the benefit is to be recognized  the second step is to determine the amount to be recognized 
income tax benefits should be recognized when  based on the technical merits of a tax position  the entity believes that if a dispute arose with the taxing authority and were taken to a court of last resort  it is more likely than not ie  a probability of greater than percent that the tax position would be sustained as filed 
if a position is determined to be more likely than not of being sustained  the reporting enterprise should recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin upon adoption is to be reported as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
our practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
the internal revenue service  or irs  has initiated an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years and we anticipate that the examination will be completed within the next twelve months 
while the outcome of the audit is uncertain  we do not currently believe that the outcome will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  or sfas no 
r  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share based awards based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires that we make several estimates  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the expected life of options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated  or historical volatility  and is expected to fluctuate  or expected volatility  during a period 
given our limited historical stock data since our initial public offering in june  we consider the implied volatility and historical volatility of our stock price in determining our expected volatility 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to share based compensation and the amount of share based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense was million  which relates to unvested stock options  unvested restricted 
table of contents stock units  unvested restricted stock and unvested performance vested restricted stock units  and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of specific financial targets at the end of the specified performance period and the employee s continued employment 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense over the performance period  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of stock based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
based upon our assessment in the fourth quarter of of the probability of achieving specific financial targets related to our performance vested restricted stock units  we revised our estimate of achievement from of target to of target 
the change in this assumption resulted in a reversal of approximately million in compensation expense in the fourth quarter of our consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million and diluted earnings per share was per share 
as a result of this change in estimate  the as adjusted net income would have been approximately million and the as adjusted diluted earnings per share would have been approximately per share had we continued to use the previous estimate of of the performance target 
further changes in our assumptions regarding the achievement of specific financial targets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

current trends affecting our results of operations in  in the face of turbulent economic conditions  we experienced overall increased demand for our services and solutions despite lower than anticipated demand for our ngm services 
in particular  we experienced increased demand for our telephone number portability services in the united states  our expanded range of dns services and the use of us common short codes 
in january  we amended our seven regional contracts with north american portability management llc under which we provide telephone number portability and other clearinghouse services to csps in the united states 
the amendments provide for an annual  fixed fee associated with the telephone number portability services we provide  which is subject to an annual price escalator 
the fixed fee is subject to adjustment in limited circumstances  including an upward or downward adjustment in the event that the volume of transactions in a given year is above or below a contractually established volume range for that year  respectively 
if any such adjustment is 
table of contents triggered  it would be applied in the following year 
we believe that  as the industry continues to evolve and become more complex and as new technologies continue to proliferate  we will experience continued demand for our addressing  interoperability and infrastructure services 
we also believe the amendments to these contracts should facilitate the use of new services by the industry to enable ip routing of voice  short messaging text  and multi media messaging moreover  as our customers begin to rely on us to implement ip based communications  we believe that we will have opportunities for future growth from ancillary directory services 
we continued to see increased demand during for our addressing services from enterprises that require systems capable of handling high volumes of internet traffic 
this demand was a primary driver of revenue growth for our domain name services  particularly ultra services 
we believe that enterprise customers will continue to increase their reliance on the internet and their dns based systems to run their businesses  which will  in turn  increase their reliance on our services  and enable us to increase the scope of services that we provide to these customers and attract new customers that require reliable and scalable dns services 
the revenue we recognized from our ngm services has not grown at the rates we anticipated when we acquired followap in november consequently  at the end of  we repositioned our ngm business so that we could offer enhanced end user experiences  faster deployments  greater operator control and a common infrastructure 
in addition  we began to implement cost cutting measures at ngm to bring our spending to a level that is consistent with demand  while solidifying our position as a key provider of infrastructure that will enable mobile carriers to offer mobile instant messaging and new features and functionalities to their end users 
though the amendment of our contracts to provide telephone number portability services in the united states provides enhanced predictability for a substantial portion of our total revenue  the impact of the current macroeconomic and industry conditions on our organization as a whole is unclear 
during this period of uncertainty  we intend to balance our strategy of continued investment for the long term with careful management of our workforce and operating costs 
overall  our focus is to manage our business to provide strong profitability and cash flows

our principal uses of cash have been to fund acquisitions  stock repurchases  facility expansions  capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements 
we anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be working capital  capital expenditures  facility expansion  stock repurchases and acquisitions 
total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   a decrease from million at december  this decrease was due primarily to the use of million to repurchase shares of our class a common stock and the reclassification of million of investments to long term due to failed auctions for ars held by us 
of the million included in total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  million is invested in a cash reserve fund that has been closed to new investments and immediate redemptions since december the fund currently has a projected redemption schedule that will result in approximately to percent of the fund being redeemed in we have a credit facility that is available for cash borrowings up to million that may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes and to finance acquisitions 
our credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  and events of default 
our credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest charge ratio and a

at december   our long term investments totaled million and consisted of auction rate securities of million whose underlying assets are student loans  of which more than are guaranteed by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program  or ffelp  and million of ars rights 
these auction rate securities are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate approximately every days and allows investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such investments at par 
the underlying maturities of these investments range from to years 
as a result of current negative conditions in the global credit markets  auctions for our million investment in these securities as of december  have failed on their respective settlement dates during the year ended december  consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  they are redeemed by the issuer of the securities or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
given our strong liquidity position and expected cash flows  we do not anticipate the illiquidity of our auction rate securities will materially impact our ability to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
in november  we accepted a settlement offer from the investment firm that brokered the original purchases of the million par value of auction rate securities the settlement gave us the right to sell these securities at par value to the investment firm during a two year period beginning on june  we intend to exercise the rights in june we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
discussion of cash flows compared to cash flows from operations net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of an increase in non cash adjustments of million  including goodwill impairment charges of million  a long lived assets impairment charge of million  million loss on investments held as of december   and a decrease of million relating to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation resulting from decreased sales by employees of stock based awards 
these non cash increases were offset by a non cash gain of million related to our auction rate securities rights offering

the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment date as of december  in thousands less than more than total year years years years in thousands standby letters of credit the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates affects the value of our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge against such risk in our investment portfolio 
we invest in securities of highly rated issuers and follow investment policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments  however  our exposure to this risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  our interest income on our short term investments for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
our long term investments in auction rate securities  or ars  are classified as trading  with changes in fair value due to market changes in interest rates recorded in our earnings each period 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  our interest income for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million related to our ars 
we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local foreign currency and remeasured into the united states dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we sell services 
as of december   our assets and liabilities related to non dollar denominated currencies were primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables 
we do not expect that an increase or decrease of in foreign exchange rate would have a material impact on our financial position 
because our sales and expense are primarily denominated in local currency  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales and expenses has not been material  and we do not employ measures intended to manage foreign exchange rate risk
