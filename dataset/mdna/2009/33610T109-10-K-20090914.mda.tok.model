the company is currently the second largest publicly traded thrift institution in ohio 
since its initial public offering of common stock in  the company has expanded its asset base and product offerings in order to increase both fee income and net income 
growth has been achieved by increasing market 
table of contents share in current markets  expanding into new markets in the midwest by opening de novo loan production and retail banking offices and through acquisitions

financial condition general 
assets at june  totaled billion compared with billion at june   an increase of million or 
we anticipate that future growth will come from a combination of increasing market share in existing markets  the addition of new retail branches  the conversion of loan production offices to business financial centers and acquisitions 
growth by acquisition will be subject to the availability and pricing of appropriate acquisition partners 
securities available for sale 
securities available for sale decreased million during fiscal the decrease was composed of sales and redemptions of million  proceeds from maturities and calls of million  principal paydowns of million  a decrease of million for the change in fair value of securities and a charge of million for other than temporary impairment of securities  partially offset by purchases of million and million in other activity increase in market value 
see the noninterest income section of the comparison of results of operations for the years ended june  and  for further discussion of the impairment charges 
significant reductions in securities are not likely as the company strives to maintain a reasonable level of securities to provide adequate liquidity and in order to have securities available to pledge to secure public funds and other types of transactions 
fluctuations in the market value of securities held by the company relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and management believes  at the date of this report  that all declines in market value in the securities portfolio are temporary 

table of contents loans held for sale 
the company engages in mortgage banking as part of an overall strategy to deliver loan products to customers 
as a result  the company sells most fixed rate residential loan originations and a portion of its adjustable rate residential loan originations 
during fiscal  the company originated billion in one to four family residential loans and sold billion compared to originations of billion and sales of billion in fiscal the company was able to increase the level of sales activity during fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in market share and favorable long term interest rates 
loans held for sale totaled million at june   an increase of million or from million at june  the increase in loans held for sale was due to the higher volume of refinanced loans as a result of favorable long term interest rates during the fourth fiscal quarter of compared to the same period in fiscal also contributing to the increase in loans held for sale was the extension of the holding period from days to days in an effort to increase interest income and net interest margin 
loans 
total loans decreased million or to billion at june   from billion at june  this decrease was composed of decreases of million or in mortgage and construction loans and million or in consumer loans  partially offset by an increase of million or in commercial loans 
the decrease in mortgage and construction loans and consumer loans was the result of deteriorating economic conditions and the tightening of credit underwriting standards during fiscal the company also continued to grow commercial loans during fiscal which brought more diversity and higher yields to the loan portfolio 
at june  the portfolio was of the portfolio was comprised of mortgage and construction loans  of the portfolio was comprised of commercial loans and of the portfolio was comprised of consumer loans compared with of mortgage and construction loans  of commercial loans and of consumer loans as of june  management anticipates the volume of the loan portfolio to remain level or decrease slightly during fiscal and the mix of the loan portfolio to remain relatively unchanged from the mix at june  nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and real estate owned 
the following table presents for the periods indicated the total nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets  as well as the change  expressed in both dollars and percentage

at june  dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans    troubled debt restructurings    total nonperforming loans    real estate owned    total nonperforming assets    ratio nonperforming assets to total assets in the normal course of business  the company continually works with borrowers in various stages of delinquency 
when deemed beneficial for the borrower and the company  concessions are made through modifications of current loan terms with the intention of maximizing the amounts collected on the loan prospectively 
these modified loans are considered troubled debt restructurings under current accounting guidance and are classified as nonperforming loans even if all contractual terms are met 
in the current recessionary economy  these restructurings are becoming more prevalent 
the company also works with borrowers to avoid foreclosure if at all possible 
furthermore  if it becomes inevitable that a borrower will not be able to retain ownership of their property  the company often seeks a deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to gain control of the property earlier in the recovery process 
as a result  real estate owned grew million at june  compared to june  the strategy of pursuing deeds in lieu of foreclosure more aggressively should result in a reduction in the holding period for nonperforming assets and ultimately reduce economic losses 
the increase in nonperforming loans was composed of million of mortgage and construction loans  million of 
table of contents commercial loans  million of consumer loans and million in troubled debt restructurings 
the increase in nonperforming loans was related to a decline in the local economy  particularly in the automotive industry 
this is consistent with both midwest and national trends 
of the total nonperforming loans at june   were secured by real estate 
real estate loans are generally well secured and if these loans do default  a significant amount of the loan balance will be recovered by liquidating the real estate 
included in nonperforming loans at june  were two loans totaling million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company became aware that the collateral pledged on these loans was fraudulent and evidenced by fraudulently altered documents 
the company then requested and received replacement collateral from the borrower  the value of which purportedly exceeded the loan balance 
however  the company is not assured of receiving the full face value of this collateral 
the company placed these loans on nonaccrual and nonperforming status during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company is pursuing all legal avenues to recover the loan balance including legal actions against the borrower and other parties that may have facilitated the fraudulent activity 
if the total loan balance is not realized through a combination of legal actions and liquidation of collateral  the company believes  based on consultation with legal counsel  that it is probable a court would determine the company holds a valid claim under its blanket bond insurance policy and it is therefore probable that a court would determine that the company will recover any ascertainable loss resulting from the company s good faith reliance on the as altered collateral documents 
as a result  a loss on these loans is not believed to be probable at this time and no specific allowance or charge off was recorded at june  allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
all lending activity contains associated risks of loan losses  although the company has not substantially engaged in higher risk products such as subprime loans 
each quarter management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on a review of the loans in the portfolio along with an analysis of external factors and historical delinquency and loss trends 
the allowance is developed through four specific components  the specific allowance for loans subject to individual analysis  the allowance for classified loans not otherwise subject to individual analysis  the allowance for non classified loans primarily homogenous  and the remaining unallocated balance 
classified loans with a balance of million or greater are subject to individual analysis 
loan classifications are those used by regulators consisting of in order of increasing deterioration other assets especially mentioned  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
in evaluating each of these loans for impairment  the measure of expected loss is based on i the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii a loan s observable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
all classified assets under the million threshold are combined with the homogenous loan pools and segregated into twelve loan segments 
the segmentation is based on grouping loans with similar risk characteristics one to four family  construction  home equity  etc loss rate factors are developed for each loan segment which are used to estimate losses and determine an allowance 
the loss rate factors for each segment are derived from historical delinquency  classification  and charge off rates and adjusted for economic factors  a peer comparison factor  and a classification factor 
the economic factors consider unemployment  inflation  foreclosure filings  and bankruptcy filings in the national  ohio and michigan markets 
the peer comparison factor uses nonperforming loan  nonperforming asset  and charge off data from ohio and michigan based banks and thrifts with total asset between million and billion to develop a comparative factor 
the classification factor layers on a premium allowance increasing in weight for each classification grade 
for the remaining non classified loans  historic loss rates are applied to each of the twelve loan segments 
for the historic loss rates compiled for this group of non classified loans  as well as for the delinquency and nonperforming trends compiled for the classified loans  a trend of trailing ten quarters was used 
in contrast to using the trailing quarters used at june   this current compilation captures the more detrimental effects of the current ongoing recession 
the remaining unallocated reserve is not built  but an amount representing a margin of allowance for the inherent inaccuracies in the estimation processes used in determining the specific allowance components and for the risks which may emerge given the current economic conditions 
given the company s focus on the current 
table of contents recessionary economy and the reflection of such on the loss and adjustment factors used in the segmented allowance determination  combined with the reduction of risk achieved through the level of charge offs recorded in the recently completed fourth quarter  management believes the remaining unallocated allowance is appropriately within a reasonable range 
one of the more notable recessionary effects nationwide has been the reduction in real estate values over the past several quarters 
real estate values in ohio and michigan did not experience the dramatic increases over the past decade as in many other sections of the country 
as a result  the declines are not as significant comparatively 
however  with real estate collateralizing a substantial portion of the company s loans  it is critical to determine the impact of any declining values in the allowance determination 
in the evaluation of individual loans of million or greater  current appraisals were obtained wherever practical  or if not available  they were considered in the evaluation process 
in the development of the loss factors used for the classified loan group  foreclosure filings in the ohio and michigan markets were of the weighting in adjusting for the current economy  thus reflecting the effect of declining real estate values 
within the company s residential loan portfolio  less than have loan to value ratios greater than 
conversely  more than of the portfolio has loan to value ratios or less  allowing for some margin of declining real estate value without exposing the company to loss 
in an effort to limit the company s exposure to real estate related losses  multiple reviews of credit scores were performed on existing home equity lines over the past year 
in instances where the score had fallen below a satisfactory level  caps were placed on the lines or the lines were frozen at their current balance in order to limit exposure in a deteriorating situation 
based on variables involved and the fact that management must make judgments about outcomes that are uncertain  the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy 
in addition to the analysis and procedures just described  the company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent review of commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the company uses the results of this review to help determine the effectiveness of the existing policies and procedures  and to provide an independent assessment of the allowance for loan losses allocated to these types of loans 
the allowance for loan losses was million at june   up million from million at june  net charge offs during fiscal were million  an increase of million from net charge offs of million during fiscal net charge offs to average loans increased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal the mix and composition of portfolio loans and nonperforming loans changes from year to year 
when the company sets the allowance for loan losses  it is dependent on a detailed analysis of different ratios which may not move in the same direction 
as a result  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans at june  decreased from the prior year while the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at june  increased from the prior year 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans for the company was at june  compared with at june  additionally  the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at june  compared with at june  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was at june   up from at june  deposits 
total deposits were billion at june   an increase of million  compared with billion at june  the increase in deposits was comprised of increases of million in certificates of deposit and million in checking accounts  partially offset by decreases of million in savings accounts and million in money market accounts 
the largest deposit category was certificates of deposit  which represented of deposits at june  compared with as of june  the million increase in certificates of deposit during the fiscal year was comprised of increases of million in brokered deposits and million in retail certificates of deposit partially offset by a decrease of million in public funds 
retail certificates of deposit grew during fiscal at june   the company had million in brokered deposits with original maturities from one to months compared with million at june  the company considers brokered deposits to be an element of a diversified funding strategy and an alternative to borrowings 
management regularly compares rates to determine the most economical source of funding 
the company anticipates that it will continue to consider brokered funds as a funding alternative in the future and as a source of short term liquidity  but not as the primary source of fund 
table of contents ing to support growth 
currently  the office of thrift supervision ots  the company s primary regulator  has limited the company s brokered deposits to approximately million 
the company participates in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program  a network of financial institutions that exchange funds among members in order to ensure federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage on customer deposits above the single institution limit 
these deposits are considered brokered deposits and are included in the brokered deposit totals above 
using a sophisticated matching system  funds are exchanged on a dollar for dollar basis  so that the equivalent of an original deposit comes back to the originating institution 
included in certificates of deposit at june  are cdars balances of million  an increase of million from the million at june  with the instability in the financial markets over the past year  many customers with funds in excess of the insured limit of thousand are looking for safer investment alternatives and finding that in the cdars program 
short term borrowings and long term debt 
short term borrowings increased million to million at june   after an million reclassification of borrowings from long term debt to short term borrowings 
long term debt decreased million to million at june   compared with million at june  the decrease was due to the million reclassification of borrowings from long term debt to short term borrowings 
included in long term debt throughout the year were million of junior subordinated debentures 
the company uses short term borrowings and long term debt as part of its liquidity management  cash flow  and asset liability management and considers them to be part of a diversified funding strategy 
short term borrowings and long term debt are alternatives to raising cash through deposit growth and are used when they offer a favorable alternative to deposits in terms of rate  maturity or volume 
currently  the company may not incur additional debt without ots approval 
for additional information on short term borrowings and long term debt  see note short term borrowings and long term debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to june   the company obtained a million line of credit with a commercial bank 
borrowings from the commercial bank are unsecured 
interest on the line accrues daily and is variable based on the lending bank s federal funds rate 
capital resources 
total shareholders equity decreased million to million at june   compared with million at june  this decrease was primarily composed of the net loss for fiscal of million and million of cash dividends declared on the company s common stock  partially offset by the issuance of million of preferred stock and a common stock warrant in connection with the company s participation in the us department of the treasury s treasury capital purchase program cpp and million in comprehensive income 
in connection with the issuance of the preferred stock and common stock warrant to the treasury  the ability to declare or pay dividends on the company s common shares is limited to per share per quarter  and only if all dividends have been paid on the series a preferred shares 
in addition  the ability to repurchase common shares is restricted by the approval of the treasury and again only if there are no payments in arrears on the series a preferred share dividends 
for more information on the company s participation in cpp  see note participation in the us department of the treasury s troubled asset relief program in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
beginning in the third fiscal quarter of  the company decreased the quarterly dividend to per common share compared with per common share in the prior two quarters 
these reductions drove the annual dividend to in from in at its regular meeting held on july   the board of directors declared a per common share cash dividend of 
the board s decision to reduce the quarterly cash dividend aids in preserving existing capital available to weather the current economic conditions or to be available to support future growth 
currently  the company may not pay cash dividends to common shareholders without ots approval 
the ots regulations require savings institutions to maintain certain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
additionally  the regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
generally  an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a core tier capital ratio of 
table of contents at least based on adjusted total assets  a core tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
at june   the bank s capital levels exceeded the levels required to be well capitalized 
see the liquidity and cash flows section of this report for a discussion of dividends as a source of funding for the company and dividend restrictions imposed on the bank by the ots 
on november   the company s shareholders approved an amendment to the company s restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from  to  on february   the company filed its amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the state of delaware 
the company s board of directors authorized separate common stock repurchase programs in march and august for the combined repurchase of  common shares in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions through march during fiscal  the company repurchased  common shares at an average price of per common share 
stock repurchase programs are a component of the company s strategy to invest excess capital after consideration of market and economic factors  the effect on shareholder dilution  adequacy of capital  effect on liquidity and an assessment of alternative investment returns 
common shares repurchased by the company may be used to meet the company s requirements for common shares under its dividend reinvestment plan  stock option or other stock based plans and for general corporate purposes such as expansion and acquisitions or future capital requirements 
there were no common shares repurchased after march when the board authorizations to repurchase these shares expired 
currently  the company may not repurchase common shares without ots approval 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations 
the company uses a variety of funding sources to finance its earning assets and other activities 
these contractual obligations have various terms and maturities that may require the outlay of cash in the future 
the company also enters into contracts such as lease obligations or purchase obligations that commit the company to make future payments for the acquisition of goods or services needed for the normal conduct of its business 
the following table summarizes those obligations as of june  by type and by payment date 
the amounts represent the amounts contractually due and do not include any interest  premiums  discounts or other similar carrying value adjustments

off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into arrangements that are not included in the statements of financial position 
they include commitments to make loans  commitments to sell loans  guarantees under letters of credit  interests in securities or derivatives used to hedge the value of 
table of contents loans held for sale and the use of wholly owned unconsolidated special purpose entities that act as trusts to facilitate the sale of debt securities to the public 
as a lending institution  the company makes commitments to lend money before loans are disbursed in order to serve the needs of borrowers 
at june   the company had commitments to make loans totaling million and these loan commitments are similar in form and terms to loans previously originated by the company 
they are underwritten using the same policies and criteria the company uses to underwrite loans 
therefore  these commitments do not present credit risks that are different from the credit risks in the existing loan portfolio 
the company does have interest rate risk on loan commitments and loans held for sale between the time a rate commitment is made to the borrower and the time the company contracts for the sale of the loan 
this risk is minimized by issuing commitments to sell loans or mortgage backed securities to offset this interest rate risk 
at june   the company had million in commitments to sell mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  at june   the company had funding obligations represented by million in unused lines of credit and letters of credit and million in construction loan funds approved that the borrower has not yet requested be advanced

date us year treasury bond rate target federal funds rate difference while long term rates  represented by the year us treasury rate  have declined basis points over the past two years  short term rates  as represented by the targeted federal funds rate  declined basis points during the same period 
as a result  the yield curve  which had an inverted slope at june   changed to a positively sloped yield curve during fiscal and steepened significantly through fiscal net interest income 
the table in the section titled average balances  interest rates and yields provides important information on factors impacting net interest income and should be read in conjunction with this discussion of net interest income 
interest income and the resulting asset yields in the following table are stated on a fully tax equivalent basis 
therefore  they will vary slightly from interest income in the consolidated statements of income included in the consolidated financial statements 
interest income for the year ended june   totaled million  a decrease of million from million for the year ended june  interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june   a decrease of million 
the decrease in interest income on loans was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on loans of to for fiscal compared with for prior fiscal year and an increase in nonperforming loans  partially offset by an increase of million in the average balance of loans 
the yield on loans decreased as loans originated in prior years were paid off and were replaced by loans with lower current market rates 
in addition  the mix of loans in the portfolio changed to include a greater percentage of commercial loans  which carry yields based on a variable rate index prime rate that decreased during fiscal interest income on securities decreased million and totaled million for the year ended june   compared with million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest income on securities was due to a basis point decrease in the average yield  partially offset by a million increase in the average balance of securities 
interest expense for the year ended june   was million  a decrease of million from million for the prior year ended june  interest expense on deposits decreased million to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits  partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing deposit balances 
average interest bearing deposit balances increased million to billion for the year ended june   compared with billion for the year ended june  the primary reason for the increase in average interest bearing deposits was to provide funds in the form of short term borrowings for the increase in loans held for sale and address liquidity concerns in the current economic environment 
the average interest rate of deposits decreased basis points to for fiscal compared with for the previous year 
the decrease in average cost of deposits was due to the government driven decrease in short term interest rates which impacted certificates of deposit and nonmaturity deposit accounts 
interest expense on short term borrowings increased million to million for fiscal from million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest expense on short term borrowings was primarily due to an increase in average short term borrowings  partially offset by lower average short term interest rates 
the million increase of average short term borrowings from fiscal to fiscal was primarily used to fund the increase in loans held for sale 
interest expense on long term borrowings decreased million and was million for the year ended june   down from million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in the average balance of long term debt and lower average long term interest rates during fiscal than in fiscal the cost of long term debt includes the amortization of the losses from 
table of contents the termination of interest rate swaps in august those losses are being amortized over the original term of the swaps through july interest rate swap amortization expense was million for fiscal years and scheduled interest rate swap amortization for fiscal is million 
for additional information on borrowings and interest rate swaps  see note short term borrowings and long term debt and note interest rate swaps in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net interest income for the year ended june  totaled million compared with million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
this increase was due primarily due to a million increase in interest earning assets which was driven by funds received from cpp and the oc financial acquisition at the end of fiscal both asset yields and liability costs decreased during fiscal as older loans and certificates of deposits matured or were paid off and were replaced by new instruments at lower interest rates 
the net result was a seven basis point increase in the interest rate spread 
while the net interest spread increased  the net interest margin decreased five basis points to for fiscal compared with for fiscal the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to the lower percentage growth of net interest income compared to the percentage growth of interest earning assets 
the lower percentage growth in net interest income was due in part to the increase in nonaccrual loans during fiscal in addition  the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased at a faster pace than the average balance of interest earning assets during fiscal average balances  interest rates and yields

the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in fully tax equivalent interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the increase or decrease related to changes in balances and or changes in interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate and ii changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume 
for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate 
this table analyzes the change between years in fully tax equivalent net interest income

the provision for loan losses represents the charge to income necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that represents management s assessment of the estimated probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for a more detailed discussion of management s assessment of the allowance for loan losses  see the allowance for loan losses section under financial condition in management s discussion and analysis 
based on this assessment  the provision for loan losses was million for fiscal  which represents an increase of million from million for fiscal net charge offs during fiscal were million  an increase of million from net charge offs of million during fiscal net charge offs to average loans increased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal nonperforming loans increased million or to million at june   compared with million at june  the allowance for loan losses was increased to a level deemed adequate by management  after review  to cover the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at june  the allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to at june   from a year earlier 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased to million for the year ended june   from million for the prior year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to the decline in fair value of securities and decreases in loan servicing income  gain on sale of loan servicing rights and other income nonbank subsidiaries  partially offset by a decrease in the charge for impairment of securities and increases in mortgage banking gains and service charges and fees on deposit accounts 

table of contents effective july   the company elected to account for certain equity investments and a mortgage backed securities mutual fund at fair value under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 the fair value option for assets and financial liabilities sfas 
as a result  the current decrease and future increases and decreases in the value of these securities will be recorded in earnings 
there was no impact to adopting fair value for these securities as of july  as the company had previously recorded them at fair value on june  under the other than temporary impairment guidelines 
the million decline in the fair value of securities for was due to declines in the mortgage backed securities mutual fund investment and fannie mae preferred stock 
the decline in the value of the mutual fund investment to million at june  from million at june  was due to increases in the spreads between the yield of the underlying mortgage backed securities and treasury yields related to credit quality concerns 
the decline in the fair value of fannie mae preferred stock was caused by government actions within the past year placing fannie mae under conservatorship and suspending future dividends 
all fannie mae preferred stock was sold during fiscal year loan servicing income decreased million to a loss of million for fiscal loan servicing income is composed of the current fees generated from the servicing of sold loans less the current amortization of mortgage servicing rights msrs and the adjustment for any change in the allowance for impairment of msrs  which are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of msrs is a critical accounting policy and the company utilizes the services of an independent firm to determine market value 
both the amortization and the valuation of msrs are sensitive to movements in interest rates 
both amortization and impairment valuation allowances tend to increase as rates fall and tend to decrease as rates rise 
however  the level of amortization is a function of interest rates over the period while the level of impairment valuation allowances is a function of interest rates at the end of the period 
interest rates were at higher levels two years ago on june  during the past three years  both short term and long term interest rates have varied significantly and have not moved in tandem resulting in significant shifts in the shape and slope of the yield curve 
the level and variability in interest rates over that period has resulted in significant variations in loan servicing income  including changes in the level of impairment of msrs 
the table below shows how the change in the impairment of msrs has impacted loan servicing income over the past two years

year ended june  dollars in thousands loan servicing income loan servicing revenue net of amortization  change in impairment of msrs total loan servicing income loss  loan servicing income decreased due primarily to the sale of of the loan servicing portfolio in september the increase in impairment was due to long term interest rates declining significantly during fiscal compared with long term interest rates only declining slightly during fiscal at june   there was million of allowance for impairment of msrs compared with million at june over the past several years  the volume and dollar value of loan servicing rights has been growing more rapidly than total assets on a percentage basis 
as a result  the company s exposure to volatility in mortgage banking revenue has also increased 
in order to reduce exposure to volatility due to rapid payoffs or impairment  the company sold loan servicing rights with a cost basis of million  approximately of its loan servicing rights portfolio  in september gain on the sale of these loan servicing rights was million in fiscal there were no sales of loan servicing rights in the current year 
historically the company has sold loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
management plans to consider additional sales of msrs in the future depending on the size of the servicing asset relative to total assets and based on the current market for the sale of msrs 
as of june  the company was selling approximately of loans with servicing released compared with in 
table of contents other income nonbank subsidiaries decreased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the decrease was due primarily to decreases in investment and real estate commissions related to the economic slowdown in the company s market area 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require a company to make a determination whether impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
among other determining factors  other than temporary impairment occurs when the market value of a security falls significantly below amortized cost and there is a low probability of the security recovering its loss in the near term 
if securities are impaired and the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the securities are written down by recording a charge to the income statement 
for the year ended june   other than temporary impairment of securities was million compared to million in the prior year 
the impairment of securities in was composed of a million charge related to equity securities 
the impairment of securities in was composed of a million charge related to fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock  a million charge related to two mutual fund securities and a million charge related to equity securities 
the equity securities that were other than temporarily impaired had a value of thousand at june  neither the million impairment charge in nor the million impairment charge in had any effect on total capital or the net asset value of the securities as they had already been written down to their market value as available for sale securities with the corresponding charge recorded in other comprehensive income 
a review for other than temporary impairment was performed as of june  on the million portfolio of trust preferred securities  which has declined in value by million from a cost basis of million 
the trust preferred securities portfolio consists of large single issuers with investment grade credit ratings of baa or higher by moody s  which are within the company s investment policy guidelines 
each of the issuers is a recipient of the us department of the treasury s tarp funding  has not deferred interest on their obligations and is well capitalized 
the million decline  which was as high as million at march   is attributable to the historically low level of interest rates  lack of liquidity in the trust preferred securities market and a lack of confidence in the entire financial institution capital market 
therefore  there is no evidence that the decline is other than temporary 
as this variable rate portfolio is based on three month libor  it trades at a deep discount to its fixed rate counterparts 
upon a return to normalcy in the financial markets within the one to two year horizon and the eventual higher levels of interest rates  this portfolio is expected to recover 
the company has the intent to hold these securities through their recovery period and is not likely to sell these securities for liquidity purposes  thus no other than temporary impairment has been recognized in the current quarter or year to date period 
the company will continue to monitor these securities and the events and conditions which have an impact on their values and make impairment decisions as necessary prospectively 
mortgage banking gains increased or million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gains in fiscal averaged basis points on billion in sales compared with basis points on billion of loan sales in fiscal the increase in mortgage banking gains was primarily due to an increase in the volume of loans sold due to the exit or contraction of certain competitors 
also contributing to the increase in mortgage banking gains was higher margins on sales of loans 
the level of loan originations  sales and gains on the sale of loans are all results that tend to vary inversely with interest rates 
loan activity tends to increase as interest rates decrease and loan activity tends to decrease as interest rates increase 
in conjunction with favorable long term mortgage interest rates during fiscal  the company was able to increase mortgage banking activity levels by selectively adding experienced  successful loan officers and by concentrating on servicing customers seeking to refinance their existing homes 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the increase in service charges and fees on deposit accounts was primarily due to the impact of fees generated from a new overdraft program  which began december  and the addition of retail banking offices of hbls bank acquired in october and oc financial acquired in june 
table of contents net gain on sale of securities was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal securities may be sold to respond to liquidity needs  to impact interest rate risk  to maximize total returns on securities or to minimize losses on securities in anticipation of changes in interest rates 
the company does not anticipate that gains or losses on the sale of securities will be a major component of net income 
however  the purchase and sale of securities do play a significant part in managing the overall liquidity  credit and interest rate risk of the company 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended june  totaled million compared with million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
annualized noninterest expense to average assets was for fiscal compared with for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in noninterest expense was the charge for goodwill impairment and increases in real estate owned expense  federal deposit insurance premiums and salaries and employee benefits 
the company incurred a million charge for goodwill impairment during based upon management s evaluation of goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as amended 
for a more detailed discussion of management s evaluation of goodwill impairment  see note goodwill  core deposit and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
real estate owned expense for the year ended june  totaled million compared with million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
the increase in real estate owned expense was primarily due to charges related to the decrease in the value of residential and commercial properties  and an increase in the volume of properties 
the company s comprehensive program to recognize declines in value is crucial to selling the properties and reducing nonperforming assets 
fdic premiums for the year ended june  totaled million compared with million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in fdic premiums resulted from increases in premium rates and deposit balances along with the exhaustion of credits issued in and a fdic special assessment of million 
the fdic special assessment was required of all fdic insured institutions 
salaries and employee benefits for the year ended june  totaled million compared with million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to the company changing its organizational structure to manage by product line rather than geographic region in order to utilize employees more efficiently 
this resulted in the elimination of certain positions by consolidating similar positions that existed in more than one region 
as a result  there were severance costs incurred 
salaries and employee benefits also increased due to an increase in health care costs and the impact of employees added with the oc financial acquisition in june provision for income taxes 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded for the current fiscal year  a decrease of million from prior year income tax expense of million 
the decrease in the income tax expense was due to the substantial decrease in pretax income 
the effective tax benefit rate for the current fiscal year was compared with an effective tax rate of for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the overall effective tax rate was primarily due to a substantial decrease in pretax income related to the goodwill impairment charge  of which a relatively minor tax benefit was gained  while nontaxable income from municipal securities and insurance contracts remained relatively constant 
comparison of results of operations for years ended june  and general 
for the year ended june   the company recorded net income of million  a decrease of or million  from net income of million for the year ended june  diluted earnings per common share for the year ended june  were  a decrease of compared to for the year ended june  the current year was negatively impacted by provision for loan losses  impairment of securities  real estate owned expense and merger costs associated with the acquisitions of hbls bank and oc financial and the prior year was negatively impacted by merger costs associated with the purchase of retail banking offices from citizens

table of contents net interest income  loan servicing income  net gains on sales of loans  loan growth and deposit growth are all significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
a review of activity in interest rates over the past two years is helpful in understanding changes in volumes and the levels of certain income statement categories

date us year treasury bond rate target federal funds rate difference while long term rates  represented by the year us treasury rate  have declined basis points over the past two years  short term rates  as represented by the targeted federal funds rate  declined basis points during the same period 
as a result  the yield curve  which had an inverted slope at june   and remained inverted through fiscal  changed to a positive sloped yield curve during fiscal net interest income 
the table in the section titled average balances  interest rates and yields provides important information on factors impacting net interest income and should be read in conjunction with this discussion of net interest income 
interest income and the resulting asset yields in the following table are stated on a fully tax equivalent basis 
therefore  they will vary slightly from interest income in the consolidated statements of income included in the consolidated financial statements 
interest income for the year ended june   totaled million  an increase of million from million for the year ended june  interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of loans  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans of to for fiscal compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the yield on loans decreased as loans originated in prior years were paid off and were replaced by loans with lower current market rates 
in addition  the mix of loans in the portfolio changed to include a greater percentage of commercial loans  which carry yields based on a variable rate index prime rate that decreased during fiscal interest income on securities decreased million and totaled million for the year ended june   compared with million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest income on securities was due to a basis point decrease in the average yield  partially offset by an million increase in the average balance of securities 
interest expense for the year ended june   was million  an increase of million from million for the prior year ended june  interest expense on deposits increased million to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  due to an increase in average interest bearing deposit balances  partially offset by a slight decrease in the average cost of deposits 
average interest bearing deposit balances increased million to billion for the year ended june   compared with billion for the year ended june  the primary reason for the increase in average interest bearing deposits was the purchase of retail banking offices with deposit balances of million from citizens in april  the hbls bank acquisition in october which included million in deposits and an increase of million in retail deposits during fiscal the average cost of deposits decreased nine basis points to for fiscal compared with for the previous year 
that decrease was due to the decrease in short term interest rates which impacted both the cost of certificates of deposit and nonmaturity deposit accounts 
interest expense on short term borrowings decreased million to million from million for the prior year due to a decrease in average short term borrowings and lower average short term interest rates during fiscal than in fiscal the million reduction of average 
table of contents short term borrowings from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to the million in cash received from the citizens acquisition in april that was used to reduce short term borrowings and the additional long term debt incurred to lock in historically low interest rates 
interest expense on long term borrowings increased million and was million for the year ended june   up from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of long term borrowings  partially offset by lower average long term interest rates during fiscal than in fiscal the cost of long term borrowings includes the amortization of the losses from the termination of interest rate swaps in august those losses are being amortized over the original term of the swaps through interest rate swap amortization expense was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal net interest income for the year ended june  totaled million versus million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
this increase was due primarily due to a million increase in interest earning assets which was driven by loan growth  the citizens acquisition near the end of fiscal and the hbls bank acquisition in october both asset yields and liability costs decreased during fiscal as older loans and certificates of deposits matured or were paid off and were replaced by new instruments at lower interest rates 
the net result was a four basis point decrease in the interest rate spread 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for fiscal compared with for fiscal both spread and net interest margin decreased due to the average yield on interest earnings assets decreasing more than the average cost on interest bearing liabilities and the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increasing more than the average balance of interest earning assets during fiscal provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for fiscal  which represents an increase of million from million for fiscal net charge offs during fiscal were million  an increase of million from fiscal net charge offs to average loans increased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal nonperforming loans increased million or to million at june   compared with million at june  the allowance for loan losses was increased to a level deemed adequate by management  after review  to cover the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at june  the allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to at june   from a year earlier 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased to million for the year ended june   from million for the prior year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to a charge for impairment of securities  and decreases in loan servicing income and other income nonbank subsidiaries  partially offset by increases in service charges and fees on deposit accounts  mortgage banking gains and gain on sale of loan servicing rights 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require a company to make a determination whether impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
among other determining factors  other than temporary impairment occurs when the market value of a security falls significantly below amortized cost and there is a low probability of the security recovering its loss in the near term 
all of the securities currently on the books of the company are classified as available for sale 
therefore  all securities are recorded in the statement of condition at market value 
this is accomplished by a credit or charge to other comprehensive income  and those market value changes are not reflected in the income statement 
if securities are impaired and the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the securities are written down by reversing the existing charge to other comprehensive income and recording a charge to the income statement 
for the year ended june   other than temporary impairment of securities was million compared to none in the prior year 
the impairment of securities was composed of a million charge related to fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock  a million charge related to two mutual fund securities and a million charge related to equity securities 
recent capital restructuring at fannie mae and freddie mac and developments in the residential mortgage business have resulted in impairment of these securities 
due to the uncertainty of future market conditions and how they might impact the financial performance of fannie mae and freddie mac  management was unable to determine when or if this impairment will be reversed in the foreseeable future 
at june   the company owned  shares of series f and  shares of series g of fannie mae preferred stock with a value of million 
during fiscal  the company sold all of the freddie mac preferred stock that it previously owned 
the two mutual funds were primarily invested in 
table of contents agency backed and privately issued mortgage securities that did not have any significant exposure to subprime mortgages 
changes in the interest rate environment and the market for mortgage backed securities along with downgrades of the ratings of individual mortgage backed securities within these funds has led management to conclude that these securities are other than temporarily impaired 
during fiscal  the company sold one of the mutual funds and the remaining fund has a current value of million at june  the equity securities that were other than temporarily impaired had a value of thousand at june  the million impairment charge did not have any effect on total capital or the net asset value of the securities as they had already been written down to their market value as available for sale securities with the corresponding charge recorded in other comprehensive income 
loan servicing income decreased million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal loan servicing income is composed of the current fees generated from the servicing of sold loans less the current amortization of mortgage servicing rights msrs and the adjustment for any change in the allowance for impairment of msrs  which are valued at the lower of cost or market

noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended june  totaled million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
annualized noninterest expense to average assets was for fiscal compared with for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in noninterest expense was the operating expense for the increases in retail branch locations and loan production offices and the increase in real estate owned expense  partially offset by a decrease in state and local taxes 
salaries and employee benefits increased or million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal for the year ended june   occupancy and equipment increased million to million and merger  integration and restructuring expense increased million to million 
the increases in salaries and employee benefits and occupancy and equipment were related to the increases in retail branch locations and loan production offices 
at march   the company had branch locations 
in april  seven branches were acquired from citizens 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the hbls bank was acquired and a de novo branch was opened 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  oc financial was acquired bringing the total number of retail branches to or a increase from march  real estate owned expense increased million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the increase in real estate owned expense was due primarily to the volume of properties added to real estate owned over the past fiscal year 
state and local tax expense decreased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the current fiscal year was million  a decrease of million from the prior year expense of million 
the decrease in the income tax expense was due to the decrease in pretax income 
the effective tax rate for the current fiscal year was compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the overall effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income while nontaxable income from municipal securities and insurance contracts remained relatively constant 
liquidity and cash flows liquidity is the company s ability to generate adequate cash flows to meet the demands of its customers and provide adequate flexibility for the company to take advantage of market opportunities 
cash is used to fund loans  purchase investments  fund the maturity of liabilities  and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities 
the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and sales of loans  maturities  sales and principal receipts from securities  borrowings  the issuance of debt or equity securities and operations 
managing liquidity entails balancing the need for cash or the ability to borrow against the objectives of maximizing profitability and minimizing interest rate risk 
the most liquid types of assets typically carry the lowest yields 

table of contents since the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac in september and the series of financial dilemmas at a national level that transpired thereafter  the condition of the financial markets has deteriorated 
from a liquidity standpoint  the government s support of the secondary mortgage market has allowed a primary business function of the company to continue uninhibited 
mortgage originations totaled billion for fiscal  while loans sold were billion 
with the recent decline in mortgage rates  refinance activity has been robust  and the company expects to continue to originate and sell loans at a turnover rate of or higher 
should there be any inability to securitize loan originations resulting from deteriorating market conditions  the company may opt to curtail originations 
at june   the company had million of cash and unpledged securities available to meet cash needs 
unpledged securities can be sold or pledged to secure additional borrowings 
also  the company had additional borrowing capacity of million from the federal reserve bank under the discount window program at june  however  the company had no additional borrowing capacity from the federal home loan bank at june  this compares to million of cash and unpledged securities  federal home loan bank availability of million  federal reserve bank availability of million and million of availability in unsecured commercial bank lines of credit at june  during the fiscal year  million of unsecured commercial bank lines of credit were terminated 
subsequent to june   the bank obtained a million line of credit with a commercial bank 
borrowings from the commercial bank are unsecured 
interest on the line accrues daily and is variable based on the lending bank s federal funds rate 
potential cash available as measured by liquid assets and borrowing capacity has increased million at june  compared to june  management receives reports on liquidity on a regular basis and considers the level of liquidity in setting both loan and deposit rates 
in addition to the sources of funds listed above  the company has the ability to raise additional funds by increasing deposit rates relative to competition in national markets by accelerating the sales of loans held for sale  or by selling loans currently held in the loan portfolio 
deposits raised in national markets include brokered deposits 
at june   the company had million of brokered deposits 
brokered deposits are a secondary source of liquidity and can be used as an alternative to local deposits when national rates are lower than local deposit rates 
unlike correspondent banking relationships which have tightened in the current market  brokered deposits have continued to offer funds at competitive rates 
current ots restrictions  however  limit the company s brokered deposit balances to million 
the company could raise up to million of senior unsecured debt issuances guaranteed under the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program  with prior written approval by the fdic 
the fdic created this program to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts and certain holding companies  and by providing full  unlimited coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts 
management believes that the current and potential resources mentioned are adequate to meet liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
the company  as a savings and loan holding company  has more limited sources of liquidity 
in addition to its existing liquid assets  it can raise funds in the securities markets through debt or equity offerings or it can receive dividends from its subsidiaries 
any debt offerings or cash dividends of the company require prior approval of the ots 
cash can be used by the holding company to make acquisitions  pay quarterly interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures  pay dividends to common shareholders  pay dividends on the perpetual preferred stock issued to the treasury and to fund operating expenses 
at june   the company had cash and unpledged securities of million available to meet cash needs 
annual debt service on the junior subordinated debentures is approximately million 
annual dividends to be paid on the perpetual preferred stock will be approximately million 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the company by the bank without prior approval of the ots 
generally  the bank may pay dividends without prior approval as long as the dividend is not more than the total of the current calendar year to date earnings plus any earnings from the previous two years not already paid out in dividends  and as long as the bank would remain well capitalized after the dividend payment 
as of june   the bank can pay no dividends to the company without ots approval 
future dividend payments by the bank to the company would be based upon future earnings and the approval of the ots 
at june   the company borrowed million through repurchase agreements with various financial institutions 
these financial institutions are evaluated with regards to their financial stability before entering into the repurchase transaction and are evaluated on a regular basis until the repurchase agreement matures

impact of inflation consolidated financial data included herein has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
presently  gaap requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historical dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or deflation are generally not considered 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of the company to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not move concurrently 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation  as well as changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
a financial institution s ability to be relatively unaffected by changes in interest rates is a good indicator of its capability to perform in a volatile economic environment 
in an effort to protect itself from the effects of interest rate volatility  the company reviews its interest rate risk position frequently  monitoring its exposure and taking necessary steps to minimize any detrimental effects on the company s profitability 
critical accounting policies the company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
some of these accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain 
application of assumptions different from those used by management could have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
these policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
these policies include the policies to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights  other than temporary impairment of securities and goodwill impairment 
these policies  current assumptions and estimates utilized and the related disclosure of this process are determined by management and reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
details of the policies and the nature of the estimates follow 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
each quarter management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance based on a review of the loans in the portfolio along with an analysis of external factors 
loans are reviewed individually  or in the case of small homogeneous loans  in the aggregate  by applying a factor based on historical loss experience 
an allowance is established for probable credit losses on impaired loans 
nonperforming commercial loans exceeding policy thresholds are regularly reviewed to identify impairment 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts contractually due 
measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates  and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates 
impairment is measured primarily based upon the fair value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  or alternatively  the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan s effective rate 
when the selected measure is less than the recorded investment in the loans impairment has occurred 
this review includes historical data  the ability of the borrower to meet the terms of the loan  an evaluation of the collateral securing the loan  various collection strategies and other factors relevant to the loan or loans 
external factors considered include but are not limited to economic conditions  current interest rates  trends in the borrower s industry and the market for various types of collateral 
in addition  overall information about the loan portfolio or segments of the portfolio is considered  including delinquency statistics and workout experience based on factors such as historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and current economic conditions 
as a result  determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses involves not only evaluating the current financial situation of individual borrowers or groups of borrowers but also current predictions about future cash flows that could change before an actual loss is determined 
based on the variables involved and the fact that management must make judgments about outcomes that are uncertain  the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy 

table of contents one of the tools utilized by management to determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses is the grading of individual loans according to the severity of the credit issues 
an illustration of the sensitivity of this system to changes in conditions or changes in estimates follows 
the most serious grading a loan can receive is to be classified as a loss 
a loan classified in the loss grade would be reserved and would be subject to charge off 
the next most serious grade is identified as doubtful 
at june   the company had million of loans classified as doubtful 
if all of these loans were to deteriorate and become classified as a loss  the allowance for loan losses would need to increase by million 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing assets represent the value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
when loans are sold or securitized and the servicing rights are retained  the initial servicing right is recorded at its fair value 
the basis assigned to the mortgage servicing right is amortized in proportion to and over the life of the net revenue anticipated to be received from servicing the loan 
mortgage servicing rights are valued at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
fair value is measured by stratifying the portfolio of loan servicing rights into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
when the amortized cost of a group of loans exceeds the fair value  an allowance for impairment is recorded to reduce the value of the mortgage servicing rights to fair value 
fair value for each group of loans is determined quarterly by obtaining an appraisal from an independent third party 
that appraisal is based on a modeling process in conjunction with information on recent bulk and flow sales of mortgage servicing rights 
some of the assumptions used in the modeling process are prepayment speeds  delinquency rates  servicing costs  periods to hold idle cash  returns currently available on idle cash  and a discount rate  which takes into account the current rate of return anticipated by holders of servicing rights 
the process of determining the fair value of servicing rights involves a number of judgments and estimates including the way loans are grouped  the estimation of the various assumptions used by recent buyers and a projection of how those assumptions may change in the future 
the most important variable in valuing servicing rights is the level of interest rates 
long term interest rates are the primary determinant of prepayment speeds while short term interest rates determine the return available on idle cash 
the process of estimating the value of loan servicing rights is further complicated by the fact that short term and long term interest rates may change in a similar magnitude and direction or may change independent of each other 
the following table indicates how changes in assumptions about the prepayment speeds in the mortgage loan servicing portfolio would affect the fair value of the portfolio  as of the date of the most recent outside quarterly evaluation date  may

table of contents loan prepayment speeds have varied significantly over the past three years and could continue to vary in the future 
in addition  any of the other variables mentioned above could change over time 
therefore  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is  and is expected to continue to be  a critical accounting policy where the results are based on estimates that are subject to change over time and can have a significant financial impact on the company 
other than temporary impairment of securities 
the company monitors securities in its portfolio for other than temporary impairment 
the company considers various factors in determining if impairment is other than temporary  including but not limited to the length of time and extent the security s fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and external credit ratings of the issuer  the company s intent and ability to hold the security for a period sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value and general market conditions 
in determining if impairment is other than temporary in nature  the company must use certain judgments and assumptions in interpreting market data for the likelihood of recovery in fair value 
securities are written down to fair value when a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
other than temporary valuation losses on securities are reported in the consolidated statements of income under the noninterest income caption other than temporary impairment of securities 
goodwill impairment 
the company annually reviews recorded goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter 
however  if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company or its reporting units below its carrying amount  then goodwill is tested between annual tests 
the company follows a two step process to test for impairment 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the company with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the company s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  but limited to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
goodwill impairment is reported in the consolidated statements of income under the noninterest expense caption goodwill impairment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to market risk 
market risk is the type of risk that occurs when a company suffers economic loss due to changes in the market value of various types of assets or liabilities 
as a financial institution  the company makes a profit by accepting and managing various risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the company s primary market risk 
it is the risk that occurs when changes in market interest rates will result in a reduction in net interest income or net interest margin because interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities mature at different intervals and reprice at different times 
asset liability management is the measurement and analysis of the company s exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
the objective of the company s asset liability management function is to balance the goal of maximizing net interest income with the control of risks in the areas of liquidity  safety  capital adequacy and earnings volatility 
in general  the company s customers seek loans with long term fixed rates and deposit products with shorter maturities which creates a mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
the company s primary strategy to counteract this mismatch is to sell the majority of long term fixed rate loans within days after they are closed 
the company manages this risk and other aspects of interest rate risk on a continuing basis through a number of functions including review of monthly financial results  rate setting  cash forecasting and planning  budgeting and an asset liability committee 
on a quarterly basis  the asset liability committee reviews the results of an interest rate risk model that forecasts changes in net interest income and net portfolio value npv  based on one or more interest rate scenarios 
npv is the market value of financial assets less the market value of financial liabilities 
npv is performed as of a single point in time and does not include estimates of future business volumes 
the model combines detailed information on existing assets and liabilities with an interest rate forecast  loan prepayment speed assumptions and assumptions about how those assets and liabilities will react to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  customer product and term selection  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as differences in how interest rates change at various points along the yield curve 
the results below indicate how npv would change based on various changes in interest rates 
the projections are as of june   and a year earlier and are based on an instantaneous change in interest rates and assume that short term and long term rates change by the same magnitude and in the same direction

basis point change in rates june  net portfolio value ratio june  net portfolio value ratio base the change in the npv ratio is a long term measure of what might happen to the market value of financial assets and liabilities over time if interest rates changed instantaneously and the company did not change existing strategies 
the actual results could be better or worse based on changes in interest rate risk strategies 
the above results at june  indicate that the company would increase npv if interest rates rise and would decrease npv if interest rates fell 
in addition  the npv projections indicate that the company has experienced a decrease in its exposure to rising interest rates and a decrease in its potential benefit from falling interest rates at june  compared to june  based on the current federal funds rate at a range from zero to basis points  a basis point or more decrease in rates is highly unlikely 
the npv ratio for no change in rates has decreased basis points at june  compared to june  this model indicates theoretical results given various changes in the level of interest rates but no change in the shape of the yield curve 
the company also has exposure to changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the results of the projections are within parameters established by the board of directors 

table of contents in addition to the risk of changes in net interest income  the company is exposed to interest rate risk related to loans held for sale and loan commitments 
this is the risk that occurs when changes in interest rates will reduce gains or result in losses on the sale of residential mortgage loans that the company has committed to originate but has not yet contracted to sell 
the company hedges this risk by executing commitments to sell loans or mortgage backed securities based on the volume of committed loans that are likely to close 
additionally  msrs act as a hedge against rising rates  as they becomes more valuable in a rising rate environment  offsetting the decline in the value of loan commitments or loans held for sale in a rising rate environment
