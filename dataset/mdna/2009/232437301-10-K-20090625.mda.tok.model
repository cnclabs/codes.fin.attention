table of contents overview cyanotech corporation s core competency is cultivating and processing microalgae into high value  high quality natural products for the human nutrition market 
our products are sold in bulk quantities to manufacturers  formulators and distributors in the health foods and nutritional supplements markets and as packaged consumer products to distributors  retailers and direct consumer sales 
the company manufactures its products in hawaii  but markets them worldwide  generating  and of its revenues outside of the united states for each of the years ended march   and  respectively 
competing in a global marketplace  the company is influenced by the general economic conditions of the countries in which its customers operate  including adherence to its customers local governmental regulations and requirements 
the company currently has no material foreign exchange exposure as all sales are in us currency 
the company reported a net income of  or 
per diluted share for fiscal compared to a net loss of  or 
per diluted share for fiscal year cash and cash equivalents at march  were  down  from a year ago 
working capital increased to  at march  from working capital of  a year ago  primarily due to increased inventory balances 
the following table details selected financial data highlighting three key areas year ended march  in thousands net sales spirulina products natural astaxanthin products other products gross profit as a percentage of sales operating expenses as a percentage of sales net sales for fiscal were  or higher than the  reported for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due primarily to increased production of both astaxanthin and spirulina compared to astaxanthin production during fiscal was used entirely to produce higher value and higher margin bioastin nutrition products  compared to fiscal year which saw the shift away from the naturose animal product which was ultimately discontinued in march the company s emphasis is on growing the market for its health and nutritional products  bioastin and spirulina pacifica  as well as an expanded line of supplements and vitamins based on these products 
the company intends to grow its spirulina business by focusing on the higher nutritional content of its hawaiian spirulina and its superior service to its customers 
the company will emphasize the benefits of its natural astaxanthin products as increased competition from other producers of natural  and synthetic astaxanthin may result in the decline of margins generated by its natural astaxanthin products 
management cannot predict whether the outcomes of any of its strategies will be successful 
as depicted in the preceding table  the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to for the fiscal year ended march   up from for fiscal and for fiscal fiscal year margins increased as a result of stabilized production levels and strategic price increases instituted thoughout the year 
several factors impacted gross profit in prior fiscal years  such as below normal capacity production due to both customary and complex variables related to astaxanthin production in and spirulina production in the third quarter of other factors combining to 
table of contents impact prior years gross margins were customer and product mix  increased price competition  increases in raw materials costs and increased energy costs 
spirulina production recovered from the environmental problems experienced in fiscal year and described in prior years form k  as did astaxanthin production  which was impaired in fiscal year spirulina and astaxanthin production is anticipated to remain at levels which result in lower per unit production costs 
however  because complex biological processes are involved and these processes are influenced by factors beyond company control the weather  for example we cannot assure the results of any of the company s corrective or improvement efforts 
because the company s processes are agricultural  it is important to maintain reasonably strong production volumes in order to support the basic resource levels required to sustain a large scale  open culture  natural agricultural facility 
the company expects its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal to remain comparable to fiscal in both gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
however  operating expenses may increase as a result of the company s efforts to stabilize production  improve processes  introduce new products and expand its business 
specific level of income and expense can not be determined with certainty 
the company will continue to contain discretionary spending  and is actively pursuing methods of improving productivity  controlling energy  water and freight costs 
in fiscal year  the company recorded a non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements of million as a result of the analysis required under sfas no 
due to a history of losses  the company assessed the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
as of march  and however  no additional non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements was necessary for and to offset increased production costs  the company continues to strive to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
results of operations revenues net sales for fiscal totaled  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal and a increase from net sales of  reported in fiscal the following is a discussion of revenues by major product category 
spirulina the company has been producing spirulina pacifica  a strain of spirulina microalgae  since revenues generated from the company s spirulina products are a significant portion of total revenues  amounting to   and  for the years ended march   and respectively 
spirulina revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the three years ended march   is  and  respectively 
approximately  or of net sales for the year ended march  were to a spirulina marketing and distribution company based in the netherlands 
sales to this customer during fiscal years and amounted to  or of net sales  and  or of net sales 
in recent years  the company has experienced increased competition for its spirulina products resulting from an increasing number of suppliers of spirulina as well as from a larger portion of our sales coming from bulk product orders whose customers generally treat these products as commodities with price being the major determining factor driving their purchasing decision 
we expect this competitive pricing pressure to continue in future periods and in response have focused on improving the quality of our spirulina products in support of customers who demand higher quality raw materials for their formulations 
fiscal spirulina sales increased  or  a result of more units sold and increase in average selling price as compared to in fiscal  sales decreased from 
table of contents resulting from fewer units sold as a result of third quarter production issues 
as of march   there was no backlog of orders for spirulina products 
backlogs at the end of fiscal and were  and  respectively 
natural astaxanthin in fiscal  the company s sales of its natural astaxanthin products were  an increase of from  in fiscal  and an increase of from  in fiscal the increase in natural astaxanthin sales for was the result of a increase in units sold 
increased production in accounted for the sales improvement from a single customer accounted for  or of net sales for the year ended march  we believe that sales to this customer will continue to represent a significant portion of total net sales in future periods 
during  the company discontinued production of its animal product  naturose  in order to focus on the human astaxanthin products which are experiencing greater demand and have higher gross margins 
as of march   there was no backlog of orders for natural astaxanthin products 
backlog at the end of fiscal and was  and  respectively 
the decline in order backlog from year to year is the result of increased production allowing for timely order fulfillment 
the company believes that the findings of clinical trials undertaken in prior years by the company  its customers and other unaffiliated parties  taken individually and on a cumulative basis  have generated growing consumer awareness of the beneficial antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties of astaxanthin 
validation of natural astaxanthin benefits identified in such scientific studies has helped to spur demand for our natural astaxanthin products in the human nutrition market and could provide the basis for proprietary intellectual property 
the company completed and issued reports on two positive scientific clinical trials on natural astaxanthin during fiscal one study demonstrated that natural astaxanthin could lower levels of c reactive protein  an indicator of systemic inflammation and the second study showed that grip strength could be increased in those suffering from tennis elbow by consumption of natural astaxanthin 
the company plans to continue expenditures on targeted scientific trials in the future in accordance with its strategy to increase sales of natural astaxanthin products 
cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was at  and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
cost of sales includes the cost of nutrients and materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs  depreciation and amortization of production equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements associated with the production of inventory units sold  and other production related period costs 
the cost of sales as a percent of sales decrease of points between and  and points between and  is the result of improved control of customary and complex production variables related to astaxanthin and spirulina production 
customary variables include availability and costs of personnel  raw materials  energy and freight 
these variables fluctuate based on changes in the local  national and world economies 
complex variables include cultivation methods  feeding formulations and harvesting processes  all of which include efforts to anticipate the extent of weather and environmental events and make timely and sufficient adjustments 
although the variability of such costs can not be fully anticipated  the company has focused increased effort in this area in order to produce both spirulina and astaxanthin at levels sufficient to fully absorb production costs into inventory 
see discussion of sfas no 
below because the company s processes are agricultural  it is important to maintain production volumes in order to support the minimal resource levels required to sustain a large scale open culture agricultural facility 
the company expensed  of non inventoriable costs in fiscal year in fiscal   of non inventoriable costs were deemed to be period costs resulting from an abnormal usage of chemical  labor and utilities expended to manage the spirulina production problems  re inoculation and subsequent flooding which occurred in december these expenditures combined to significantly increase cost of sales relative to units produced and correspondingly reduced gross profit for the year ended march  fiscal year included  of non inventoriable costs as a result of abnormal chemical  labor and utility usage related to astaxanthin production coupled with costs associated with the company s animal nutrition market products which were not inventoriable because 
table of contents such costs would have exceeded the market value for the related inventory 
on march   the company announced its decision to abandon the animal nutrition market in favor of human products with higher demand and margins 
fresh water is critical for our natural astaxanthin production and  while the company has not experienced any constraint on fresh water availability  future availability could be negatively impacted by significant growth in the local population as well as by throughput constraints on the water delivery infrastructure owned by the county of hawaii 
given the criticality of fresh water to our operations and the community  the company recycles fresh water where possible and developed additional water recycling systems during fiscal in its efforts to utilize fresh water efficiently 
both fresh and sea water require electricity for pumping  and electricity  the company s single largest expenditure  depends on the cost of fuel oil which is  in turn  tied to the global price of crude oil 
the general price of fuel in hawaii has increased in excess of since the end of fiscal and the company s cost of electricity has increased per kilowatt hour 
for fiscal  the company expects to incur higher electric  water and shipping costs due to the impact of fuel cost increases experienced in fiscal and considering the likelihood of continued volatility in fuel cost in the future 
for the production of bioastin  the company s natural astaxanthin product for the human nutrition market  two third party contractors are utilized for the processes of extraction  and several third party contractors are utilized for both encapsulation for gelcaps and micro encapsulation for beadlets 
although these services are available from a limited number of sources  we believe we have the ability to use other parties if any of the current contractors become unavailable 
if pricing for any of these services significantly increases  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there have not been any significant changes in the cost of extraction or encapsulation services and none are currently anticipated 
to offset increased production costs  the company seeks ways to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency  and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective april  the provisions of sfas no 
inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter require that abnormal amounts of freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage be recognized as current period charges and fixed production overhead costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
normal capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances  taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance 
these amounts were   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
unforeseen changes in any of the factors surrounding the estimates imbedded in the determination of inventory values and cost of sales could have a material impact on cost of sales 
such changes in factors and estimates include but are not limited to production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  and changes in processing or production methods 
gross profit margin the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased points to for the fiscal year ended march   up from for fiscal the improvement is the result of increased sales volume driven by product availability and quality  price increases instituted throughout and increases in units produced resulting in lower unit costs 
the increase of percentage points in fiscal over was primarily the result of lower period costs resulting from production levels below normal capacity as previously explained 

table of contents management expects the company s fiscal gross profit margin percentage to remain generally consistent with the results reported for fiscal however  as discussed elsewhere in this annual report  the company cannot predict future production levels 
producing the highest quality microalgae is a complex biological process which requires the tenuous balancing of numerous factors including microalgal strain variations  temperature  acidity  nutrient and other environmental considerations  some of which are not in the company s control 
as a result  it can be difficult and time consuming to adjust  improve or correct production process when quality levels fall below specifications 
while the company generally possesses scientific knowledge and resources to correct its production processes  there are too many variables involved for the company to make reliable projections concerning such efforts 
however  we constantly strive to anticipate events requiring adjustments to nutrients  processes  customer demands  etc 
and strive to achieve increased production yields and improve quality 
in addition to the items discussed above  there are many factors which could materially diminish gross profit 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal total operating expense increased by  or over levels 
the decrease in from as a percentage of sales was primarily due to factors occurring in a non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements of million as a result of an analysis required under sfas no 
 expenses in conjunction with the restatement and amendment of a prior period annual report on form k  and costs incurred to meet listing requirements with nasdaq capital market including a one for four reverse stock split  all discussed in detail in prior forms k 
research and development costs increased to  in  up from  in fiscal  and approximately equal to the  in fiscal during fiscal year personnel were redirected to assist with urgent production issues accounting for the decrease in research and development expense from to in fiscal these resources returned their focus on identifying potential areas to improve cultivation and production processes therefore expense increased from the company benefited from these efforts in fiscal and they will continue in no new clinical trials were conducted in and however  the company expects to sponsor clinical studies in fiscal year in order to expand the applications of its health products 
sales and marketing costs were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  decreasing in from fiscal and increasing in from fiscal the decrease in from is due to the cessation of advertising programs and selling promotions eliminated with efforts to control expenses in the latter part of fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to was due to inflationary increases 
the company anticipates resuming selected advertising and promotional programs in fiscal in order to maintain and expand sales levels 
general and administrative expenses were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased from due to increased salaries and benefits from the addition of a new chief executive officer  an accountant to improve internal controls  and salary and benefits increases 
general and administrative expense in increased less than over as a result of a workforce reduction which occurred in december  to balance costs with sales and production environment occurring at the time 
current staffing has returned to the pre workforce reduction levels in order maintain adequate administration and financial accounting 
the company is committed to ongoing cost containment aimed at controlling its level of operating expenses  but may increase some discretionary spending in future periods as dictated by the needs of the business 
the company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
this analysis under sfas no 
at march  
table of contents determined that the company s equipment and leasehold improvements are not impaired in cyanotech s consolidated balance sheet at march  however  such analysis under sfas no 
at march  had determined that the company should record a non cash impairment loss reducing  by million  the values of certain production related equipment and leasehold improvement assets 
accordingly  the values of the company s equipment and leasehold improvement assets as reported on the consolidated balance sheets as of march  were reduced by the impairment loss  and the company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended march  includes the corresponding charge of million for the impairment of equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company notes that the foregoing reduction of asset carrying values significantly and correspondingly reduced depreciation expense in future periods 
the company expects fiscal operating expense spending will remain consistent with or increase from fiscal due to increased personnel costs  inflationary increases of expenses and the resumption of selected advertising and research activities as previously discussed 
the company will continue to leverage customer supported research where and as practicable 
increases in sales and marketing expenses may become necessary as the company seeks new and increased markets and market share 
also  the cost of regulatory compliance including international standards iso  us food and drug manufacturing practice gmp  securities and exchange commission requirements including sarbanes oxley  nasdaq capital market listing requirements and other regulatory compliance areas continue to increase 
the company will be required under sarbanes oxley to have an independent audit of the company s internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year ending march  this will be an expense not currently incurred by the company 
finally  the company must remain competitive in the labor market  and this may lead to some increases in general and administrative costs 
other expense the following details the amounts included in other expense in thousands interest expense on term loan agreement other interest expense other income expense  net total other expense the total principal balance on the company s term loans was   and  as of march   and  respectively 
the interest rate under the term loans is above the prime rate 
the prime rate as of march   and was  and  respectively 
interest expense includes amortization of debt issue costs 
other income expense  net represents interest earned on certain cash and cash equivalents balances 
fiscal also includes state sales tax expense related to prior years 
fiscal and also included gains losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions of the company s japan subsidiary which was discontinued in income taxes for fiscal the company recorded income tax expense of  compared with an income tax expense of  for and a benefit of  for the tax benefit amounts were anticipated hawaii state tax credits which were ultimately disallowed in fiscal at march  the company had federal and hawaii state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
these net operating loss benefits have been fully reserved as their utilization is not assured 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources financial condition at march   the company s working capital was  an increase of  compared to  at march  cash and cash equivalents at march  totaled  a decrease of  from  at march  the increase in working capital is mainly due to an increase in inventories from the prior year 
good production levels throughout fiscal have allowed the company to build sufficient inventory to meet the needs of our customers on a timely basis 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is due to cash used in operating activities  primarily resulting from increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses previously discussed 
the company has two term loan agreements term loans with a lender 
these provided up to million in combined credit facilities which are secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
the outstanding combined balance under the term loans as of march  is approximately  the term loans have maturity dates of may  as to  and march  as to  and are payable in equal monthly principal and interest payments of approximately  the interest rate under the term loans  in absence of a default under the agreement  is the prime rate in effect as of the close of business on the first day of each calendar quarter  plus 
the prime rate was at march  the company is prohibited by the term loan from declaring any cash dividends without the lender s prior written consent 
a  restricted cash deposit is held in an interest bearing restricted cash account per the terms of the term loan and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets at march  and the following table presents the company s debt and lease obligations at march  in thousands less than year years years after years total term loans interest expense on term loan operating leases total includes a term loan totaling  for farm equipment purchased march  interest on bridgeview loans is computed using the rate in effect at april  of 
on april   the company entered into an agreement with first hawaiian bank for a line of credit in the amount of  for a term of one year 
the obligation is secured by the company s us accounts receivable and bears a variable interest rate based on prime plus 
there is no outstanding balance as of june  cash flows our cash and cash equivalents were   and  at march   and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the company generated cash from operating activities of  compared to cash used in operations for fiscal of  and  in fiscal the improved cash provided by operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to the fiscal net income of  non cash expenses totaling  and timing differences in current payables and receivables  offset by increased inventory balances of  the additional cash used in operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to the fiscal net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal year which included non cash expenses of  coupled with the impact of increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets in 
table of contents amounting to  depreciation and amortization expense was   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
depreciation expense for and was significantly less than as a result of the non cash impairment write down of production equipment and leasehold improvements in net cash of  was used in investing activities during fiscal this compared to net cash used in investing activities in of  such equipment purchases continue to be aimed toward capital projects enhancing or maintaining our ability to respond to market demand 
management expects to continue to invest in equipment upgrades and leasehold improvements tied to market requirements and production efficiency 
capital expenditures are expected to be level or increase as compared to amounts expended in fiscal during fiscal  cash used in financing activities was  representing principal payments on long term debt 
during fiscal  cash obtained from financing activities amounted to  the proceeds of senior debt 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal was  in principal payments on long term debt and  of closing costs related to the senior debt 
sufficiency of liquidity based upon our current operating plan  analysis of our consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations  we believe that our operating cash flows and expected cash balances will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements  debt service  and planned capital expenditures  for the next months 
with total working capital of million  and a current ratio of to as of march   management expects liquidity in fiscal to be generated primarily from operating cash flows 
unexpected capital expenditures or business expansion could require the company to identify additional debt or equity funding sources 
the company has used estimates of future financial results including projected revenue  expenses  borrowings  and capital expenditures in reaching its conclusions 
such estimates are subject to change based on future results and such change could cause future results to vary significantly from expected results presented in this form k 
the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to fluctuate materially as it has in the past 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes to our largest customers  weather patterns  increased competition  increased materials  nutrient and energy costs  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  governmental regulations and other factors beyond our control 
in addition  the company maintains product liability insurance only in limited amounts for products involving human consumption because broader product liability coverage is cost prohibitive 
a significant portion of our expense levels are relatively fixed  so the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on forecasts of future sales 
if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
we may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations 
effect of recently issued accounting standards and estimates in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands the disclosures on fair measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
sfas no 
also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of 
table of contents observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are either directly or indirectly observable  level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing 
sfas no 
is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning april   except for non financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis  for which the effective date is fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position for sfas no 
fsp fas to amend sfas no 
to exclude sfas no  accounting for leases  and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under sfas no 
however  this scope exception does not apply to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that are required to be measured at fair value under sfas no 
 business combinations  or sfas no 
r  business combinations as discussed in more detail below  regardless of whether those assets and liabilities are related to leases 
additionally  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position for sfas no 
fsp fas  which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity s financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually until fiscal years beginning after november  also  in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position for sfas no 
fsp fas  which clarifies the application of sfas no 
in a market that is not active 
the company will adopt sfas no 
for non financial assets that are recognized or disclosed on a non recurring basis on april  and the management is currently evaluating the effect  if any  on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair market value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning april  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management regularly re evaluates its judgments and estimates which are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes that of its significant accounting policies  policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are inventory valuations  valuation of equipment and leasehold improvements and long lived assets  and income taxes 
the company records inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is defined as the sum of the applicable expenditures and charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventories to their existing 
table of contents condition and location 
cost for inventory purposes may be determined under any one of several assumptions as to the flow of cost factors  such as first in  first out  average cost  and last in  first out 
our inventories are stated using the first in  first out method 
inventory values are subject to many critical estimates  and unforeseen changes in any of the factors surrounding the estimates imbedded in the determination of inventory values and cost of sales could have a material impact on the company s results 
such changes in factors and estimates include but are not limited to production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  changes in processing or production methods  and changes in the carrying value of our inventories resulting from the prices our customers are willing to pay for our products 
such estimates are revised on a quarterly based on information available at that time 
based on our analysis of inventory turnover  a reserve for inventory was not deemed necessary 
equipment and leasehold improvements are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
self constructed leasehold improvements include design  construction and supervision costs 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to equipment and leasehold improvements when construction is completed and the facilities are placed in service 
if the company experiences impairment to its equipment or leasehold improvement  we account for the impairment in accordance with sfas no 
pursuant to sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
during the year ended march   the company recorded an impairment charge of  the company determined fair value based upon present values of expected future cash flows 
this technique requires the use of a variety of estimates including projected financial information  discount rates  as well as estimates of asset values many years in the future 
as such  the results from the use of this method can result in significant volatility should any of these estimates or assumptions change 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
judgment is required in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
should the company generate sustained taxable income in the future  management may conclude that a portion or all of the existing valuation allowance is no longer required 
due to the company s history of losses  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against net deferred tax assets 
management has assessed the impact of uncertain tax positions to be immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into any transactions using derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and believe that our exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments is not material 
we have two term loans which adjust quarterly based on the prime rate 
as such  we are exposed to the interest rate risk whereby a increase in the prime rate would lead to an increase of approximately  in interest expense for the year ending march  based on march  amounts outstanding
