the advertising environment for lagged behind the rab has reported that trends in radio advertising revenue mirrored fluctuations in the current economic environment yielding mixed results over the last three years 
in  advertising revenues decreased  after decreasing in and increasing only in our political revenues increased by million compared to due to being a presidential election year 
we recorded total impairment charges of million in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill 
the impairment loss in connection with our review of broadcasting licenses and goodwill during the fourth quarter of see note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements  was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used  a decrease in station transaction multiples  and a decrease in advertising revenue growth projections for the broadcasting industry 
our management team remains focused on our strategy of pursuing growth through acquisition 
however  acquisitions are closely evaluated to ensure that they will generate stockholder value and our management is committed to completing only those acquisitions that we believe will increase our share price 
the compression of publicly traded radio broadcast company multiples since  combined with a market for privately held radio stations that did not see a corresponding multiples compression  translated to minimal acquisition activity for us in in furtherance of this strategy  in  our board terminated the and repurchase programs and authorized a new program to purchase from time to time  up to million of our class a common stock  subject to the terms of our credit agreement and compliance with other applicable legal requirements 
through december  we have purchased million shares of our class a common stock in the open market for cash at an average repurchase price per share of 
in june  the company entered into an amendment to its existing credit agreement  dated june   by and among the company  bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and the lenders party thereto 
the credit agreement  as amended  is referred to herein as the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement provides for a replacement term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million  which replaces the prior term loan facility that had an outstanding balance of approximately million at the time of refinancing  and maintains the pre existing million revolving credit facility 
as of december   the effective interest rate on the borrowings pursuant to the credit facility was approximately 
as of december   our average cost of debt  including the effects of our derivative positions  was 
we remain committed to maintaining manageable debt levels  which will continue to improve our ability to generate cash flow from operations 
our business we engage in the acquisition  operation  and development of commercial radio stations in mid size radio markets in the united states 
in addition  we  along with three private equity firms  formed cumulus media partners  llc cmp  which acquired the radio broadcasting business of susquehanna pfaltzgraff co 
susquehanna in may the acquisition included radio stations in markets 
as a result of our investment in 
table of contents cmp and the acquisition of susquehanna s radio operations  we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on number of stations and believe we are the third largest radio broadcasting company based on net revenues 
as of december   directly and through our investment in cmp  we owned or operated stations in us markets and provided sales and marketing services under local marketing  management and consulting agreements pending fcc approval of acquisition to one additional station 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements advertising revenue and station operating income our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by arbitron on a periodic basis  generally two or four times per year 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
trade revenue totaled million in  million in  and in our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
local advertising represented approximately of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in and our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the second and fourth calendar quarters will generally produce the highest revenues for the year  with the exception of certain of our stations  such as those in myrtle beach  south carolina  where the stations generally earn higher revenues in the second and third quarters of the year because of the higher seasonal population in those communities 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local market management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate station operating income

table of contents pro forma net revenues exclude the results of the stations contributed to cmp  for the period january through may  pro forma net revenues for the twelve months ended december  decreased by million to million  a decline from the same period in  due to a general decrease in sales across our station platform 
pro forma station operating income decreased from the same period in seasonality we expect that our operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of our cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations  expenses associated with our station and corporate operations  capital expenditures  repurchases of our class a common stock  and interest and debt service payments 
the following table summarizes our historical funding needs for the years ended december   and acquisitions and purchase of intangible assets capital expenditures repayments of bank borrowings repurchases of common stock interest payments in the short term  our principal future need for funds will include the funding of station operating expenses  corporate general and administrative expenses and interest and debt service payments 
in addition  in the long term  our funding needs will include future acquisitions and capital expenditures associated with maintaining our station and corporate operations and implementing hd radio tm technology 
in december  we purchased perpetual licenses from ibiquity  which will enable us to convert to and utilize ibiquity s hd radio tm technology on up to of our stations 
under the terms of our original agreement with ibiquity  we agreed to convert certain of our stations over a seven year period 
on march   we entered into an amendment to our agreement with ibiquity to reduce the number of planned conversions  extend the build out schedule  and increase the license fees to be paid for each converted station 
we anticipate that the average cost to convert each station will be between  and our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  demographics or  audience tastes  and fluctuations in preferred advertising media 
in addition  as discussed further below  borrowings under financing arrangements are subject to financial covenants that can restrict our financial flexibility 
in addition  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
management has taken steps to mitigate this risk through heightened collection efforts and enhancing our credit approval process 
further  our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing is also subject to market conditions and operating performance 
during the current recession affecting the global financial markets  some companies have experienced difficulties accessing their cash equivalents  trading investment securities  drawing revolvers  issuing debt and raising capital which has had a material adverse impact on their liquidity 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined  based on our financial condition as of december   that cash on hand and cash expected to be generated by financing activities and from operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  interest and debt service payments and potential acquisitions and repurchases of securities and other debt obligations for the next months 
however  given the uncertainty of the markets cash flows and the impact of the current recession on 
table of contents guarantors  there can be no assurance that cash generated from operations will be sufficient  or financing will be available at terms  and on the timetable  that may be necessary to meet our future capital needs 
consideration of recent economic developments and the outlook for as the capital and credit market crisis worsened during the fourth quarter of and into early  and in conjunction with the development of our business plan  we continue to assess the impact of recent market developments on a variety of areas  including our forecasted advertising revenues and liquidity 
for example  in november  moody s credit rating agency downgraded our debt rating from b to caa 
in response to these conditions  we refined our business plan to incorporate a reduction in our forecasted revenues and cost reductions implemented in fourth quarter and first quarter to mitigate the impact of cumulus anticipated decline in revenue 
while preparing our business plan  we assessed future covenant compliance under our credit agreement  including consideration of market uncertainties  as well as the incremental cost that would be required to potentially amend the terms of our credit agreement 
we believe we will continue to be in compliance with all of our debt covenants through at least december  based upon actions we have already taken  as well as through additional paydowns of debt estimated to be at least million we will be required to make during from existing cash balances and cash flow generated from operations 
further discussion of our debt covenant compliance considerations is included below 
the current economic crisis has reduced demand for advertising in general  including advertising on our radio stations 
if our revenues were to be significantly less than planned due to difficult market conditions or for other reasons  our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreements would become increasingly difficult without remedial measures  such as the implementation of further cost abatement initiatives 
if our remedial measures were not successful in maintaining covenant compliance  then we would negotiate with our lenders for relief  which relief could result in higher interest expense 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of our credit agreements and failure to negotiate relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all outstanding debt 
under these circumstances  the acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and  net cash provided by operating activities increased and decreased million and million  respectively 
excluding non cash items  we generated comparable levels of operating income for and as compared with the prior years 
as a result  the movement in cash flows from operations was primarily attributable to the timing of certain payments 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities decreased million  primarily due to a million decrease in capital expenditures as well as a decrease of million in proceeds from the sales of radio assets year over year 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the absence of acquisitions and the purchases of intangible assets  million of proceeds from the sale of assets and a million reduction of capital expenditures 

table of contents cash flows used in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities increased million  primarily due to repayment of borrowings under our credit facility 
for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities decreased million  due to a decrease in costs associated with share repurchases offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the refinancing as compared to the refinancing 
during  net cash used in financing activities increased million  primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock  offset by an increase in borrowings under a new credit facility primarily used to fund these repurchases 
completed acquisitions we did not complete any acquisitions during pending acquisitions 
as of december   we had pending a swap transaction pursuant to which we would exchange one of our fort walton beach  florida radio stations  wyzb fm  for another owned by star broadcasting  inc  wtke fm 
specifically  the purchase agreement provided for the exchange of wyzb fm plus million in cash for wtke fm 
following the filing of the assignment applications with the fcc  the applications were challenged by qantum communications  who has some radio stations in the market and complained to the fcc that the swap would give us an unfair competitive advantage because the station we would acquire reaches more people than the station we would be giving up 
qantum also initiated litigation in the united states district court for the southern district of florida against the current owner of wtke fm  and secured a court decision that would require the sale of the station to qantum instead of us

the transaction also contemplates that we would enter into a long term lma to operate the green bay stations after they are acquired by clear channel 
lmas are deemed to be attributable ownership interests under fcc rules and  to comply with ownership limitations under fcc rules  we will place two stations wznn fm in allouez  wisconsin  and wwwx fm in oshkosh  wisconsin in a trust that will be obligated to sell the stations pursuant to parameters established in the trust agreement with us 
the transaction documents also include a put agreement that entitles clear channel to require us to purchase the green bay stations in assuming that acquisition would comply with fcc ownership rules 
the requisite assignment applications have been filed with the fcc  and the transaction could close in the first or second quarter of as of december   we had pending a swap transaction pursuant to which we would exchange wzbn fm  camilla  ga  for wbc  a translator licensed for use in atlanta  georgia  owned by extreme media group

in connection with the new credit facility  we capitalized approximately million of debt issuance costs  which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  our management  in consultation with the audit committee of our board  evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience and trends 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectability 
all other balances are reviewed and evaluated on a pooled basis 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
although our management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have significant intangible assets recorded in our accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that the carrying value of our goodwill and certain intangible assets be reviewed at least annually for impairment and charged to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of those assets is more than their fair market value 
during   and  we recorded impairment charges of approximately   and million  respectively in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
as of december   we have million in intangible assets and goodwill  which represent approximately of our total assets 
the fair market value of our broadcast licenses and reporting units  for purposes of our annual impairment tests  by relying on a discounted cash flow approach assuming a start up scenario in which the only assets held by an investor are broadcasting licenses 
the fair value contains assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance using industry normalized information for an average station within a market 
these variables would include  but not be limited to the forecast growth rate of each 
table of contents radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and terminal values 
the impairment loss in connection with our review of broadcasting licenses and goodwill during the fourth quarter of see note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements  was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used  a decrease in station transaction multiples  and a decrease in advertising revenue growth projections for the broadcasting industry 
in connection with the elimination of amortization of broadcast licenses upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within our net operating loss carry forward period 
we have established a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will be realized 
should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r  share based payment  for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively  before income taxes 
upon adopting sfas no 
r  for awards with service conditions  a one time election was made to recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for options with service conditions only  we utilized the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of options issued 
for restricted stock awards with service conditions  we utilized the intrinsic value method 
for restricted stock awards with performance conditions  we have evaluated the probability of vesting of the awards at each reporting period and have adjusted compensation cost based on this assessment 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than to to after contractual cash obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases digital radio capital obligations other operating contracts total contractual cash obligations under our credit agreement  the maturity of our outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants 
based on long term debt amounts outstanding at december   scheduled annual principal amortization and the current effective interest rate on such long term debt amounts outstanding  we would be obligated to pay approximately million of interest on borrowings through june million due in less than one  year  million due in years two and three  million due in years four and five  and million due after five years 
amount represents the estimated capital requirements to convert of our stations to a digital broadcasting format in future periods

table of contents fsp fas the fasb issued this fsp in october and it is effective upon issuance including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
this fsp clarifies the application of sfas in an inactive market  including  how internal assumptions should be considered when measuring fair value  how observable market information in a market that is not active should be considered and how the use of market quotes should be used when assessing observable and unobservable data

the company will adopt this fsp as of january   but does not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  in may  we entered into a forward starting effective march libor based interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our current floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
this agreement is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
segregating the million of borrowings outstanding at december  that are not subject to the interest rate swap and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above  to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk none of our operations are measured in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results are not subject to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets
