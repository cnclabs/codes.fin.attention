acquisitions sturgis iron metal 
on june   we completed our acquisition of certain assets of sturgis iron metal  an operator of scrap collection and processing locations in indiana  michigan and georgia 
the assets were purchased for approximately million in cash through bankruptcy proceedings and are operated as a part of omnisource and reported in our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment 
we purchased the assets to continue our expansion of our metals recycling operations and have begun operating three of the ten acquired locations 
sturgis iron metal operations represented less than of segment total sales and gross margin during the period since its acquisition 
recycle south on june   we completed our acquisition of recycle south  one of the nation s largest  privately held  regional scrap metal recycling companies  headquartered in spartanburg  south carolina 
omnisource which already owned of recycle south  acquired the remaining equity interest for a purchase price of approximately million 
we paid approximately million in cash  including transaction costs  and issued  shares of steel dynamics  inc common stock valued at million 
in addition  we assumed million of net debt  of which approximately million was repaid upon the closing of the acquisition 
we purchased recycle south to expand our metals recycling business 
recycle south provides a significant presence in the southeastern united states through its locations within north carolina  south carolina and georgia 
recycle south s consolidated operating results have been reflected in our financial statements since june   in the metals recycling and ferrous resources reporting segment 
recycle south operations are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger  june   through december  the addition of recycle south added shipments of  tons of ferrous metals and million pounds of non ferrous materials to the metals recycling 
table of contents and ferrous resources segment during net sales during the period were million  or of the segment annual total  and gross margin was million  or of the segment annual total 
omnisource 
on october   we completed our acquisition of of the stock of omnisource  a privately owned ferrous and non ferrous scrap processing and trading company 
we paid approximately million in cash  including transaction costs  and issued million shares march two for one stock split adjusted of our common stock with a value of approximately million 
in addition  we assumed approximately million of debt  which we repaid on the closing of the acquisition 
we have in the past  and will continue in the future  to purchase a portion of our raw material needs for the steel operations segment from omnisource 
we purchased omnisource to significantly expand our strategic expansion into the steel scrap and recycled metals sector 
omnisource primarily procures and processes an array of ferrous and non ferrous scrap materials and also provides brokerage and materials management services for these materials 
aside from the fact that scrap is the single largest cost component for our steelmaking operations  the acquisition  along with the acquisition of recycle south  provides an entry for further profitable growth in a sector that is continuing to grow on a global basis 
omnisource employs approximately  people in facilities located in the eastern united states and canada 
omnisource operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of steel dynamics and continues to focus on the ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing  brokerage  and industrial scrap management needs of its customers 
omnisource operations are reported in our metals recycling and ferrous resources operating segment 
omnisource operating results are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger  october   through december  the techs 
on july   we purchased the techs for approximately million  which was funded from our existing senior secured revolving credit facility 
the techs is a pennsylvania based flat rolled steel galvanizing company  which consists of three non union galvanizing facilities galvtech  metaltech  and nextech 
each facility specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in non automotive applications  servicing a variety of customers in the hvac  commercial construction  and consumer goods markets 
about of the techs sales are to customers in the eastern us and the midwest 
we purchased the techs to expand our market share in the value added steel coating business 
with the addition of the techs  we have an annual estimated galvanizing capacity of approximately million tons 
the techs complements our three existing galvanizing lines located in butler  indiana and jeffersonville  indiana 
the purchase of the techs allows us to access markets that require widths or gauges that our existing facilities can not currently supply 
the techs operations are reflected in our steel operations segment 
the techs operating results are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger july   through december  income statement classifications net sales 
net sales from our operations are a factor of net tons shipped  product mix and related pricing 
we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel  product dimensions  certain smaller volumes  and for value added processing or coating of the steel products 
except for our steel fabrication operations segment  we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
net sales from steel fabrication are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentage of completion method  which is based on the percentage of steel consumed to date as compared to the estimated total steel required for each contract 
costs of goods sold 
our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
the principal elements of these costs for our steel operations are steel scrap and scrap substitutes  alloys  zinc  natural gas  argon  direct and indirect labor and related 
table of contents benefits  electricity  oxygen  electrodes  depreciation  materials and freight 
our metallic raw materials  steel scrap and scrap substitutes  represent the most significant single component of our costs of goods sold 
the primary costs related to our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations is the cost of raw materials  freight costs  and processing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales  finance and accounting  and administrative departments 
these costs include  among other items  labor and benefits  professional services  insurance expense  property taxes  profit sharing  and amortization of intangible assets 
interest expense  net capitalized interest 
interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt described in the notes to our financial statements net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of material capital projects 
other income expense 
other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other non operating income activity  including gains on certain short term investments and income from equity investments 
other expense consists of any non operating costs 
operating results vs 
net income was million or per diluted share during  compared with million or per diluted share during our gross margin percentage was and during and  respectively 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage during was due primarily to the inclusion of the techs and omnisource in our financial results  as well as recycle south during the second half of the year 
although the techs generally elicits higher selling values due to value added products  the gross margin for the galvanized steels produced by the techs is lower than that of our other galvanizing lines due to the incremental cost of purchasing a steel coil to be coated versus producing that coil at cost  as we do at our flat roll division 
omnisource and recycle south are primarily engaged in the collection and processing of ferrous and non ferrous materials for resale to steel producers  brokers  and other processors 
this type of business operates at lower margins than we have historically experienced as a steel producer 
gross profit 
during  our net sales increased billion  or  to billion 
while shipping volumes increased modestly during in our steel operations and steel fabrication operating segments due to the full year inclusion of the techs acquisition in  our metals recycling and ferrous resources operating segment experienced a significant increase in volumes compared to because of the full year inclusion of omnisource operations  as well as the acquisition of recycle south in june steel operations twelve months ended december  shipments net tons flat roll division structural and rail division engineered bar products division roanoke bar division steel of west virginia the techs total shipments intra company external shipments 
table of contents steel operations accounted for   and of our consolidated net sales and   and of our consolidated gross margin during   and  respectively 
our flat roll division decreased shipments by  tons  or  and our structural and rail division decreased shipments by  tons  or 
these divisions were negatively impacted in the late third quarter and fourth quarter of by the weak economy and dramatic decrease in steel scrap prices 
our engineered bar products division increased shipments by  tons  or  during this period as a result of increased demand for special bar quality products and the continued development of longer term customer supply relationships 
in our roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia shipped  tons and  tons  respectively  compared to  tons and  tons  respectively  during the techs operations increased shipments by  tons due to the inclusion of a full year of operations during average quarterly steel selling prices graphic our average steel operations selling price per ton shipped increased compared with during strong demand for our steel products during the first half of the year allowed us to increase our annual average selling price by more than 
however  throughout the late third quarter and fourth quarter of  demand and selling prices for our steel products fell dramatically due to the weakening of the economy and a swift decline in steel scrap costs 
we currently anticipate a substantial decrease in our steel operations average pricing in compared to due to the continued weak economy and demand for our steel products 
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost 
our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased during as compared to during and our metallic raw material costs represented and of our steel operation s manufacturing costs  excluding the operations of the techs  which purchases  rather than produces  the steel it further processes 
during the fourth quarter of  our steel operations costs of goods sold included approximately million in increased costs in order to value our inventories at market value  which was below our cost 
we anticipate steel scrap prices to remain relatively low during which  when combined with the revaluation of our inventories at the end of and the consumption of previously purchased higher priced steel scrap  should result in a lower cost posture entering 
table of contents steel fabrication operations steel fabrication operations accounted for  and of our consolidated net sales and  and of our consolidated gross margin during   and  respectively 
our average steel fabrication operations selling price per ton shipped increased  or less than  during when compared with the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations 
during and  respectively  the cost of steel products purchased represented and of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations 
the weak economy and decreased activity in non residential construction had a negative impact on this operating segment during the latter half of we anticipate non residential construction to remain slow during  resulting in decreased shipping volumes and selling prices for this segment of our operations compared to average quarterly fabrication selling prices graphic metals recycling and ferrous resources operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations accounted for and of our consolidated net sales and and of our consolidated gross margin during and  respectively 
our metals recycling operations primarily engage in the brokerage  collection and processing of ferrous and non ferrous metals for resale to steel companies  brokers and other metals processors 
we acquired omnisource in october and recycle south in june  therefore  our segment results are significantly higher than our results for during  this segment recorded shipments of million tons of ferrous metals and million pounds of non ferrous materials 
in addition  tons of scrap substitute materials were shipped to  and consumed by  our steel operations segment 
the results of the metals recycling and ferrous resources operations include the consolidated results of recycle south beginning june  and omnisource beginning october  elevated global demand for commodity products  including ferrous and non ferrous materials  in addition to decreased availability of domestic ferrous materials due to the decrease in industrial generation of ferrous scrap  drove a tightening of availability and unprecedented cost increases for 
table of contents ferrous materials during the first half of however  global demand precipitated a sharp decline in ferrous and non ferrous material costs at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  our metals recycling operations costs of goods sold included approximately million in increased costs due to reduction in inventory values that were recorded at a cost level which was higher than current market values 
we anticipate ferrous and non ferrous material costs will most likely remain relatively stable during consolidated results vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization expenses were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
our selling  general and administrative expenses represented of our total net sales during both and we recorded expense of million and million during and  respectively  related to our steel dynamics performance based profit sharing plan allocation 
during the company s board of directors modified the contribution percentage for this plan to consist of of consolidated pretax earnings plus a unique percentage of each of the company s operating segments pretax earnings 
the resulting total contribution percentage was of consolidated pretax earnings during the plan allocation was calculated on of pretax earnings during during and  respectively  we recorded additional profit sharing expense of million and million  related to certain subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan 
amortization expense increased million  or  during compared to this increase reflects the addition of finite lived intangible assets related to the acquisitions of omnisource and recycle south in october and june  respectively 
the recycle south valuation of finite lived intangibles is still preliminary  which could cause a change in the amount of amortization on a go forward basis 
interest expense  net capitalized interest 
during  gross interest expense increased million  or  to million and capitalized interest increased million to million  when compared to this increase in interest expense was due to increased debt levels of million 
the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our various operating segments 
we currently anticipate gross interest expense to remain somewhat comparable for other income  net other expense 
other income was million during  as compared to other expense of million during during  other income of million was attributable to earnings from investments in scrap procurement and processing entities which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
as of the date of its acquisition  recycle south  which was million of other income during  is no longer included in these earnings  as its results are consolidated in our financial statements after acquisition 
in addition  we also realized gains on sales of marketable securities during of million 
during  other income was offset by million of expense related to the call premium associated with the redemption of our notes and the termination of a related fixed to floating interest rate swap which resulted in a million loss on hedging activities income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during our effective income tax rate was and during and  respectively 
we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial 
table of contents statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december  are potential benefits of million that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net of tax basis in income tax expense 
during  we recognized interest of  net of tax  and penalties of  at december   we had million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions 
the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for through in the third quarter of the final examination adjustments did not result in a material change to the company s financial position or results of operations 
the state of indiana completed its examination of the calendar years through in the third quarter of the total tax paid to settle the examinations was million 
this amount was included in the balance of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded when we adopted fin on january  it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of state income tax audits 
based on the current audits in process  the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to million by the end of  primarily related to state nexus issues 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to federal  state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before consolidated results vs 
net income was million or per diluted share during  compared with million or per diluted share during our gross margin percentage was and during and  respectively 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage during was due to several factors  primarily weaker flat roll steel markets and the acquisition of the techs and omnisource 
although the techs generally elicits higher selling values due to value added products  the gross margin for the galvanized steels produced by the techs is lower than that of our other galvanizing lines due to the incremental cost of purchasing a steel coil to be coated versus producing that coil at cost  as we do at our flat roll division

this type of business operates at lower margins than we have historically experienced as a steel producer 
gross profit 
during  our net sales increased billion  or  to billion  while our consolidated shipments increased million tons  or  to million tons  when compared with the increase in shipments was due to increased shipments at several of our steelmaking operations and to shipments from our acquired operations the techs and omnisource 
our flat roll division decreased shipments by  tons  or 
our structural and rail division increased shipments by  tons  or  which resulted from increased demand for structural products for the non residential construction industry 
our engineered bar products division increased shipments by  tons  or  during this period as a result of increased demand for special bar quality products and the continued development of longer term customer supply relationships 
in our roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia shipped  tons and  tons  respectively  for the full year compared to  tons and  tons  respectively  for the period april  to december  our average steel operations selling price per ton shipped increased compared with during strong demand for structural steel products allowed us to increase our annual 
table of contents average selling price by more than  while the inverse was true for our flat roll products 
due to weaker demand during and the overhang of inventories from the impact of lower priced inventory during the third and fourth quarters of  our annual average selling price for flat roll products decreased by more than 
however  throughout the second half of  steel service center inventories continued to decline and were at a two year low by the end of the year 
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost 
our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased during as compared to during and our metallic raw material costs represented and of our steel operation s manufacturing costs and and of our total consolidated manufacturing costs 
during april  we purchased three additional joist manufacturing facilities which were included in the operations of our steel fabrication segment 
our average steel fabrication operations selling price per ton shipped increased  or  during when compared with the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our fabrication operations 
during and  respectively  the cost of steel products purchased represented and of the total cost of manufacturing for our fabrication operations

during and  respectively  we recorded additional profit sharing expense of million and million  related to certain subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan 
our board of directors approved an increase from to in the profit sharing rate effective august   in recognition of the additional plan participants added as a result of acquisition activity 
interest expense  net capitalized interest 
during  gross interest expense increased million  or  to million and capitalized interest increased million to million  when compared to the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our steel operations and steel fabrication operations 
during  interest expense was also reduced by million related to the recognition of the remaining unamortized bond premium associated with the redemption of our notes 
other income  net other expense 
other expense was million during  as compared to other income of million during during  other expense was principally comprised of million of additional expense related to the call premium associated with the redemption of our notes and the termination of a related fixed to floating interest rate swap which resulted in a million loss on hedging activities 
these expenses were partially offset by interest income  certain non operating revenues  and income from certain equity investments 
during  other income was principally comprised of certain non operating revenues recognized at several of the roanoke electric subsidiaries

deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity  long term borrowings  state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 
working capital 
during  our operational working capital position  representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals decreased million to million compared to december  trade receivables decreased million  or  during to million  of which more than were current or less than days past due 
our largest customer is an affiliated company  heidtman steel  which represented and of our outstanding trade receivables at december  and  respectively 
trade receivables declined substantially during the fourth quarter of due to a sharp decrease in shipping volumes and product prices 
the dollar value of our raw materials  primarily steel scrap inventories  increased by approximately million during the year  conversely  the value of our finished goods inventories decreased by approximately million over the same period 
during our total inventories increased million  or  to billion 
of this increase in total inventories  million was the result of the acquisition of recycle south 
the remaining increase during the year was driven primarily by the significant increase in the cost and volume of our steel scrap inventories at december  our trade payables and general accruals decreased million  or  during this is a reflection of the slowdown in our production process during the fourth quarter of capital expenditures 
during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment  of which million related primarily to the addition of a second rolling mill and second caster at our structural and rail division  million related to omnisource operations and million related to construction at mesabi nugget  our planned iron nugget manufacturing facility 
the remaining capital expenditures primarily represented improvement projects at our other facilities 
we believe these capital investments will benefit our net sales and related cash flows as each project develops 
capital resources and long term debt 
during  our total outstanding debt increased million to billion 
our total long term debt to capitalization ratio  representing our long term debt  including current maturities divided by the sum of our long term debt and our total stockholders equity  was and at december  and  respectively 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under our million senior secured revolver and million outstanding under our term a loan both due july 
the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  enter into transactions with affiliates  make restricted payments or investments  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  pay dividends or distributions and enter into other 
table of contents specified transactions and activities 
our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement 
the financial covenants state that we must maintain at all times an interest coverage ratio of not less than and must maintain a total debt to consolidated last twelve months trailing ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and certain other non cash transaction adjustments as defined in the credit agreement ratio of not more than 
if the total debt to ebitda ratio exceeds  then our ability to make restricted payments as defined in the credit agreement which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases  among other things  is limited to million per quarter 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december   and believe we will remain in compliance during the next twelve months 
our interest coverage ratio was and our total debt to ebitda ratios was at december  during april  we issued million of senior notes due notes 
the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of recycle south as described in note during  holders of our convertible subordinated notes converted the remaining million of the notes to steel dynamics common stock  resulting in the issuance of million shares of our treasury stock 
common stock purchases 
during  we purchased million shares of our common stock in open market trades at an average purchase price of per share 
as of december   million shares remain authorized and available for purchase 
our board of directors authorized increases of million  million and million shares to our existing share repurchase program on july   august   and september   respectively 
cash dividends 
we declared cash dividends of million  or

our board of directors  along with executive management  approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis 
the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors  after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  outstanding indebtedness  current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans 
in addition  the terms of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indenture relating to our senior notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay 
two for one stock split 
our board of directors authorized a two for one stock split  effective for shareholders of record at the close of business on march   and increased our authorized common shares from million with a par value of 
per common share to million shares with the approval of shareholders on may  with a par value of

all prior period share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
other 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement  will be 
table of contents adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 
during  we currently anticipate spending approximately million on capital improvement projects at our existing facilities and on  among others  the following capital projects approximately million in connection with the completion of a second caster at our structural and rail division  related to the mesabi nugget project  million in connection with various scrap processing projects and million of various smaller individual projects at our existing operations 
these amounts do not include capital requirements that may arise from our involvement in new joint ventures or merger and acquisition activity that may occur throughout the year 
during  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately million 
based on our current abatements and incentive credits  and utilizing our existing long lived asset structure  we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately million  million  million  million    and  during the years through  respectively 
contractual obligations and other long term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the us securities and exchange commission 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles 
based on this definition  the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total after long term debt estimated interest payments on debt purchase obligations construction commitments lease commitments other commitments total the long term debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior unsecured notes remain outstanding until maturity 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our long term debt 
amounts include million related to our senior secured revolver which does not mature until  however  is classified as a current maturity due to our intention to repay this balance as free cash flow allows 

table of contents the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of on our million senior unsecured notes due october  on our million senior unsecured notes due april  on our million senior unsecured notes due april  on our outstanding senior secured revolver and term a balances  and on our other fixed rate debt of approximately million 
purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of natural gas and its transportation to be utilized within our production process 
these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions 
we have fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december  other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 
other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred  and in the future will continue to incur  capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
during  we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately million 
nearly of the costs incurred during for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements 
we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately million at all of our facilities during we have an accrual of  recorded as a contingency for environmental remediation related to our omnisource subsidiary 
we believe  apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities  that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years  and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments in note to our consolidated financial statements  we discuss new accounting policies adopted by steel dynamics during and the expected financial impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements 
table of contents requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
except for our steel fabrication operations segment  we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends  additional provision may be necessary 
our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract 
steel fabrication operations accounted for of our net sales 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers  which are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks  historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary  such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
inventories 
we record inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally on a first in  first out  basis 
impairments of long lived tangible and finite lived intangible assets 
in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist  we perform an impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as required by fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as amended 
goodwill is allocated to various reporting units  which are generally one level below our operating segments 
we utilize a two stepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment 
the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment 
in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a 
table of contents net present value of future cash flows 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  we perform the second step of the test  which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded  if any 
in the second step  we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 
our other indefinite lived intangible assets are related to trademarks acquired through various business combinations as follows  as of december  in thousands the techs omnisource corporation we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount 
the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to interest rate changes 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage 
a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
we have an interest rate swap agreement swap agreement with a notional amount of million in order to mitigate interest rate volatility exposure associated with the cost of our senior secured credit facility 
the swap agreement is scheduled to terminate on october  under the terms of the swap agreement  we are entitled to receive on the th of each month interest payments at a floating rate based on the one month libor rate and we are obligated to make interest payments on the th of each month at a fixed rate of 
the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt as of december  in thousands interest rate risk fixed rate variable rate principal average rate principal average rate expected maturity date thereafter total fair value commodity risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process  such as metallic raw materials  electricity  natural gas and alloys 
our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities 
certain commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to months for physical commodity requirements and for up to years for commodity transportation requirements 

table of contents our commitments for natural gas and its transportation with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december are as follows in thousands thereafter we fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 
we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december the contract designates hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per mill kwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 
in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers for future delivery of nonferrous metals 
our risk strategy has generally been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin  within certain parameters  that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer 
at december  we had a cumulative unrealized loss primarily associated with these financial contracts of million 
we expect the customer contracts to be fully consummated
