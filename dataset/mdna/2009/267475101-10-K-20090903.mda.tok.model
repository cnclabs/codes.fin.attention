item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto  as well as the business and risk factors sections of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services 
these services are provided throughout the united states and include engineering  construction  maintenance and installation services to telecommunications providers  underground facility locating services to various utilities including telecommunications providers  and other construction and maintenance services to electric utilities and others 
additionally  we provide services on a limited basis in canada 
for the fiscal year ended july   the percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications  underground facility locating  and electric utilities and other customers  was approximately   and  respectively 
we conduct operations through our subsidiaries 
our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers  as well as changes in the general level of construction activity 
the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications customers may be impacted by consumer demands on telecommunication providers  the introduction of new communication technologies  the physical maintenance needs of their infrastructure  the actions of the federal communications commission  and general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years 
we are currently a party to over of these agreements 
master service agreements generally contain customer specified service requirements  such as discrete pricing for individual tasks 
to the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity  there are often a number of exceptions  including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers  perform work with the customer s own employees  and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility 
in most cases  a customer may terminate these agreements for convenience with written notice 
the remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts for specific projects are generally of three to four months in duration 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing may be withheld by the customer pending project completion 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are 
table of contents recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
the following table summarizes our revenues from multi year master service agreements and other long term contracts  as a percentage of contract revenues from continuing operations fiscal year end july  july  july  multi year master service agreements other long term contracts total long term contracts the percentage of revenue from long term contracts varies between periods depending on the volume of work performed under the company s contracts 
during fiscal  a higher percentage of revenue was earned for services performed under short term contracts  including services related to the hurricanes that impacted the southern united states during september of a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total revenue from those customers who contributed at least to our total revenue from continuing operations in fiscal   or fiscal year ended july  july  july  at t verizon comcast time warner cable centurylink charter windstream qwest questar gas for comparison purposes  at t inc and bellsouth corporation revenues have been combined for periods prior to their december merger 
for comparison purposes  centurytel  inc and embarq corporation revenues have been combined for periods prior to their july merger 
cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including costs for direct labor provided by employees  services by subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation and amortization  and insurance claims and other related costs 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a change in claims experience or actuarial assumptions related to these risks could materially affect our results of operations 
for a majority of the contract services we perform  our customers provide all necessary materials and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment necessary to perform installation and maintenance services 
materials supplied by our customers  for which the customer retains financial and performance risk  are not included in our revenue or costs of sales 
in addition  cost of earned revenues for fiscal includes million related to the settlement of a legal matter 
general and administrative costs include all of our corporate costs  as well as costs of our subsidiaries management personnel and administrative overhead 
these costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses  including stock based compensation  legal and professional fees  information technology and 
table of contents development costs  provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense  and other costs that are not directly related to our services under customer contracts 
our senior management  including the senior managers of our subsidiaries  perform substantially all of our sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material sales and marketing expenses 
we are subject to concentrations of credit risk relating primarily to our cash and equivalents  trade accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
cash and equivalents primarily include balances on deposit in banks 
we maintain substantially all of our cash and equivalents at financial institutions we believe to be of high credit quality 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the balances held as cash in operating accounts with these financial institutions is within the current insurance levels of the federal deposit insurance corporation 
to date we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
we grant credit under normal payment terms  generally without collateral  to our customers 
these customers primarily consist of telephone companies  cable television multiple system operators and electric utilities 
with respect to a portion of the services provided to these customers  we have certain statutory lien rights which may in certain circumstances enhance our collection efforts 
adverse changes in overall business and economic factors may impact our customers and increase potential credit risks 
these risks may be heightened as a result of the current economic climate and market volatility 
in the past  some of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties and likewise  some may experience financial difficulties in the future 
these difficulties expose us to increased risks related to the collectability of amounts due for services performed 
we believe that none of our significant customers were experiencing financial difficulties that would impact the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings as of july  during the third quarter of fiscal  one of our customers proposed a financial restructuring effected through a chapter filing 
as part of its financial restructuring  this customer has received authorization from the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york to continue to pay its trade creditors in full  including us 
this customer represented of our contract revenues for the fiscal year ended july  additionally  approximately million or of the combined total of trade accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings was outstanding for work preformed for this customer as of july  we believe these balances are collectible  however  there can be no assurances this customer will continue to implement its financial restructuring as currently approved 
during fiscal  we were contacted by counsel representing current and former employees alleging violations of the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws at our utiliquest  llc  sts  llc and locating  inc subsidiaries 
the claims included periods dating primarily from september through january  and covered a number of states where these subsidiaries conducted business 
during the second quarter of fiscal  these subsidiaries reached an agreement to settle these claims through a structured mediation process 
excluding legal expenses  approximately million was incurred pursuant to the settlement and was included in accrued liabilities as of july  this amount was paid in october in december  two former employees of apex digital  llc apex  a wholly owned subsidiary that was previously discontinued  commenced a lawsuit against the subsidiary in illinois state court on behalf of themselves and purporting to represent other similarly situated employees in illinois 
the lawsuit alleged that apex violated certain minimum wage laws under the fair labor standards act and related state laws by failing to comply with applicable minimum wage and overtime pay requirements 
in june  the subsidiary reached an agreement to settle these claims through a structured mediation process and incurred a charge of approximately million for the settlement 
in january  we paid the outstanding liability related to the settlement 
from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are parties to various other claims and legal proceedings 
additionally  as part of our insurance program  we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
for these claims  the effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount needed to satisfy our insurance deductibles or retentions 
it is the opinion of our management  based on information available at this time  that none of such other pending claims or proceedings will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify  acquire  and successfully integrate companies 
in september  we acquired the outstanding common stock of broadband installation services formerly cable express for a purchase price of approximately million  including transaction fees  and assumed million in capital lease obligations 
during december  we acquired the outstanding common stock of prince telecom holdings prince for a purchase price of approximately million  including transaction fees 
broadband installation services and prince provide specialty contracting services for leading cable multiple system operators 
these services include the installation and maintenance of customer premise equipment  including set top boxes and cable modems 
in january  we acquired certain assets of a cable television operator for approximately million 
in march  we acquired certain assets of cavo communications  inc cavo for million and assumed million in capital lease obligations and certain other liabilities 
cavo provides specialty contracting services for leading cable multiple system operators 
neither of these two acquisitions was material to our revenue  results of operations or financial position 
discontinued operations during fiscal  apex  a wholly owned subsidiary  notified its primary customer of its intention to cease performing installation services in accordance with its contractual rights 
effective december  this customer  a satellite broadcast provider  transitioned its installation service requirements to others and apex ceased providing these services 
as a result  we have discontinued the operations of apex and presented its results separately in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
the cessation of these installation services has not had any material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
outlook the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to governmental deregulation  advances in technology  increased competition as the telephone and cable industries converge  and growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services 
as a result of these factors  the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability 
telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  provide flexibility in workforce sizing  expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success 
these factors drive customer demand for our services 
telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers in order to respond to demands for capacity  reliability  and product bundles of voice  video  and high speed data services 
fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services 
these voice services require the installation of customer premise equipment and at times the upgrade of in home wiring 
additionally  fiber deployments are also facilitating the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services 
during and  several large telephone companies announced fiber to the premise and fiber to the node initiatives as a means to begin to compete actively with cable operators 
these initiatives have continued through fiscal and are expected to continue during fiscal  resulting in demand for the type of services we provide 
we also provide underground facility locating services to a variety of utility companies  including telecommunication providers 
underground excavation is involved in a substantial portion of overall economic activity  including the construction and maintenance of telephone  cable television  power  water  sewer  and gas utility networks  the construction and maintenance of roads and highways as well as the construction of new and existing 
table of contents commercial and residential projects 
utility line locating is required prior to underground excavation 
the trend for outsourcing this requirement  along with the pace of overall economic activity influence the demand for utility line locating services 
growth in economic activity slowed substantially during fiscal the duration of the current economic weakness and the impact that it will have on our customers remain uncertain 
the economic slowdown  when combined with developments in the financial and credit markets  has created a challenging business environment for us and our customers 
we are closely monitoring the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers and our business  including rising fuel costs  and we continue to manage the areas of the business that we can control 
these areas include  but are not limited to  deploying appropriate workforce levels and supervisory employees  practicing sound safety procedures  managing fuel consumption levels and maintaining the investment in our fleet of vehicles and equipment to support current and future business opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  accrued insurance claims  asset lives used in determining depreciation and amortization  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation expense for performance awards  and the outcome of contingencies  including legal matters 
these estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies affect our reported and expected financial results and are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies described herein  and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
factors that we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are 
table of contents recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
accrued insurance claims 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is actuarially determined and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued insurance claims 
as of july   the liability for accrued claims and related accrued processing costs was million compared to million at july  based on payment patterns of similar prior claims  we expect million of the amount accrued at july  to be paid within the next months 
we estimate the liability for claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
when loss reserves are recorded they are not discounted  even though they will not be paid until some time in the future 
factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include  but are not limited to  the frequency of future claims  the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred  changes in the medical condition of claimants  and other factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
the decrease in accrued insurance claims at july  was primarily due to decreased operating levels and the timing of claims payments  including payments of million for a group of prior year accrued insurance claims during fiscal with regard to losses occurring in fiscal year and fiscal  we have retained the risk of loss of up to million on a per occurrence basis for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation 
these annual retention amounts are applicable to all of the states in which we operate  except with respect to workers compensation insurance in three states in which the company participates in a state sponsored insurance fund 
aggregate stop loss coverage for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims is million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for losses under our employee health plan occurring during fiscal and fiscal  we have retained the risk of loss  on an annual basis  of  per participant 
goodwill and intangible assets as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
during fiscal  goodwill was reduced by approximately million for the impairment charge described below 
goodwill also decreased by approximately million for the reversal of income tax liabilities no longer required 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

our reporting units and related indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
in addition  they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
 we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 
we use judgment in assessing if goodwill and intangible assets are impaired 
estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
to 
table of contents measure fair value  we employ a combination of present value techniques which reflect market factors 
changes in our judgments and projections could result in significantly different estimates of fair value resulting in additional impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues within a limited number of customers  and the level of overall economic activity 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole 
specifically during times of economic slowdown  our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of our reporting units could decline resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value 
during fiscal  our market capitalization was significantly impacted by the extreme volatility in the us equity and credit markets and was below the book value of shareholders equity as of the end of our second quarter 
as a result  we evaluated whether the decrease in our market capitalization reflected factors that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying value 
based on a combination of factors  including the economic environment  the sustained period of decline in our market capitalization  and the implied valuation and discount rate assumptions in our industry  we concluded there were sufficient indicators to perform an interim impairment test of the reporting units and applicable intangible assets as of january  our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units was based on projections of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
the key assumptions impacting the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal interim impairment analysis were a expected cash flow for a period of seven years  b terminal value based upon terminal growth rates of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the discount rate used in the fiscal analysis increased compared to our fiscal annual analysis described below due to economic conditions and lower industry valuation comparisons 
this increase in the discount rate caused a substantial decline in the calculated estimate of fair value of the reporting units 
we believe the assumptions used in the fiscal interim impairment analysis were consistent with the risk inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry 
as a result of our impairment analysis  we determined that the estimated fair value of the broadband installation services  c utility contractors c  ervin cable construction ervin  nichols communications nichols  stevens communications stevens  and utiliquest reporting units were less than their respective carrying values 
accordingly  we performed a further analysis to determine the implied fair value of each reporting units goodwill 
this analysis included a hypothetical valuation of all of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting units as if they had been acquired in separate business combinations 
we recognized a preliminary goodwill impairment charge of million during the second quarter of fiscal our interim impairment analysis was finalized during the third quarter of fiscal and no further charges were incurred 
the second quarter charge included impairments at the following reporting units broadband installation services for million  c for million  ervin for million  nichols for million  stevens for million and utiliquest for million 
after the charges  the c  nichols  and stevens reporting units have no remaining goodwill 
the goodwill impairment charge did not affect our compliance with any covenants under our revolving credit agreement or senior subordinated notes 
furthermore  an interim impairment test of our finite lived intangible assets was also performed under the guidance of sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 recoverability was determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
we determined there was no impairment of any of our finite lived intangible assets during fiscal we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
however  the estimated fair value of the prince telecom prince 
table of contents reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a margin less than 
there were also smaller margins of fair value over carrying value for the broadband installations services  ervin  and utiliquest reporting units  as their carrying values were written down to their estimated fair values during fiscal as a result  the goodwill balances of these reporting units may have an increased likelihood of impairment in future periods if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change and the long term outlook for their cash flows were adversely impacted 
broadband installation services  ervin  prince  and utiliquest have remaining goodwill balances of million  million  million  and million  respectively  as of july  except for the goodwill impairment charges  none of our reporting units has incurred significant losses in fiscal the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties 
changes in our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in impairments of goodwill or intangible assets at additional reporting units 
a change in the estimated discount rate used would impact the amount of the goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal additionally  continued adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could further impact the valuation of our reporting units 
we can provide no assurances that  if such conditions continue  they will not trigger additional impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our stevens reporting unit and nichols reporting unit were impaired and consequently recognized goodwill impairment charges of approximately and million  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the fiscal analysis used the same valuation techniques described for the fiscal interim analysis 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal annual impairment analysis were a expected cash flow for a period of seven years  b terminal value based upon terminal growth rates of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate during the period of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the assumptions used in the fiscal annual impairment analysis were consistent with the risk inherent in the business models of our reporting units at the time the analysis was performed 
the fiscal impairment of stevens and nichols was primarily the result of a change in management s expectations of long term cash flows from customers of these reporting units 
as disclosed in our previous filings with the securities and exchange commission  each of these reporting units has a concentration of revenues from a limited number of customers 
changes in anticipated demand had an adverse impact on the expected future cash flows of the reporting units used in the annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduction in demand is the result of customers allocating their capital spending away from work management anticipated would be performed by these reporting units 
in performing the sfas no 
impairment assessment  management determined that this shift in demand was more than temporary  consequently impacting the expected cash flows over the seven year period used in our goodwill analysis 
as of july   we believe the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset is recoverable  however  there can be no assurances that they will not be impaired in future periods 
certain of our reporting units also have other intangible assets including tradenames and customer relationship intangibles 
as of july   management believes that the carrying amounts of the intangible assets are recoverable 
however  if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable  the assets would be reviewed for impairment and the assets may become impaired 
stock based compensation 
our stock based award programs are intended to attract  retain and reward talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
we grant stock options  time based and performance based restricted stock units to certain employees and officers 
the fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on certain assumptions 
the fair value of restricted shares and units is estimated on the date of grant and is generally equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant 
time vesting restricted units vest ratably over a period of four years and are settled in one share of our common stock on the vesting date 
performance vesting restricted shares and units vest over a three year period from the date of grant  if certain performance goals are achieved 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  compensation costs for performance based awards are recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance goal will be satisfied 
we use our best 
table of contents judgment to determine the probability of achieving the performance goals at each reporting period and recognize compensation costs based on our estimate of the shares that are expected to vest 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a two step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
this fsp amends fin to provide guidance that a company may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax position is effectively as opposed to ultimately settled through examination  negotiation  or litigation 
we adopted the provisions of fin on july   the first day of fiscal see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the adoption of the interpretation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances on a regular basis 
this analysis considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we recognize an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we believe that none of our significant customers are experiencing significant financial difficulty as of july  that will materially affect our accounts receivable or allowance for doubtful accounts 
any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued  we evaluate  among other factors  the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
if only a range of probable loss can be determined  we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency 
in those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another  we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with sfas no 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations

the decline in the amount of general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from a reduction in stock based compensation expense  which decreased to million during fiscal from million for fiscal partially offsetting the dollar amount of the decline was an increase in expenses related to information technology and development initiatives including payroll  professional fees and other expenses 
these initiatives are designed to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency and contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues 
additionally  some of our expenses  such as certain office and support costs and certain payroll costs  do not proportionately change as fluctuations in revenue occur 
during fiscal  these types of costs contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues

as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our stevens reporting unit and nichols reporting unit were impaired and consequently recognized goodwill impairment charges of approximately and million  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal this determination was primarily the result of a change in management s expectations of long term cash flows for customers of stevens and nichols 
as disclosed in our previous filings with the securities and exchange commission  each of these reporting units has a concentration of revenues from a limited number of customers 
changes in anticipated demand had an adverse impact on the expected future cash flows of the reporting units used in the annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduction in demand is the result of customers allocating their capital spending away from work management anticipated would be performed by these reporting units 
in performing the sfas no 
impairment assessment  management determined that this shift in demand was more than temporary  consequently impacting the expected cash flows over the seven year period used in our goodwill analysis 
stevens and nichols have remaining goodwill of and million  respectively  subsequent to the impairment

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accrued insurance claims liability 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions at july  was million 
this amount has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions of the underlying tax positions with the relevant tax authorities 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have obligations under performance bonds related to certain of our customer contracts 
performance bonds generally provide a customer with the right to obtain payment and or performance from the issuer of the bond if we fail to perform our obligations under a contract 
as of july   we had million of outstanding performance bonds and no events have occurred in which the customers have exercised their rights under the performance bonds

the remaining future minimum lease commitments under these arrangements is approximately million for each of fiscal years through  and will total million in fiscal additionally  we paid million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  in subcontracting services to entities related to officers of certain of our subsidiaries 
there was a minimal amount paid in subcontracting services to entities related to officers of certain of our subsidiaries for other business purposes in fiscal sufficiency of capital resources 
we believe that our capital resources  including existing cash balances and amounts available under our credit agreement  are sufficient to meet our financial obligations 
these obligations include interest payments required on our notes and borrowings  working capital requirements  and the normal replacement of equipment at our current level of operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our ability to manage costs effectively 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  or to the extent we repurchase common stock or our senior subordinates notes  our capital requirements may increase 
although recent distress in the financial markets has not significantly impacted our financial position as of july  or our cash flows for fiscal  management continues to monitor the financial markets and assess general economic conditions 
if further changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely impact 
table of contents our ability to access capital markets  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and existing committed credit facilities to provide short term funding 
we believe that our cash investment policies are conservative and we expect that the current volatility in the capital markets will not have a material impact on our cash investments 
backlog 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long term requirements contracts 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally our experience in procurements of this type 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate  particularly in light of the current economic conditions and the uncertainty that imposes on changes in our customer s requirements for our services 
our backlog totaled million and billion at july  and july   respectively 
we expect to complete of the july  backlog during fiscal seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income loss as a result of other factors  including the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  seasonal budgetary spending patterns of customers and the timing of budget approvals  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuations in results of operations caused by acquisitions  fluctuation in the employer portion of payroll taxes as a result of reaching the limitation on social security withholdings and unemployment obligations  changes in mix of customers  contracts  and business activities  fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions  fluctuations in stock based compensation expense as a result of performance criteria in performance based share awards  as well as the timing and vesting period of all stock based awards  fluctuations in performance cash awards as a result of operating results  fluctuations interest expense due to levels of debt and related borrowing costs  fluctuations in other income as a result of the timing and levels of capital assets sold during the period  and fluctuations in income tax expense due to levels of taxable earnings 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period

due to the fixed rate of interest on the notes  changes in interest rates would not have an impact on the related interest expense 
the fair value of the outstanding notes totaled approximately million as of july  based on quoted market prices 
there exists market risk sensitivity on the fair value of the fixed rate notes with respect to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the market interest rates in effect would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the notes of approximately million  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
we had million of capital leases outstanding at july  with varying rates of interest due through fiscal under separate lease agreements 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates in effect at july  on these capital leases would not have a material impact on the fair value of the leases or on our annual interest cost 
we also have market risk for foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in canada 
as of july   the market risk for foreign currency exchange rates was not significant as our operations in canada have not been material
