we currently manage sixteen facilities  comprised of six skilled nursing centers  seven assisted living residences and three independent living senior housing facilities  totaling approximately beds 
we have an ownership interest in eight of the facilities we manage  comprised of ownership of two skilled nursing facilities and two assisted living facilities  ownership in one independent living facility as well as a ownership in three assisted living facilities 
we lease one additional skilled nursing facility 
the assisted living facilities that we own operate under the name hearth home  with the tag line home is where the hearth is we also maintain a development consulting initiative which is strategic in providing potential management opportunities to our core long term care business 
adcare health systems  inc and hearth home are registered trademarks 
all of our properties are located within the state of ohio 
we focus on two primary indicators in evaluating the financial performance of our business 
those indicators are facility occupancy and staffing 
facility occupancy is important as higher occupancy generally leads to higher revenue 
according to the ohio health care association  average nursing home occupancy within ohio was for over the past years  occupancy has averaged statewide according to the state of ohio 
our nursing homes averaged for and assisted living averaged 
for our nursing facilities averaged and assisted living averaged 
statewide averages are not published for assisted living facilities 
in recent years  we observed the trend that more seniors were staying in their homes for a longer period of time prior to moving into a long term care setting 
we have also observed that more seniors are using nursing and assisted living facilities for short rehabilitation stays and then moving back to their homes 
we have taken advantage of this opportunity and expanded our operations to provide personal care and health care services in the home 
accordingly  in january   we acquired assured health care  a home health care service provider located in dayton  ohio 
assured has been providing home health care services in the greater dayton area for nearly years 
on may   we completed our acquisition of the new lincoln lodge 
this acquisition was effective april  consequently  many of the expense areas in our income statement have increased 
the new lincoln lodge is a unit senior living facility located in columbus  ohio 
during  we completed refinancing three of our assisted living facilities and one skilled nursing facility 
the new financings are long term fixed interest rate non recourse hud insured loans 

table of contents segments our business operates in two segments management and facility based care and home based care 
in our management and facility based care segment  we derive revenues from three primary sources 
we operate and have ownership interests in eight facilities for which we collect fees from the residents of those facilities 
profits losses are generated to the extent that the monthly patient fees exceed the costs associated with operating those facilities 
we also manage assisted living facilities and skilled nursing facilities owned by third parties 
with respect to these facilities  we receive a management fee based on the revenue generated by the facilities 
within our management facility based care segment  we provide development  consulting and accounting services to third parties 
in these instances  we receive a fee for providing those services 
these fees vary from project to project  with the development fee in most cases being based on a percentage of the total cost to develop the project 
management and facility based care segment we have implemented changes at our skilled nursing facilities to improve occupancy and revenue 
we have recently completed renovations at two facilities we own and one facility we lease with additional renovations planned during we continue to focus our attention towards providing care to more patients covered by medicare where our profit margins are typically higher than those of medicaid

net loss declined as result of the higher rates charged as well increases in medicare covered residents 
total assets increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of the new lincoln lodge 
home based care segment our home health division has reduced and  in most cases  eliminated services to patients where our reimbursement provided very little profit margin 
this has resulted in a lower number of patient visits and lower revenue but increased profit margins 
the majority of the reduced revenue has been offset by lower payroll and related expenses 
the benefits of this change have been offset by overall lower visits than anticipated 
we are in the process of utilizing our home health services in our assisted living and independent living properties creating cross selling opportunities which will further enhance our revenue 
these needs have previously been satisfied by other home health agencies 
revenue in our home based care segment decreased approximately  or 
this is primarily the result of eliminating services to low margin payer sources 
net profit increased approximately  or due to increasing services to primarily medicare and commercial insurance covered patients offset by accrued expenses for income tax payable

for instance  the acuity of our assisted living residents affects the monthly fees we charge them and the fees increase in relation to the level of services required to take care of them 
in the skilled nursing facilities  patients who are covered under medicare are paid higher reimbursement rates than patients who are covered under medicaid 
also  the length of stay in our nursing homes affects cash flow 
in our nursing homes and assisted living homes  our strategy is to try to provide all the services required to keep our patients in our facilities as long as we can to age in place 
our cash requirements are satisfied primarily with cash generated from operating activities and debt 
our cash flow is dependent on our ability to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner 
accounts receivable collections in the health care industry can be very complex processes 
at december   approximately of our skilled nursing facility residents were covered by the medicaid and medicare programs 
these are reliable payment sources which make our likelihood of collection very high 
however  the time it takes to receive payment on a claim from these sources can be long 
on average  accounts receivable were outstanding nearly days before collection as of december  which is lower than december  days of the status of collection efforts is monitored very closely by our senior management 
see additional discussion under patient care receivables in the critical accounting policies and use of estimates on page december  as compared to december  during  we satisfied our cash requirements primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
our cash was used principally for the operations of our properties

net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and december  was approximately  and  respectively

repayments on note payable to stockholder were the result of refinancing the loan with traditional bank debt 
repayments on notes payable were the result of refinancing existing debt as well as routine debt repayments 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  this is primarily the result of routine repayments on notes payable and additional financing costs incurred as a result of refinancing one of our properties 
inflation the resident fees that we receive from the properties that we own or lease and the management fees we receive from the facilities we manage for third parties are our primary source of income at this time 
this source of income is affected by the monthly rental rates and the occupancy rates 
the monthly rental rates are dependent on various factors including competition  market conditions and the locations of the properties 
we evaluate and prepare budgets for our properties on an annual basis 
at that time  we assess the impact of inflation on the operations of the properties  including but not limited to  budgeting increases for real estate taxes  utilities  employee expenses  food and supplies 
however  some factors are difficult to quantify  such as potential increases in employee expenses as a result of the current shortage of qualified nurses  and there can be no assurance that the resident rental rates will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes 
we strive to be the provider of choice in each of our markets and to charge market or better than market rates 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business knowledge and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
these estimates are evaluated by management and revised as circumstances change 
we believe that the following are critical accounting policies our financial statements reflect consolidation with entities in which we have determined to have a controlling financial interest in december of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin r which addresses the consolidation of business enterprises which focus on primary beneficiaries in variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
we have evaluated our relationship with community s hearth home  ltd  and determined that these entities are variable interest entities pursuant to finr of which we are the primary beneficiary 
we consolidated the entities as of december  patient care receivables patient care receivables are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the administrators and managers of our properties evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis  and adjustments are made if necessary 
on an ongoing basis  we have experienced very few collection problems and do not anticipate significant increases unless the economy where our properties are located encounters a severe down trend 
approximately of our revenue in our nursing facilities is derived from medicare and medicaid qualifying residents 
charges to these payers are evaluated monthly to insure that revenue is recorded properly and that any adjustments necessitated by our contractual arrangement with these payers are recorded in the month incurred 
long lived assets and goodwill we account for our long lived assets of property  plant and equipment other than goodwill by applying the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review the value of our long lived assets on an 
table of contents annual basis or sooner if required for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the determination and measurement of an impairment loss under these accounting standards requires the significant use of judgment and estimates based on many factors which can be subject to changing circumstances 
some of the changing circumstances could be market conditions  interest rates  competition and the economy 
beginning january   we accounted for goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires us to no longer amortize goodwill 
we now test goodwill on an annual basis for the purpose of assessing the potential of its impairment and making the appropriate adjustments if required 
we no longer amortize costs associated with the acquisition of certificates of need required in ohio for nursing homes
