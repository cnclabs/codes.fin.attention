our company we design  develop  manufacture and sell hard drives 
a hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks to store and allow fast access to data 
hard drives are key components of computers  including desktop and notebook computers pcs  data storage subsystems and many consumer electronic ce devices 
we sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms for use in computer systems  subsystems or ce devices  and to distributors  resellers and retailers 
our hard drives are used in desktop computers  notebook computers  and enterprise applications such as servers  workstations  network attached storage  storage area networks and video surveillance equipment 
additionally  our hard drives are used in ce applications such as digital video recorders dvrs  and satellite and cable set top boxes stbs 
we also sell our hard drives as stand alone storage products and integrate them into finished enclosures  embedding application software and offering the products as wd branded external storage appliances for personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music  photographs  video and other digital data 

table of contents hard drives provide non volatile data storage  which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device 
our hard drives currently include inch and inch form factor drives  having capacities ranging from gigabytes gb to terabytes tb  nominal rotation speeds up to  revolutions per minute rpm  and offer interfaces including both enhanced integrated drive electronics eide and serial advanced technology attachment sata 
we also embed our hard drives into wd branded external storage appliances using interfaces such as usb  external sata  firewire tm and ethernet network connections with capacities of gb up to tb 
in addition  we offer a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than standard drives  using our wd greenpower technology tm 
in the second quarter of  we began to design  develop  manufacture and sell media players 
a media player is a device that connects to a user s television or home theater system and plays digital movies  music and photos from any of our wd branded external hard drives or other usb mass storage devices 
we sell our media players worldwide to resellers and retailers under our wd brand 
in the third quarter of  we acquired siliconsystems  inc siliconsystems and began to design  develop  manufacture and sell solid state drives

restructuring costs totaled million and consisted of million of asset impairment charges  million of employee termination benefits and million of contract termination and other exit costs 
total cash expenditures related to the restructuring activities were approximately million 
during our fourth fiscal quarter  we sold our media substrate manufacturing facility  and related assets  in sarawak  malaysia for net proceeds of approximately million  resulting in a gain of million 
the closure and disposal of our manufacturing facilities was to realign our manufacturing capacity with our expectations regarding demand at that time 
during our fourth fiscal quarter  we experienced a much stronger demand than originally anticipated 
we expect continuing sequential growth in our first quarter of fiscal as a result  in our first quarter of fiscal  we reopened the hard drive manufacturing facility in thailand that we previously closed as part of our restructuring plan

as of july   wdti had million available for future borrowings on the revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants 
purchase orders in the normal course of business  we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products 
these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter  are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components  and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components 
we also enter into purchase orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the equipment 
our ability to change or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered 
in some cases  we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to  or cancellation of  a purchase order  such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or capital equipment 
we have entered into long term purchase agreements with various component suppliers which contain minimum quantity requirements 
however  the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered  achievement of pre defined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations 
the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in purchase obligations in the table above 
we have also entered into long term purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future purchases  contingent on certain conditions of performance  quality and technology of the vendor s components 
these arrangements are included under purchase obligations in the table above

please see item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of risks related to these commitments 
foreign exchange contracts we purchase short term  forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets  liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies 
see part ii  item a  under the heading disclosure about foreign currency risk  for our current forward exchange contract commitments 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  vendors  lessors  business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of such agreements  products or services to be provided by us  or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 
stock repurchase program our board of directors previously authorized us to repurchase million of our common stock in open market transactions under a program through march  since the inception of this stock repurchase program in  through july   we have repurchased million shares for a total cost of million including commissions 
we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows 
we may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities and shareholders equity 
we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue and accounts receivable in accordance with standard industry practice  we provide resellers with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and other sales incentive programs 
in accordance with current accounting standards  we recognize revenue upon delivery to oems  odms and resellers and record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers 
we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period  reseller s sell through and inventory levels  estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers  historical pricing information and customer claim processing 
if customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differ from our expectations  our operating results could be affected 
we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products and such sales incentive and marketing programs are recorded 
table of contents as a reduction of revenue 
these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions  seasonal demand  competitor actions  channel mix and overall availability of product 
since  total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged from to of gross revenues per quarter 
changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to increase our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range 
adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged of quarterly gross revenue since we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses 
if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due  or if our overall loss history changes significantly  an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required  which could affect operating results 
we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
we base these provisions on existing product return notifications 
if actual sales returns exceed expectations  an increase in the sales return accrual would be required  which could negatively affect operating results 
warranty we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized 
we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years 
our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends  estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues  if any 
we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates 
our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability  such as factory test data  historical field return rates  and costs to repair by product type 
if actual product return trends  costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
also  during a period of declining revenue  the percentage of warranty utilization to revenue may increase 
our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 
we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty 
any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income 
such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair 
for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to pre existing warranty provisions  refer to part ii  item  note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out and weighted average methods or net realizable value 
we use the first in  first out method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories  while we use the weighted average method to value precious metal inventories 
weighted average cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us 
we have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and  as such  we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weighted average cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in production 
the weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a first in  first out method 
we record inventory write downs for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information  and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis 
unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products  which may require a write down of inventory that could negatively affect operating results 

table of contents litigation and other contingencies we apply sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies 
accordingly  we disclose material contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrue loss contingencies when  in consultation with our legal advisors  we conclude that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable refer to part ii
