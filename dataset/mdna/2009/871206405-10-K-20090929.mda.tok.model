we believe our products enable network operators to efficiently and cost effectively provision and manage network capacity to support a wide range of converged services such as voice  video and data 
total revenue for fiscal was million  a decrease of compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal was million  a decrease of compared to fiscal our net loss for fiscal was million compared to a net loss for fiscal of million 
we operate in a challenging business environment 
we believe the service provider markets that the company serves have been and will continue to be impacted by the recent global economic downturn  resulting in reduced or delayed capital spending 
our lower revenue and net loss in fiscal reflects the impact of this reduced capital spending 
the constraints in capital spending have compounded the company s pre existing challenges of customer concentration and unpredictability  particularly for our core switching products  and led us to initiate certain cost reduction actions during the fourth quarter of fiscal these actions were in addition to the actions previously taken during our first and second quarters of fiscal we anticipate that the annualized cost savings across all functional areas associated with these actions will approximate million 
the fourth quarter actions were taken in order to re align our cost structure  pace our development in line with customer requirements with a more measured view toward future offerings  and to better position the company for success in the longer term 
the combination of current business  economic and market conditions  together with our current estimate of future demand and the resultant cost reduction actions initiated during our fourth quarter  combined to give rise to an impairment in the carrying value of the company s goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  requiring a non cash impairment charge of million 
the charge represents the full carrying value of such assets on the company s balance sheet 
an additional non cash impairment charge of million was also applicable to certain fixed assets 
net loss for fiscal includes total asset impairment charges of million 
impairment charges included in net loss for fiscal were million 
we remain focused on improvements in our business 
we will continue to consider strategic options that may serve to maximize shareholder value 
these options include acquiring or making strategic investments in 
table of contents companies with either complementary technologies or in other markets to add complementary products and services  expanding the markets we serve and diversifying our customer base 
our total cash  cash equivalents and investments were million at july  included in this amount were cash and cash equivalents of million 
we intend to fund our operations  including fixed commitments under operating leases  and any required capital expenditures for the foreseeable future using our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe that  based on our business plans and current conditions  our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we also believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will enable us to pursue the strategic options discussed above 
as of july   sycamore and its subsidiaries employed persons  which was a net decrease of persons from the persons employed on july  we estimate that our headcount upon completion of the cost reductions actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal will approximate critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those relating to revenue recognition  investments  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  litigation and other contingencies  intangible assets and goodwill and share based compensation expense 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
differences between our estimates and the actual results are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the estimate is changed 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments  assumptions and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
changes in these estimates can affect materially the amount of our reported net income or loss 
revenue recognition the company s products enable service providers to efficiently and cost effectively provision and manage multiservice access and optical capacity to support a wide range of converged services such as voice  video and data 
as our customer requirements have evolved  the software component of our product has become more than incidental to its functionality 
accordingly  for such arrangements where software is more than incidental to the functionality of the product  the company recognizes revenue pursuant to the requirements of statement of position sop software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
the company applied the provisions of sop  as amended  to substantially all of its customer arrangements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with sop  the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met the company has persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer  the company delivers the products  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of sales contracts or agreements and customer purchase orders 
product delivery occurs when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
if uncertainties exist regarding customer acceptance  the company recognizes revenue when all uncertainties are resolved 
the company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 

table of contents collectability is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer s payment history to the company 
for arrangements which include the delivery of multiple elements  revenue is allocated for all elements based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value 
vsoe is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately or the price is established by management having the relevant authority 
in situations where vsoe exists for all elements delivered and undelivered  the company allocates the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements  based on their relative fair value 
for transactions where vsoe exists only for the undelivered elements  the company uses the residual method and defers the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognizes the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred as revenue 
if vsoe does not exist for undelivered items that are services  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining service period 
if vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or features  all revenue is deferred until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which vsoe for the undelivered elements is determined 
revenue from installation or other services is recognized as work is performed or ratably over the service period 
for arrangements in which the software component was incidental to the functionality of the product  the company recognized revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
for arrangements in which the software component was incidental to the functionality of the product and that involved the delivery or performance of multiple elements  the determination as to how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate deliverables of the arrangement was determined in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when an arrangement involved multiple elements  the entire fee from the arrangement was allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element was met 
fair value for each element was established based on the sales price charged when the same element was sold separately 
if fair value did not exist for any undelivered element  revenue was not recognized until the earlier of i the delivery of the undelivered element or ii fair value of the undelivered element existed  unless the undelivered element was a service  in which case revenue was recognized as the service was performed once the service was the only undelivered element 
investments we account for our marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

our investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss recorded as an element of stockholders equity 
the fair value of investments is determined based on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those instruments 
we evaluate our investments for potential impairment on a quarterly basis and would recognize an impairment charge should a decline in the fair value of investments below the related cost basis be judged to be other than temporary 
the primary factors that are considered in assessing the nature of the impairment include  i the credit quality of the underlying security  ii the extent to which and time period during which the fair value of the investment has been below cost  iii the expected holding or recovery period for the investment  iv the company s intent to hold each investment until recovery and the likelihood that the company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery  and v the existence of evidence of default by the issuer 

table of contents warranty obligations we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience a change in warranty claims that vary from historical experience in our costs to provide warranty services  we may be required to adjust our warranty accrual 
a change in the warranty accrual will impact our gross margin 
inventory we continuously monitor inventory balances and record inventory provisions for any excess of the cost of the inventory over its estimated market value  based on assumptions about future demand  manufacturing quantities and market conditions 
while such assumptions may change from period to period  we measure the net realizable value of inventories using the best information available as of the balance sheet date 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional inventory provisions may be required 
once inventory has been written down to its estimated net realizable value  its carrying value can not be increased due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
accordingly  if inventory previously written down to its net realizable value is subsequently sold  gross profit margins would be favorably impacted 
litigation and other contingencies we are subject to various claims  litigation and other disputes  as well as potential liabilities associated with various tax matters 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims  litigation and tax matters and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  it may be necessary to revise our estimates related to these pending claims  litigation and other disputes and potential liabilities associated with various tax matters 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities are reflected in our results of operations in the period of change and could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets as a result of our acquisition of eastern research  inc  the company recorded goodwill in the amount of million 
this amount represented the remaining excess of the total purchase price of the eastern research acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we also identified and recorded intangible assets as a result of the acquisition 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we also review other long lived assets  including purchased intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future results and cash flows that our single reporting unit expects to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows are significantly diminished  intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we use the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
to measure impairment for goodwill  we compare the fair value of our single reporting unit by measuring discounted cash flows to the book value of the reporting unit 
goodwill would be impaired if the resulting implied fair value of goodwill was less than the recorded book value of the goodwill 

table of contents the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
the company has elected to perform its annual goodwill impairment testing as required under sfas on the last business day of our fiscal month june  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
reporting units are defined as operating segments or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
the company has determined that our single reporting unit is a component of our one operating segment 
the company allocates goodwill to the reporting unit at the time of acquisition 
the estimated fair value of our reporting unit is based on a discounted cash flow model derived from internal earnings and external market forecasts 
assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and in connection with the preparation of its revised plan for fiscal and its outlook beyond  the company updated its estimates of future demand for its core and access products 
the revised outlook resulted in a projection of lower discounted cash flows 
the combination of current business  economic and market conditions  together with our current estimate of future demand and the resultant cost reduction actions initiated during our fourth quarter  combined to give rise to an impairment in the carrying value of the company s goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded an impairment charge of million for the entire carrying value of goodwill and an impairment charge of million for the remaining carrying value of identified intangible assets 
an additional impairment charge of million was also recorded related to certain fixed assets 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company decided to discontinue the development of its acquired ox product  resulting in an asset impairment charge of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to cease further development of its acquired bsg product 
as a result  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred an intangible asset impairment charge of million related to the acquired dnx technology and customer relationships 
the impairment charge was primarily related to lower than previously estimated revenues from our dnx products 
there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal or share based compensation expense we account for share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we have estimated the fair value of share based options on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended july  and revenue the following table presents product and service revenue in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent revenue product service total revenue total revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal product revenue consists primarily of sales of our intelligent bandwidth management solutions 
product revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to deteriorating market and economic conditions  which created a slowdown in capital spending by service providers in general and  more specifically  a significant reduction in the level of orders from two customers 
service revenue consists primarily of fees for services relating to the maintenance of our products  installation services and training 
service revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in the level of installation and training revenues offset by a slight increase in maintenance revenue 
for fiscal  two customers accounted for and of revenue  or a combined of our total revenue 
two customers accounted for and of revenue in fiscal  or a combined of our total revenue 
international revenue represented of revenue in fiscal  compared to of revenue in fiscal we expect future revenue will continue to be highly concentrated in a relatively small number of customers 
the timing of customer deployments in any given quarter may cause shifts in both the number of greater than customers and in the percentage mix of domestic and international revenue 
the loss of any one of these customers or any substantial reduction or delay in orders by any one of these customers could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit the following table presents gross profit for product and services in thousands  except percentages year ended july  gross profit product service total gross profit product service total product gross profit cost of product revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers for purchased materials and services  internal manufacturing costs as well as provisions for warranty and rework costs and adjustments which may be required to reduce inventories to their lower of cost or market 
product gross 
table of contents profit decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a lower level of revenue in fiscal the revenue decline was driven by market and economic conditions which led to a general decline in capital spending by service providers and more specifically a reduction in the level of orders  primarily from two major customers 
product gross profit was also affected by net inventory provisions of million recorded in fiscal to adjust inventory carrying values to their lower of cost or market based on anticipated future usage and restructuring costs of million associated with certain workforce reductions and facility costs 
product gross profit may fluctuate from period to period due to revenue fluctuation  volume  pricing pressures resulting from intense competition in our industry as well as the enhanced negotiating leverage of certain larger customers 
in addition  product gross profit may be affected by changes in the mix of products sold  channels of distribution  overhead absorption  sales discounts  increases in labor costs  excess inventory and obsolescence charges  increases in component pricing or other material costs  the introduction of new products or the entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 
service gross profit cost of service revenue consists primarily of costs of providing services under customer service contracts which include salaries and related expenses and other fixed costs 
service gross profit and gross profit percentage increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the year over year dollar and percentage increases relate to a favorable shift in the mix of higher margin maintenance and support services rendered during fiscal compared to installation and training services 
as most of our service cost of revenue is fixed  increases or decreases in revenue will have a significant impact on service gross profit 
service gross profit may be affected in future periods by various factors including  but not limited to  the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services  competitive and economic pricing pressures  the enhanced negotiating leverage of certain larger customers  maintenance contract renewals and the timing of renewals 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent research and development sales and marketing general and administrative asset impairments restructuring expenses total operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related expenses and prototype costs relating to design  development  testing and enhancements of our products 
research and development expenses increased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily related to increased personnel costs and higher depreciation expense associated with the expansion of our shanghai facility 
at the beginning of fiscal we anticipated significant year over year growth in spending for domestic development and expansion of our shanghai development center and initiated certain incremental investments 
in light of economic and market conditions  which emerged during our first quarter  we slowed our expected pace of development expenditures 
as the fiscal year progressed  we recognized that market conditions had worsened and had given rise to a global economic slowdown in which cutbacks in capital spending by 
table of contents service providers were generally occurring and expected to continue for some time 
in response to these conditions we proceeded cautiously with development spending with a more measured approach to future offerings 
at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal we initiated actions to reduce workforce and other costs over several quarters 
workforce reductions were then implemented during the fourth quarter with further reductions implemented at the beginning of fiscal due to the timing of the initiated actions  research and development expenses in fiscal increased  primarily personnel costs  over the fiscal level 
we anticipate that the annualized savings realized from the cost reduction actions initiated near the end of fiscal  which are estimated to be approximately million  will result in substantially lower year over year research and development costs in fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses  amortization of customer evaluation inventory and other sales and marketing support expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to workforce reductions initiated early in fiscal  as well as lower commission expense on lower revenue  decreased spending for trade shows and lower amortization of customer evaluation equipment 
within our existing spending levels  we continue to allocate sales and marketing resources to those geographic regions where we see the most attractive opportunities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  amortization of intangible assets and other general corporate purposes 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses include costs and cost recoveries associated with the now concluded stock option investigation 
cost recoveries in fiscal totaled million while related costs in fiscal were million 
amortization of purchased intangibles in fiscal was million below fiscal the remaining year over year reduction relates to workforce and other cost reductions implemented in early fiscal asset impairments during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and in connection with the preparation of its revised plan for fiscal and its outlook beyond  the company updated its estimates of future demand for its core and access products 
the revised outlook resulted in a projection of lower discounted cash flows 
the company is continuing with its plan to streamline operations and to pace development efforts with a more measured approach toward future offerings  while maintaining the resources to meet customer commitments and advance selective new opportunities 
accordingly  the company conducted an assessment for impairment for its long lived assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of june   the last day of our fiscal month june  the company performed its annual goodwill assessment based on its revised outlook and discounted cash flow analysis 
the assessment indicated that the reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying value  including goodwill 
the subsequent step required that a valuation be conducted  similar to a purchase price allocation done in connection with an acquisition  in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
since the company operates as a single operating unit  the fair value of the intangible assets was determined as part of this valuation 
the result of the valuations determined that the reporting unit s goodwill and intangible assets were impaired  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million for goodwill and million for intangible assets 
in addition  certain fixed assets were also impaired  resulting in an additional non cash impairment charge of million 

table of contents restructuring during fiscal  the company recorded restructuring charges of million of which million was charged to operating expense and million to cost of product revenue 
the charges include workforce reductions primarily in sales  marketing  manufacturing and general administrative functions during the first and second quarters of fiscal totaling million million operating expense and million cost of product revenue 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced further workforce reductions 
certain of those workforce reductions  primarily affecting research and development  were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting in a charge of million 
the charge for workforce reductions primarily relates to employee separation packages  which include severance pay  benefits continuation and outplacement costs 
in addition  the company revised its estimate of rent and other facility costs associated with the consolidation of its new jersey facility resulting in a charge of million 
the aggregate fourth quarter fiscal charge was million million charged to operating expense and million charged to cost of product revenue 
as of july   remaining restructuring payments associated with these actions were million 
the remaining workforce reduction actions initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal were implemented in august and will result in a charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal this charge primarily relates to employee separation packages  which include severance pay  benefits continuation and outplacement costs 
in addition  in connection with a decision to exercise the early termination option with regard to our new jersey facility lease  we agreed to turn the property back to the lessor in advance of the early termination date in return for the cancellation of an early termination penalty and other consideration 
accordingly  we will also record a charge of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal to reflect our non cancellable lease obligation through the early termination date 
during the first quarter of  we completed a consolidation of our moorestown  new jersey facility and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this consolidation was in conjunction with the decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce our workforce across the company 
we completed these actions to better align development resources with future growth opportunities  further improve operational efficiencies  and capitalize on additional acquisition synergies 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a restructuring charge related to rent and other facility charges related to our moorestown facility 
the charge in first quarter of fiscal also includes severance costs related to several employees affected by the fourth quarter fiscal workforce reduction who were placed on transition programs and whose employment was terminated in the first quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal we recorded an additional restructuring charge related to the consolidation of our moorestown facility of million 
the charge was based on a revised lower estimate of future sublease income and a lease termination fee 
we may need to take similar actions in the future 
interest and other income  net the following table presents interest and other income  net in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent interest and other income  net interest income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to declining interest rates during the year 
income tax expense income tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal versus an income tax expense of million in fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from a million benefit from the new refundable federal 
table of contents research and development credit and a million benefit from the reversal of the accumulated deferred tax liability recognized from the impairment of the indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result of incurring substantial net operating losses  we determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
therefore  in accordance with the requirements of fasb  we maintain a full valuation allowance 
if we generate sustained future taxable income against which these tax attributes may be applied  some or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed 
if the valuation allowance were reversed  a portion would be recorded as an increase to paid in capital and the remainder would be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense

in process research and development in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded in process research and development expense of million which was charged to expense because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses for the acquired technology existed at the time of acquisition 
the estimated fair value of the purchased in process research and development was determined using a discounted cash flow model  based on a discount rate which took into consideration the stage of completion and risks associated with developing the technology 
restructuring and related impairments during the first quarter of  we completed a consolidation of our moorestown  new jersey facility and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this consolidation was completed in conjunction with the decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce our workforce across the company

our primary source of liquidity comes from our cash  cash equivalents and investments  which totaled million at july  our investments are classified as available for sale and consist of securities that are readily convertible to cash  including certificates of deposits and government securities 
at july   million of investments with maturities of less than one year were classified as short term investments 
based on our current expectations  we anticipate that some portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments may be consumed by operations 
our accounts receivable  while not considered a primary source of liquidity  represent a concentration of credit risk because the accounts receivable balance at any point in time typically consists of a relatively small number of customer account balances 
at july   more than of our accounts receivable balance was attributable to five of our customers 
as of july   we do not have any outstanding debt or credit facilities  and do not anticipate entering into any debt or credit agreements in the foreseeable future 
our fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases and inventory purchase commitments

table of contents as of july  we had accrued restructuring costs of million that will be paid over the next year 
in the aggregate  restructuring payments of approximately million  including the previously discussed anticipated first quarter of fiscal charges of million  will be paid over the next year 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we will continue to consider appropriate action with respect to our cash position in light of the present and anticipated business needs as well as providing a means by which our shareholders may realize value in connection with their investment 
commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at july   our future contractual obligations  which consist of contractual commitments for operating leases and inventory and other purchase commitments  were as follows in thousands total less than year years years thereafter operating leases inventory and other purchase commitments total payments made under operating leases will be accounted for as rent expense for the facilities currently being utilized  or as a reduction of the restructuring liability for payments relating to excess facilities 
payments made for inventory purchase commitments will initially be capitalized as inventory  and will subsequently be charged to cost of revenue as the inventory is sold or otherwise disposed of

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our current investment activities is to preserve investment principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities which may include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds and government debt securities 
these available for sale investments are subject to interest rate risk and may decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates increased immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at july   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
exchange rate sensitivity while the majority of our operations are based in the united states  our business is global  with international revenue representing of total revenue in fiscal we expect that international sales may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
generally  sales outside of the united states are denominated in us dollars 
in the future  to the extent that sales outside of the united states might be denominated in local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our financial results  although to date such impact has not been material 
we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currencies if the exposure is material  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date
