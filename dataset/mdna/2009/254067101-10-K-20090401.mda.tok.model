in august of  we purchased the remaining interest in cdi contractors  llc and cdi contractors  inc cdi  a former equity method joint venture investment of the company that is also a general contractor that constructs stores for the company  creating a reportable segment separate from our retail operations 
our retail stores are located in fashion oriented shopping malls and open air centers and offer a broad selection of fashion apparel and home furnishings 
we offer an appealing and attractive assortment of merchandise to our customers at a fair price 
we offer national brand merchandise as well as our exclusive brand merchandise 
we seek to enhance our income by maximizing the sale of this merchandise to our customers by promoting and advertising our merchandise and by making our stores an attractive and convenient place for our customers to shop 
in accordance with the national retail federation fiscal reporting calendar  the and reporting periods presented and discussed below ended january  and february   respectively  and each contained weeks 
the corresponding reporting period ended february  contained weeks 
for comparability purposes  where noted  some of the information discussed below is based upon comparison of the weeks ended january  and february  to the corresponding period ended january  fiscal the dramatic economic decline during fiscal had a significant impact on our results of operations and caused us to take aggressive action 
net sales from retail operations were  million during fiscal  a decrease of million or from fiscal the significant slowdown in consumer spending  especially in the second half of  had a negative impact on net sales 
gross profit from retail operations  as a percentage of net sales  decreased basis points  primarily due to higher markdown activity 
in anticipation of the weakened economy  we purchased substantially less inventory for the fall season 
the combined efforts of

index to financial statements increasing markdowns and controlling purchases helped bring inventory levels down in comparable stores  despite softer sales 
we took extensive cost reduction measures  lowering advertising  selling  administrative and general expenses by million compared to last year 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million during the year related to underperforming stores 
all of our cost saving measures  however  could not offset the erosion of our gross margin and the effects of the asset impairment charges  and the company recorded a net loss of million  or per share  compared to net income of million or per share in the prior year 
as of january   we had working capital of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and  million of total debt outstanding 
cash flows from operating activities were million for fiscal we operated total stores as of january   a decrease of from last year  the company closed underperforming stores and opened new stores during the year 
at january   we had availability of approximately million under our billion revolving credit facility that expires december  key performance indicators we use a number of key indicators of financial condition and operating performance to evaluate the performance of our business  including the following fiscal year ended january  february  february  net sales in millions sales per square foot total store count at end of period net sales trend comparable store sales trend gross profit in millions gross profit as a percentage of net sales comparable store inventory trend merchandise inventory turnover cash flow from operations in millions retail segment only  excluding cash flow data weeks trends and uncertainties we have identified the following key uncertainties whose fluctuations may have a material effect on our operating results 
cash flow cash from operating activities is a primary source of liquidity that is adversely affected when the industry faces economic challenges 
furthermore  operating cash flow can be negatively affected when new and existing competitors seek areas of growth to expand their businesses 
pricing if our customers do not purchase our merchandise offerings in sufficient quantities  we respond by taking markdowns 
if we have to reduce our prices  the cost of goods sold on our income statement will correspondingly rise  thus reducing our income 
success of brand the success of our exclusive brand merchandise as well as merchandise we source from national vendors is dependent upon customer fashion preferences 
sourcing our store merchandise selection is dependent upon our ability to acquire compelling products from a number of sources 
our ability to attract and retain compelling vendors as well as

index to financial statements in house design talent combined with adequate and stable availability of materials and production facilities from which we source our merchandise has a significant impact on our merchandise mix and  thus  our ability to sell merchandise at profitable prices 
store growth although store growth is presently not a near term goal  such growth is dependent upon a number of factors which could impede our ability to open new stores  such as the identification of suitable markets and locations and the availability of shopping developments  especially in a weakened economic environment 
seasonality and inflation our business  like many other retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of each fiscal year due to the holiday season 
because of the seasonality of our business  results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results during the periods presented  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by such factors in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in this note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results will differ from those estimates 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventory 
approximately of the inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail last in  first out lifo inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
the remaining of the inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the specific identified cost method 
a change in markdowns would have impacted net income by approximately million for the year ended january  the company regularly records a provision for estimated shrinkage  thereby reducing the carrying value of merchandise inventory 
complete physical inventories of all of the company s stores and warehouses are performed no less frequently than annually  with the recorded amount of merchandise inventory being adjusted to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements coincide with these physical counts 
the differences between the estimated amounts of shrinkage and the actual amounts realized have been insignificant 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue upon the sale of merchandise to its customers  net of anticipated returns 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of our return rate 
we recorded an allowance for sales returns of million and million as of january  and february   respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision have been insignificant for the years ended january   february  and february  the company s share of income earned under the long term marketing and servicing alliance with ge involving the dillard s branded proprietary credit cards is included as a component of service charges and other income 
the company received income of approximately million  million and million from ge in  and  respectively 
further pursuant to this agreement  the company has no continuing involvement other than to honor the proprietary cards in its stores 
although not obligated to a specific level of marketing commitment  the company participates in the marketing of the proprietary cards and accepts payments on the proprietary cards in its stores as a convenience to customers who prefer to pay in person rather than by mailing their payments to ge 
revenue from cdi construction contracts are generally recognized by applying percentages of completion for each period to the total estimated revenue for the respective contracts 
the length of contract varies but is typically nine to eighteen months 
the percentages of completion are determined by relating the actual costs of work performed to date to the current estimated total costs of the respective contracts 
merchandise vendor allowances 
the company receives concessions from its merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  payroll reimbursements and margin maintenance programs 
cooperative advertising allowances are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would likely consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising  which could increase or decrease our expenditures 
similarly  we are not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenues  as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for our stores 
payroll reimbursements are reported as a reduction of payroll expense in the period in which the reimbursement occurred 
amounts of margin maintenance allowances are recorded only when an agreement has been reached with the vendor and the collection of the concession is deemed probable 
all such merchandise margin maintenance allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost purchases 
under the retail method of accounting for inventory  a portion of these allowances reduces cost of goods sold and a portion reduces the carrying value of merchandise inventory 
the amounts recognized as a reduction in cost of sales have not varied significantly over the past three fiscal years 
insurance accruals 
the company s consolidated balance sheets include liabilities with respect to self insured workers compensation with a self insured retention of million per claim and general liability with a self insured retention of million per claim claims 
the company estimates the required liability of such claims  utilizing an actuarial method  based upon various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience  projected loss development factors  actual payroll and other data 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon the changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and changes in the ultimate cost per incident severity 
as of january  and february   insurance accruals of million and million  respectively  were recorded in trade 
table of contents 
index to financial statements accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
adjustments resulting from changes in historical loss trends have reduced expenses during the years ended january  and february   partially due to new company programs that have helped decrease both the number and cost of claims 
further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
a change in our self insurance reserve would have affected net earnings by million for the fiscal year ended january  finite lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or store closings 
the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or the company s strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill annually as of the last day of the fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using projected discounted cash flows and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions 
these estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management 
this approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and a terminal growth rate 
income taxes 
temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management s estimations  interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if the company s actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  new store locations or tax planning  the company s effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of january  and february  was million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  would  if recognized  affect the effective tax rate 
the total amount of accrued interest and penalties as of january  and february  was million and million  respectively 
the company classifies interest expense and penalties relating to income tax in the financial statements as income tax expense 
during fiscal  the internal revenue service completed its examination of the company s federal income tax returns for the fiscal tax years through certain issues relating to this examination are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements currently under appeal 
the company is also under examination by various state and local taxing jurisdictions for various fiscal years 
the tax years that remain subject to examination for major tax jurisdictions are fiscal tax years and forward  with the exception of fiscal through amended state and local tax returns related to the reporting of federal audit adjustments 
at this time  the company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the company has taken positions in certain taxing jurisdictions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within the next twelve months 
the possible decrease could result from the finalization of the company s federal and various state income tax audits 
the company s federal income tax audit uncertainties primarily relate to research and development credits  while various state income tax audit uncertainties primarily relate to income from intangibles 
the estimated range of the reasonably possible uncertain tax benefit decrease in the next twelve months is between million and million 
changes in the company s assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
discount rate 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on the citigroup high grade corporate yield curve on its annual measurement date and is matched to the future expected cash flows of the benefit plans by annual periods 
the discount rate had increased to as of january  from as of february  we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the pension liability of million is appropriately stated as of january   however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a further basis point change in the discount rate would generate an experience gain or loss of approximately million 
we adopted sfas no

the net sales decrease reflected a decrease in the number of sales transactions while the average dollars per sales transaction remained flat 
we believe sales in all categories were affected by the decline in the general economic environment 
we are continuing to focus on our execution of merchandise mix and levels in order to improve performance 
the current slowdown in the united states economy will have an adverse affect on consumer confidence and consumer spending habits  which will result in both reduced customer traffic and comparable store sales 
the decline in revenue may have a resultant increase in inventory levels and markdowns 
these negative economic conditions may also affect future profitability and may cause us to recognize additional impairment or to reduce the number of stores in operation

management believes that recent expense saving initiatives from store closures could provide additional operating expense savings of approximately million in compared to sg a decreased million during fiscal compared to fiscal despite an increase as a percentage of sales due to a lack of sales leverage 
the dollar decline between the two periods was primarily as a result of a million charge in the prior year for a preliminary settlement agreement reached in a lawsuit filed on behalf of a putative class of former mercantile stores pension plan participants

the company received income of approximately million and million from ge in fiscal and while future cash flows under this alliance are difficult to predict  the company expects the amounts to be reduced from current year levels due to the challenging economy 
the amount the company receives is dependent on the level of sales on ge accounts  the level of balances carried on the ge accounts by ge customers  payment rates on ge accounts  finance charge rates and other fees on ge accounts  the level of credit losses for the ge accounts as well as ge s funding costs 
the alliance expires in fiscal net cash flows from operations increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million related to changes in working capital items  primarily of changes in inventory as the company worked to control inventory levels  including a decrease in purchases over the prior year  and of changes in accounts payable
