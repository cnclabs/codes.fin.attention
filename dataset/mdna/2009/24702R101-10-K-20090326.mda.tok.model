item a risk factors there are many risk factors that affect our business and results of operations  some of which are beyond our control 
the following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ substantially from those we currently expect or desire 
weakening global economic conditions and instability in financial markets could harm our business and result in reduced net revenue and profitability 
we are a global company with customers in virtually every business and industry 
there has been an erosion of global consumer confidence amidst concerns over declining asset values  fluctuating energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  rising unemployment  and the stability and solvency of financial institutions  financial markets  businesses  and sovereign nations 
these concerns have slowed global economic growth and have resulted in recessions in many countries  including the us while these global economic issues persist  there are likely to be a number of follow on effects on our business  including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying their technology investments  insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  counterparty failures negatively impacting our treasury operations  the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products  and customer insolvencies  all of which could reduce demand for our product and services  impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables  lengthen our cash conversion cycle and negatively impact liquidity  and ultimately decrease our net revenue and profitability 
weakening economic conditions and instability in financial markets could harm our financial services activities 
our financial services activities are negatively affected in four major ways by the current economic environment spending softness  increasing loan delinquencies and defaults  increasing funding costs  and reduced availability of funding through securitizations 
decreased customer spending directly reduces the potential sales revenue that we can seek to finance 
loan delinquencies and defaults impact our net credit losses and have been increasing for more than a year 
if this trend continues  we may need to increase our reserves in our customer receivables in the future 
the debt and securitization markets have been experiencing and may continue to experience 
table of contents extreme volatility and disruption  resulting in higher credit spreads in the capital markets and higher funding costs for us  as well as reduced availability of funding from securitizing our financing receivables 
we have continued to utilize securitizations to fund our financing activities 
during fiscal and fiscal  dell transferred billion and billion  respectively  of fixed term leases and loans and revolving loans to unconsolidated qualified special purpose entities to facilitate the funding of financing receivables in the capital markets 
deterioration in our business performance  a credit rating downgrade  continued volatility in the securitization markets  or adverse changes in the economy could lead to reductions in debt availability for the qualified special purpose entities and could limit our ability to continue asset securitizations or other financing from debt or capital sources  reduce the amount of financing receivables that we originate  or could adversely affect the costs or terms on which we may be able to obtain capital  which could unfavorably affect our profitability or cash flows 
we face strong competition  which may adversely affect our market share  revenue  and profitability 
we operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware  software and service offerings  and face aggressive product and price competition from both branded and generic competitors 
we compete based on our ability to profitably offer competitive solutions with the most current and desired product features  as well as on customer service  quality and reliability 
we expect that competition will continue to be intense and that our competitors products may be less costly  provide better performance or include additional features 
our efforts to balance our mix of products and services to optimize profitability  liquidity  and growth may also put pressure on our industry unit share position in the short term 
as we continue to expand globally  we may see new and increased competition in different geographic regions 
in addition  barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost 
if our increasing reliance on third party original equipment manufacturers  original design manufacturing partnerships  and manufacturing outsourcing relationships fails to generate cost efficiencies  our profitability could be adversely impacted 
our profitability is also affected by our ability to negotiate favorable pricing with our vendors  including vendor rebates  marketing funds  and other vendor funding 
because these supplier negotiations are continuous and reflect the ongoing competitive environment  the variability in timing and amount of incremental vendor discounts and rebates can affect our profitability 
our inability to establish a cost and product advantage  or determine alternative means to deliver value to our customers  may adversely affect our market share  revenue  and profitability 
our ability to generate substantial non us net revenue faces many additional risks and uncertainties 
sales outside the us accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenue in fiscal our future growth rates and success are dependent on continued growth outside the us  including the key developing countries of brazil  russia  india  and china 
our international operations face many risks and uncertainties  including varied local economic and labor conditions  political instability  and changes in the regulatory environment  trade protection measures  tax laws including us taxes on foreign operations  copyright levies  and foreign currency exchange rates 
any of these factors could adversely affect our operations and profitability 
our profitability may be affected by our product  customer  and geographic sales mix and by seasonal sales trends 
our profit margins vary among products  customers  and geographies 
in addition  our business is subject to certain seasonal sales trends 
for example  sales to government customers particularly the us federal government are typically stronger in our third fiscal quarter  sales in emea are often weaker in our third fiscal quarter  and consumer sales are typically strongest during our fourth fiscal quarter 
as a result of these factors  our overall profitability for any particular period will be affected by the mix of products  customers  and geographies reflected in our sales for that period  as well as by seasonal trends 
infrastructure failures and breaches in data security could harm our business 
we depend on our information technology and manufacturing infrastructure to achieve our business objectives 
if a problem  such as a computer virus  intentional disruption by a third party  natural disaster  manufacturing failure  telecommunications system failure  or lost connectivity impairs our infrastructure  we may be unable to book or process orders  manufacture  ship in a timely manner  or otherwise carry on our business 
an infrastructure disruption could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and revenue  result in the unintentional disclosure of company or customer information  and require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related data security concerns 
the harm to our business could be even greater if it occurs during a period of disproportionately heavy demand 
our inability to effectively manage product and services transitions could reduce the demand for our products and the profitability of our operations 
continuing improvements in technology mean frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles  and improvement in product performance characteristics 
in addition  we are increasingly sourcing new products and transitioning existing products through our original design manufacturing partnerships and manufacturing outsourcing relationships in order to generate cost efficiencies  deliver products faster and better serve our customers in certain segments and geographical areas 
these product 
table of contents transitions present execution challenges and risks 
if we are unable to effectively manage a new product transition  our business and results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to successfully transform our sales capability and to add to the scope of our product and services offerings 
our growth strategy involves reaching more customers worldwide through new distribution channels  such as consumer retail  expanding our relationships with value added resellers  and augmenting select areas of our business through targeted acquisitions 
our goal continues to be to optimize the balance of liquidity  profitability  and growth with a focus on moving the weight of the product portfolio to higher margin products and recurring revenue streams 
our ability to grow sales of these higher margin products  services and solutions depends on our ability to successfully transition our sales capabilities and add to the breadth of our higher margin offerings through selective acquisitions 
if we are unable to effectively transition our sales capabilities and grow our product and services offerings  our business and results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
disruptions in component or product availability could unfavorably affect our performance 
our manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies give us the ability to operate with reduced levels of component and finished goods inventories 
our financial success is partly due to our supply chain management practices  including our ability to achieve rapid inventory turns 
because we maintain minimal levels of component and product inventories  a disruption in component or product availability could harm our financial performance and our ability to satisfy customer needs 
our reliance on vendors for products and components creates risks and uncertainties 
we require a high volume of quality products and components from third party vendors 
in addition  we are continuing to expand our use of original design manufacturing partnerships and manufacturing outsourcing relationships in order to generate cost efficiencies  deliver products faster and better serve our customers in certain segments and geographical areas 
our increasing reliance on these vendors subjects us to a greater risk of shortages  and reduced control over delivery schedules of components and products which can harm efficiencies  as well as a greater risk of increases in product and component costs which can harm our profitability 
in addition  defective parts and products from these vendors could reduce product reliability and harm our reputation 
we could experience manufacturing interruptions  delays  or inefficiencies if we are unable to timely and reliably procure components and products from single source or limited source suppliers 
we maintain several single source or limited source supplier relationships  either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance  quality  support  delivery  capacity  or price considerations 
if the supply of a critical single or limited source product or component is delayed or curtailed  we may not be able to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner 
even where multiple sources of supply are available  qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales  which could harm operating results 
our business is increasingly dependent on our ability to access the capital markets 
we are increasingly dependent on access to debt and capital sources to provide financing for our customers and to obtain funds in the us for general corporate purposes  including share repurchases  funding customer receivables  and acquisitions 
additionally  we have customer financing relationships with companies whose business models rely on accessing the capital markets 
the inability of these companies to access such markets could force us to self fund transactions or forgo customer financing opportunities  potentially harming our financial performance 
the debt and capital markets have been experiencing and may continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption 
these issues  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk  and the current weak economic conditions have made  and will likely continue to make  it difficult to obtain funding 
the cost of accessing debt and capital markets has increased as many lenders and institutional investors require higher rates of return 
lenders have also tightened lending standards  and reduced or ceased their lending to certain borrowers 
we believe that we will be able to obtain appropriate financing from third parties even in light of the current market conditions  nevertheless  changes in our credit ratings  deterioration in our business performance  or adverse changes in the economy could limit our ability to obtain financing from debt or capital sources or could adversely affect the terms on which we may be able to obtain capital  which could unfavorably affect our net revenue and profitability 
see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital commitments liquidity 
we face risks relating to our internal controls 
if management is not successful in maintaining a strong internal control environment  material weaknesses could reoccur  causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
this could lead to a decline in our stock price  limit our ability to access the capital markets in the future  and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures 

table of contents unfavorable results of legal proceedings could harm our business and result in substantial costs 
we are involved in various claims  suits  investigations  and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business and that are not yet resolved  including those that are set forth under note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii
