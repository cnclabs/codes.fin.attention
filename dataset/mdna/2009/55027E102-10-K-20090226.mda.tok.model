table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included below in item and risk factors included above in item a of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we develop  manufacture and sell proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industries 
our xmap technology  an open architecture  multiplexing technology  allows simultaneous analysis of up to bioassays from a small sample volume  typically a single drop of fluid  by reading biological tests on the surface of microscopic polystyrene beads called microspheres 
products we are currently developing and that are anticipated for market release in will be able to perform up to simultaneous bioassays from a small sample volume 
xmap technology combines this miniaturized liquid array bioassay capability with small lasers  digital signal processors and proprietary software to create a system offering advantages in speed  precision  flexibility and cost 
our xmap technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry which includes the fields of drug discovery and development  clinical diagnostics  genetic analysis  bio defense  protein analysis and biomedical research 
our end user customers and partners  which include laboratory professionals performing research  clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by a physician and other laboratories  have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible 
luminex has adopted a business model built around strategic partnerships 
we have licensed our xmap technology to companies  which then develop products that incorporate the xmap technology into products that they sell to the end user 
luminex develops and manufactures the proprietary xmap laboratory instrumentation and the proprietary xmap microspheres and sells these products to its partners 
our partners then sell xmap instrumentation and xmap based reagent consumable products  which run on the instrumentation  to the end user laboratory 
luminex was founded on this model  and our success to date has been due to this model 
as of december   luminex had approximately strategic partners and these partners have purchased from luminex over  xmap based systems 
of the strategic partners  have released commercialized reagent based products utilizing our technology 
beginning in  we began developing proprietary assays through lbg 
this development was supplemented in by our acquisition of tm bioscience 
our assay segment focuses on the molecular diagnostics market 
luminex has several forms of revenue that result from this partner model system revenue is generated from the sale of our xmap systems and peripherals 
currently  system revenue is derived from the sale of the luminex and analyzers  our flexmap d system  optional xy platform and sheath delivery systems 
consumable revenue is generated from the sale of our dyed polystyrene microspheres and sheath fluid 
our larger commercial and development partners often purchase these consumables in bulk to minimize the number of incoming qualification events and to allow for longer development and production runs 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells a kit incorporating our proprietary microspheres to an end user or when a partner utilizes a kit to provide a testing result to a user 
end users can be facilities such as testing labs  development facilities and research facilities that buy prepared kits and have specific testing needs or testing service companies that provide assay results to pharmaceutical research companies or physicians 
assay revenue is generated from the sale of our kits which are a combination of chemical and biological reagents and our proprietary bead technology used to perform diagnostic and research assays on samples 
assay revenue includes revenue from lmd since the effective date our acquisition of lmd on march  assay revenue generated from lbg is also classified here 
prior to our forming the assay segment  assay revenue generated from lbg was recorded in other revenue as it did not constitute a material amount of total revenue 

table of contents service revenue is generated when a partner or other owner of a system purchases a service contract from us after the warranty has expired 
service contract revenue is amortized over the life of the contract and the costs associated with those contracts are recognized as incurred 
other revenue consists of items such as training  shipping  parts sales  license revenue  grant revenue  contract research and development fees and milestone revenue and other items that individually amount to less than of total revenue 
highlights luminex grew total revenue by approximately to million over revenue gross margin percentage of  up from in delivered first commercial shipments of new instrument  flexmap d record system shipments of for the year ended december   including three flexmap d shipments cumulative world wide system sales to date of  systems  including three flexmap d placements for the year ended  royalty revenue increased and consumables revenue increased over the prior calendar year change in cash position our cash  cash equivalents and investments increased by approximately million during the twelve months ended december  due primarily to our secondary public offering of  shares which raised net proceeds of million and closed on june  and our management of receivables and inventory 
in addition  we secured a revolving credit facility for up to million  which  as of december  and subject to the borrowing base requirements  would have allowed for borrowings of up to approximately million 
we elected not to renew this credit facility as it matured on february   given our significant cash  cash equivalents  and investment balance and in light of our projected capital needs for the foreseeable future 
segment information luminex has two reportable segments the technology segment and the assay segment 
the technology segment  which is our base business  consists of system sales to partners  raw bead sales  royalties  service and support of the technology  and other miscellaneous items 
the assay segment consists of lbg and lmd 
this segment is primarily involved in the development and sale of assays on xmap technology for use on luminex s installed base of systems 
future operations we expect anticipated revenue growth to be driven by sustained adoption of our core technology coupled with assay introduction and commercialization by the assay segment 
the anticipated continued shift in revenue concentration towards higher margin items  such as assays  consumables and royalties  should provide favorable gross margins 
additionally  we believe that a sustained investment in r d is necessary in order to meet the needs of our marketplace  however  we estimate that r d expenditures for will decline as a percentage of revenue from towards our long term target of of revenue 
we expect our primary challenges to be the continued adoption of partner products incorporating luminex technology  the current economic conditions and its potential impact on the purchase and sales of our partners and customers and our ability to improve or maintain on operating margins  commercialization  regulatory acceptance and market adoption of output from the assay segment and expanding our footprint and reputation within our identified target market segments 

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements  and the judgments and estimates involved under each 
we also have other significant accounting policies that do not involve critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective 
these are described in note of our consolidated financial statements provided herein in item estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
if the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment  the revenue is deferred until all criteria are met 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our technology  provides testing services to third parties using our technology or resells our consumables 
royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us by our partners  generally quarterly  therefore  the underlying end user sales may be related to prior periods due to the timing of when the revenue is reported to us by our partners 
we also sell extended service contracts for maintenance and support of our products 
revenue for service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenues from contracts with multiple elements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and when the amount is not contingent upon delivery of the undelivered elements 
upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or applied against royalty payments 
nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue over the estimated life of the license agreements 
grant revenue consists of amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory are i a specific reserve for inventory items that we no longer use in the manufacture of our products or that no longer meet our specifications and ii a reserve against slow moving items for potential obsolescence 
the total estimated allowance is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
while management believes that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  scientific and technological advances will continue and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
however  we do not believe this estimate is subject to significant variability 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
while management believes that adequate reserve has been made in the consolidated financial statements for product warranties  should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
however  we do not believe this estimate is subject to significant variability 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses historically have been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our significant customers  or a further deterioration in the economic environment  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
however  we do not believe this estimate is subject to significant variability 

table of contents purchase price allocation  intangibles and goodwill 
the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently if there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
we would recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
determining the fair value of goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
as of december   we have million of goodwill  which has been allocated to the assay segment which includes lmd 
we have performed our annual test of goodwill  and have determined there has been no impairment of goodwill as of december  accounting for income taxes 
we calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  judgment is required 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical income  projected future income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
stock compensation 
we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the consolidated statement of income in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected volatility  expected term and risk free rate of return 
calculation of expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term is calculated using the contractual term of the options as well as an analysis of the company s historical exercises of stock options 
the estimate of risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  thus we have assumed a dividend yield 
as part of the requirements of sfas r  we are required to estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust compensation cost recorded accordingly 
the estimate of forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture performance and will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 

table of contents consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenue of certain items in the consolidated statements of operations

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the gross profit margin rate gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was for the year ended december   up from the year ended december  the increase in gross margin rate was primarily attributable to the continuing shift in revenue concentration towards higher margin items such as assays  consumables and royalties 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the overall increase in revenue 
we anticipate continued fluctuation in gross profit margin and related gross profit primarily as a result of variability in partner bulk purchases and the absolute number of quarterly system sales 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to incorporation of the results of lmd for the full twelve months in compared to the inclusion of only ten months of operating results of lmd in the year ended december   as the acquisition was consummated on march   and to a lesser extent  to increased activity by the assay segment related to product development  an increase in materials  and additional personnel costs associated with the addition of employees and contract employees 
research and development headcount at december  was as compared to at december  as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense decreased to in as compared with in our current expectation is for research and development expenses to be between and of total revenue for selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to incorporation of the results of lmd for the full twelve months in compared to the inclusion of only ten months of operating results of lmd in the year ended december   and to a lesser extent additional personnel costs associated with the addition of employees and an increase in stock compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative headcount at december  was as compared to at december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses reduced to in as compared to in other income  net 
other income  net decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  partially due to approximately  in costs related to a potential acquisition that did not occur  offset by the interest income on the net proceeds from our secondary offering 
in addition  the average rate earned on current invested balances decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease in the average rate earned is the result of an overall decrease in market rates compared to the prior year period

at december   we held cash and cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments  of million and had working capital of million 
cash  cash equivalents and investments have increased by approximately million during the year ended december  due primarily to the cash proceeds from our secondary public offering in june of of million and cash provided from operations of million 
we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities in conjunction with an initial public offering in  subsequent option exercises  and our secondary public offering in and cash generated from operations 
our cash reserves are held directly or indirectly in a variety of short term  interest bearing instruments  including obligations of the united states government or agencies thereof and united states corporate debt securities 
we do not have any investments in asset backed commercial paper  auction rate securities  or mortgage backed or sub prime style investments 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  significant items affecting operating cash flows for the period were our net income of million and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million and stock compensation of million  offset by an increase in inventory of million 
other income decreased due to expenditures of approximately  in the year ended december  related to a potential acquisition that did not occur  and were consequently reflected as an investing activity rather than an operating activity 
our operating expenses during the year ended december  were million  of which million was research and development expense and million was selling  general and administrative expense 
while research and development expense as a percentage of revenue decreased in to from in and is expected to continue to decrease  we expect the absolute dollars of research and development expense to scale with our revenue growth as a result of our continuing investment in the research and development pipeline to support our strategy and expanded focus on product and platform development

currently  exclusive of changes in investments  we expect cash used in investing activities to be primarily for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared with cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  due to our secondary public offering in june of of million and proceeds from issuance of common stock due to exercises of stock options and warrants of million in compared to million in we expect research and development expense as a percent of revenue to be between and of total revenue in while the percentage is expected to decrease  we expect research and development expenses in absolute dollars to scale with our revenue growth as a result of our continuing investment in the research and development pipeline to support our strategy and expanded focus on product and platform development 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in  excluding the impact of foreign exchange on foreign denominated balances  to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as in the prior year as management believes it can leverage the current level of expenses to adequately support the ongoing growth of our business 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the need to acquire licenses to new technology  costs associated with strategic acquisitions including integration costs and assumed liabilities  litigation expense  the status of competitive products and potential cost associated with both protecting and defending our intellectual property 
additionally  actions taken as a result of the ongoing internal evaluation of our business could result in expenditures not currently contemplated in our estimates for we believe  however  that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our operating expenses  capital equipment requirements and other expected liquidity requirements for the coming twelve months 
based upon our current operating plan and structure  management believes luminex will have sufficient capital to fund operations through december  factors that could affect our capital requirements  in addition to those listed above  include i continued collections of accounts receivable consistent with our historical experience  ii our ability to manage our inventory levels consistent with past practices  and iii signing of partnership agreements which include significant up front license fees

on march   we entered into a senior revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na  which provided borrowings of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of million based on availability under a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts and inventory 
the obligations under the senior revolving credit facility were guaranteed by our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and secured by all of our and the guarantors accounts  equipment inventory and general intangibles excluding intellectual property  and the guarantors including the pledge of an intercompany note from lmd and payable to luminex 
loans under the senior credit facility accrued interest on the basis of either a base rate or a libor rate 
the base rate was calculated daily and was the greater of i prime minus and ii federal funds rate plus 
borrowings at the libor rate were based on one  two or three month periods and interest was calculated by taking the sum of i the product of libor for such period and statutory reserves plus ii 
we paid a fee of per annum on the unfunded portion of the lender s aggregate commitment under the facility 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the senior revolving credit facility  and approximately million was available for borrowing 
this credit facility had a maturity of february  we elected not to renew this credit facility given our significant cash  cash equivalents  and investment balance and in light of our projected capital needs for the foreseeable future 

table of contents the senior credit facility contained conditions to making loans  representations  warranties and covenants  including financial covenants customary for a transaction of this type 
financial covenants included i a tangible net worth covenant of million and ii a liquidity requirement of availability not less than the funded debt of luminex and its subsidiaries calculated using the unencumbered cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of us and our guarantors including lmd 
the senior credit facility also contained customary events of default as well as restrictions on undertaking certain specified corporate actions  including  among others  asset dispositions  acquisitions and other investments  dividends  fundamental corporate changes such as mergers and consolidations  incurrence of additional indebtedness  creation of liens and negative pledges  transactions with affiliates and agreements as to certain subsidiary restrictions and the creation of additional subsidiaries 
if an event of default occurred that was not otherwise waived or cured  the lender may have terminated its obligations to make loans under the senior credit facility and may have declared the loans then outstanding under the senior credit facility to be due and payable 
we believe we were in compliance with our financial and other covenants under the senior credit facility 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and deployment of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all  particularly given the current state of the capital markets 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   we had approximately million in non cancelable obligations for the next months 
these obligations are included in our estimated cash usage during the following table reflects our total current non cancelable obligations by period as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years non cancelable rental obligations non cancelable purchase obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations total purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders primarily as a result of normal inventory purchases or minimum payments due resulting when minimum purchase commitments are not met 
on december   lmd entered into an agreement with the ministry of industry of the government of canada under which the government agreed to invest up to canadian cdn million relating to the development of several genetic tests 
funds were advanced from technology partnerships canada tpc  a special operating program 
the actual payments we received were predicated on eligible expenditures made during the project period which ended july  lmd has received cdn million from tpc which is expected to be repaid along with approximately cdn million of imputed interest for a total of approximately cdn million 
lmd has agreed to repay the tpc funding through a royalty on revenues 
royalty payments commenced in at a rate of of total revenue and at a rate of for and thereafter 
aggregate royalty repayment will continue until total advances plus imputed interest has been repaid or until april   whichever is earlier 
the repayment obligation expires on april  and any unpaid balance will be cancelled and forgiven on that date 
should the term of repayment be shorter than expected due to higher than expected assay revenue  the effective interest rate would increase as repayment is accelerated 
repayments denominated in us dollars are currently projected to be as shown in the table above  but actual future sales generating a repayment obligation will vary from this projection and are subject to the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report  including under risk factors and safe harbor cautionary statement 
furthermore  payment reflected in us dollars is subject to adjustment based upon applicable exchange rates as of the reporting date 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with luminex s unrecognized tax benefits at december   luminex is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore   of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a direct adverse effect on our operations to date 
however  a substantial increase in product and manufacturing costs and personnel related expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the event these expenses increase at a faster pace than we can increase our system  consumable and royalty rates

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates  particularly since our investments are in short term and long term instruments held to maturity 
a basis point fluctuation from average investment returns at december  would yield an approximate variance in overall investment return 
due to our intention to hold our investments to maturity  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
our revolving credit facility also would have been affected by fluctuations in interest rates as it is based on prime minus or the federal funds effective rate in effect plus 
as of december   we had not drawn on this facility 
we elected not to renew this credit facility on february  foreign currency risk 
as of december   as a result of our foreign operations  we have costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily canadian dollars and to a lesser extent the euro 
for example  some fixed asset purchases  certain expenses  and the tpc debt of our canadian subsidiary  lmd  are denominated in canadian dollars while sales of products are primarily denominated in us dollars 
all transactions in our netherlands subsidiary are denominated in euros 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
a significant majority of our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
the impact of foreign exchange on foreign denominated balances will vary in relation to changes between the us and canadian dollar exchange rates 
a change in the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar could result in an immaterial foreign exchange impact 
as a result of our efforts to expand globally  in the future we will be exposed to additional foreign currency risk in multiple currencies  however  at this time  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is not material 
in addition  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 
for example  currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rates fluctuations could affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  we cannot give any assurance as to the effect that future changes in foreign currency rates will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our aggregate foreign currency transaction loss of  was included in determining our consolidated results for the year ended december
