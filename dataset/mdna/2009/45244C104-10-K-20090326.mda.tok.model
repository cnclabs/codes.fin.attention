item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview general 
we provide software based computer enabled detection  or ced  products and solutions that use advanced signal processing software algorithms to detect and monitor objects in a designated field of view 
our technology analyzes the signal from a sophisticated sensor and passes the information along to management systems  controllers or directly to users 
our core products  the autoscope video vehicle detection system and the rtms radar detection system  operate using our proprietary software in conjunction with video cameras or radar and commonly available electronic components 
each of these systems is used by traffic managers primarily to improve the flow of vehicle traffic and to enhance safety at intersections  main thoroughfares  freeways and tunnels 
autoscope systems are sold to distributors and end users of traffic management products in north america  the caribbean and latin america by econolite control products  inc  or econolite  our exclusive licensee in these regions 
we sell rtms systems to distributors and end users in north america 
we also sell both autoscope and rtms to distributors and end users in europe and asia through our european and hong kong subsidiaries  respectively 
end users of our products throughout the world are generally funded by government agencies responsible for traffic management or traffic law enforcement 
eis asset purchase 
on december   we purchased certain assets from eis electronic integrated systems inc  or eis  including its principal product line  the rtms system 
in its fiscal year ended september   eis had revenue of million  substantially all of which related to rtms sales 
our consolidated financial statements include revenue and expenses related to the operations of the former eis business from december  through december  trends and challenges in our business we believe recent growth in our business can be attributed primarily to the following global trends worsening traffic caused by increased numbers of vehicles in metropolitan areas without corresponding expansions of road infrastructure  which has increased demand for our products  advances in information technology  which have made our products easier to market and implement  the continuing rise in funding allocations in large cities for centralized traffic management services 
which has increased the ability of our primary end users to implement our products  and general increases in the cost effectiveness of electronics  which make our products more affordable for end users 
we believe our continued growth primarily depends upon continued adoption and governmental funding of intelligent transportation systems  or its  for traffic control in developed countries  countries in the developing world adopting above ground detection technology  such as video or radar  instead of in pavement loop technology to manage traffic  use of ced to provide solutions to security surveillance and environmental issues associated with increasing automobile use in metropolitan areas  and our ability to develop new products  such as hybrid ced devices incorporating  for example  radar and video technologies  that provide increasingly accurate information and enhance the end users ability to cost effectively manage traffic  security surveillance and environmental issues 
because our principal end users are governmental entities  we are faced with challenges related to potential delays in purchase decisions by those entities and changes in budgetary constraints 
these contingencies could result in significant fluctuations in our revenue between periods 
the current worldwide recession is further adding to the unpredictability of purchase decisions  creating more delays than usual and decreasing governmental budgets  and it is likely to negatively affect revenue 
we believe we may be a beneficiary of the federal stimulus bill enacted early in  but it is too early to determine the level of impact to our operations 
key financial terms and metrics revenue 
revenue historically has been derived from two sources royalties received from econolite for sales of the autoscope system in north america  the caribbean and latin america and revenue received from direct sales of autoscope systems in europe and asia 
royalties from econolite historically have provided the majority of our revenue 
we calculate the royalties using a profit sharing model where we split the gross profit on sales of autoscope product made through econolite 
this royalty arrangement has the benefit of decreasing our cost of revenues and our selling  marketing and product support expenses because these costs and expenses are borne primarily by econolite 
although this royalty model has a positive impact on our gross margin  it also negatively impacts our total revenue  which would be higher if all the sales made by econolite were made directly by us 
the royalty arrangement is exclusive under a long term agreement 
our acquisition of the rtms product line  which we assemble  gives us an additional source of revenue that we expect will significantly increase our overall revenue and lessen fluctuations in our revenue from period to period due to our ownership of more than one product line and the higher volumes it brings  notwithstanding normal seasonality 
cost of revenue 
there is no cost of revenue related to royalties  as virtually all manufacturing  warranty and related costs are incurred by econolite 
cost of revenue related to direct product sales consists primarily of the amount charged by our third party contractors to manufacture the autoscope and rtms hardware platforms  which is influenced mainly by the cost of electronic components 
the cost of revenue also includes logistics costs and estimated expenses for product warranties and inventory reserves 
the key metric that we follow is achieving certain gross margin percentages by geographic region 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses fall into three categories selling  marketing and product support  general and administrative  and research and development 
selling  marketing and product support expenses consist of various costs related to sales and support of our products  including salaries  benefits and commissions paid to our personnel  commissions paid to third parties  travel  trade show and advertising costs  second tier technical support for econolite  and general product support  where applicable 
general and administrative expenses consist of certain corporate and administrative functions that support the development and sales of our products and provide an infrastructure to support future growth 
general and administrative expenses reflect management  supervisory and staff salaries and benefits  legal and auditing fees  travel  rent and costs associated with being a public company  such as board of director fees  sarbanes oxley compliance  listing fees and annual reporting expenses 
research and development expenses consist mainly of salaries and benefits for our engineers and third party costs for consulting and prototyping 
we measure all operating expenses against our annually approved budget  which is developed with achieving a certain operating margin as a key focus 
also included in operating expenses is non cash expense for intangible asset amortization 
seasonality 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past due to the seasonality of our business 
our first quarter generally is the weakest due to weather conditions that make roadway construction more difficult in north america  europe and northern asia 
we expect such seasonality to continue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  our international revenues have a significant large project component  resulting in a varying revenue stream 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
history 
we were incorporated in the state of minnesota in december and began operations by pioneering the commercial application of wide area video vehicle detection for traffic management 
the technology underlying our products was initially developed at the university of minnesota 
in  the university was awarded a patent for that technology  which it exclusively licensed to us 
in  we sub licensed this technology to econolite  a leading manufacturer and seller of traffic control products in north america and the caribbean  to manufacture and distribute products incorporating the technology 
segments 
we currently operate in two reportable segments autoscope and rtms 
autoscope is our machine vision product line  and revenue consists of royalties all of which are received from econolite  as well as a portion of international sales 
rtms is our radar product line acquired in the eis asset purchase in december  and revenue consists of all north american sales and a portion of international sales 
all segment revenues are derived from external customers 
the following table sets forth selected financial information for each of the company s reportable segments for the year ended december  in thousands autoscope rtms total revenue depreciation amortization of intangible assets income before income taxes capital expenditures total assets results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of income data as a percent of total revenue and gross margin on international sales and royalties as a percentage of international sales and royalties  respectively 
year ended december  international sales north american sales royalties total revenue gross margin international sales gross margin north american sales gross margin royalties selling  marketing and product support general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles in process research and development income from operations income tax expense benefit net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
royalty income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in royalty income reflects the continued success of econolite s distribution of autoscope in the north american market 
north american sales  which are sales of rtms in north america  were million in international sales  which include both autoscope and rtms sales outside of north america  increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in international sales was mainly due to the addition of rtms but also reflects market gains for autoscope 
we acquired the rtms family of products in december gross margins for international sales increased to in from in the increase resulted mainly from the addition of rtms  which typically earns higher margins than autoscope  and to a lesser extent by a revenue mix shift to higher margin product in autoscope 
gross margins on royalty income remained consistent at in and we anticipate that gross margins for our international and north american sales will again be in the ranges of to in  while we expect royalty gross margins will be in selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the change related mostly to the addition of rtms related expenses and to a lesser extent to headcount additions in sales and product support 
we anticipate that selling  marketing and product support expense will increase both in terms of actual expense and as a percentage of revenue in as compared to as we invest in market expansion activities in eastern europe and asia and realize the impact of headcount additions made late in general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase in costs resulted mainly from the addition of rtms related expenses and increased professional services expenses  including the costs of our withdrawn follow on offering 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense will be flat in terms of actual expense in as compared to research and development expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase was directly related to the addition of rtms related expenses and headcount additions towards the end of the year 
we anticipate that research and development expense will increase both in terms of actual expense and as a percentage of revenue in as compared to as we invest in video radar hybrid solutions and tailored international offerings and realize the impact of headcount additions made late in amortization of intangibles expense was  in and reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the eis asset purchase 
assuming there are no changes to our intangible assets  we anticipate amortization expense will be  in other income decreased to  in from  in in  other income fell due to lower cash and investment balances  lower interest rates and interest expense on debt incurred for the eis asset purchase 
in  other income was mainly tax exempt interest income  which was partially offset by interest expense on bank debt incurred in december our income tax effective rate was in our income tax effective rate was not meaningful due to the significant in process research and development expense impact on pre tax book income coupled with federal tax credits that brought our position to a benefit 
we expect the effective rate in to be in the range of to 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
international sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase was a result of growing acceptance of autoscope products in both europe and asia  resulting in new customers 
royalty income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in royalty income reflects the continued success of econolite s distribution of autoscope in the north american market 
north american sales were  in north american sales represent sales of rtms products from the date of the eis asset purchase 
gross margins for international sales increased to in from in gross margins on royalty income increased to in from in international gross margins were positively impacted by a shift in product sales mix to higher margin products in versus royalty gross margins were positively impacted by the patent royalty we owed to the university of minnesota ending in the third quarter of selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the change related mostly to headcount additions and increased promotional expense for the autoscope terra product line launch 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase resulted mainly from a combination of headcount additions  higher stock option and bonus expenses and  to a lesser extent  increased audit  tax  legal and consulting fees 
research and development expense decreased to million or of total revenue in  down from million or of total revenue in the decrease was directly related to significant prototype material and consulting expenses incurred in accelerating technical efforts on our next generation autoscope terra product line in which did not carry into amortization of intangibles expense was  in and reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the eis asset purchase from december  to december  in process research and development expense was million in million net of tax 
this expense was a result of a purchase price allocation component related to the eis asset purchase and is one time in nature 
other income increased to  in from  in in  other income was mainly tax exempt interest income which was partially offset by interest expense on bank debt incurred in december our income tax effective rate was not meaningful in due to the significant in process research and development expense impact on pre tax book income coupled with federal tax credits that brought our position to a benefit 
our income tax effective rate was unusually low due to a number of federal and state adjustments 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in restricted short term investments  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash and in investments at december  as discussed below  our investments held at december  were auction rate securities that were redeemed or sold at par subsequent to year end 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the primary reasons for the change were the incremental net income increase in  significant increases in depreciation and amortization and stabilization of working capital related to the eis asset purchase 
we purchased million in investments  net of redemptions  in as opposed to selling million in investments  net of purchases  in we also repaid million in debt in we anticipate that average receivable collection days in will increase over but that it will not have a material impact on our liquidity 
our planned additions of property and equipment are discretionary  and we do not expect them to exceed historical levels in at december   we held million par value of investments comprised of auction rate securities  or ars 
in january  these ars were redeemed at par under a rights offering established in november by the broker dealer 
also in the fourth quarter of  we sold million of ars at par held through a different broker dealer 
after these two transactions  we no longer hold any ars 
in may  we entered into a financing arrangement with associated bank  national association  or associated bank  which replaced our loan agreements with wells fargo bank  na  including fully repaying those loans 
under the arrangement with associated bank  we entered into a revolving line of credit and a term loan 
the revolving line of credit provides for up to million at an annual interest rate equal to the greater of or libor plus  as reset from time to time by associated bank 
advances on the line of credit cannot exceed a borrowing base determined under a formula  which is a percentage of the amounts of ars and receivables 
the line of credit currently has million in borrowings outstanding and matures on may  the term loan is for million and has a fixed annual interest rate of 
repayment on the term loan is in equal monthly principal installments over a month period 
as collateral  associated bank has a first priority security interest in all of our assets  and we pledged all of our ars 
as a result of the new financing arrangement with associated bank  ars investments were restricted as pledged to associated bank 
in february  we fully repaid the term loan and outstanding balances on the revolving line of credit using the proceeds from our ars redemption 
we believe  on an ongoing basis  we have regular availability to draw a minimum of million on our line of credit based on qualifying assets 
in conjunction with our eis asset purchase  the sellers have an earn out arrangement over approximately three years 
the earn out is based on earnings from rtms sales less related cost of revenue and operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and it is calculated annually 
if the earnings are at target levels  the sellers would receive million annually  or million in total 
superior performance of the assets could lead to an earn out in excess of million  as the earn out is not capped 
earn out payments generally are due within three months of the end of an earn out period 
the first earn out period ran from december  to december  based on the results for rtms  the sellers of the rtms business  also known as the eis assets  are entitled to receive a million earnout payment  which is expected be paid in march the liability has been recorded on our balance sheet as of december   with an offsetting entry to increase goodwill 
if we are acquired or sell substantially all of our assets before december   we must pay eis million less earn out amounts previously paid as an acceleration of potential earn out payments under the eis asset purchase agreement 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   along with our million revolving line of credit and cash provided by operating activities  will satisfy our projected working capital needs  payments under the eis earn out  investing activities  and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with an unconsolidated entity  including special purpose and similar entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
beginning in  we entered into a number of currency hedging arrangements 
the purpose of the hedging was to lock in what we believe to be favorable rates on certain currencies and to increase our predictability on certain expenses at our foreign subsidiaries 
all hedging activity is intended to qualify for hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
we believe all contracts will be utilized to provide funds to cover operating expenses 
critical accounting policies goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
our recorded goodwill relates to our flow traffic subsidiary and assets purchased from eis 
goodwill for the eis asset purchase was recorded in december and is tested for impairment annually on october  beginning in the flow traffic goodwill is tested for impairment on december of each year 
we also reconcile the fair value of our business segments to market capitalization on december or during interim periods when our consolidated shareholders equity is similar to or exceeds our market capitalization 
the impairment tests require us to estimate the fair value of our subsidiary and then compare it to the carrying value of the subsidiary or the fair value of all business segments to shareholders equity for the entity test 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  further analysis is performed to determine if there is an impairment loss 
for flow traffic  we estimate the fair value by using a combination of the income approach  where fair value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of flow traffic  and the prior transactions in company stock method 
the future economic benefits are significantly dependent on sustaining revenue growth in our autoscope product line 
for the eis assets  we estimate fair value by using a combination of the income approach  where fair value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from the rtms product line  and the market valuation approach  where the business was compared to guideline public company price earning multiples with a significant weighting to companies in the traffic detection business 
the future economic benefits are mainly dependent on future revenue growth of the rtms product line 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of december   and if flow traffic and or the eis assets do not provide the future economic benefits we project  the fair value of these assets may become impaired  and we would need to record an impairment loss 
the fair value of all combined business segments was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis of future income 
the market value was determined by multiplying the sum of common shares outstanding at december  and outstanding in the money stock options as reduced using the treasury stock method  by our average share price in december  in total  our market capitalization  and adding to it a control premium 
in most industries  including ours  an acquiring entity typically is willing to pay more for a controlling interest than an investor would pay for a fractional  noncontrolling ownership interest 
for purposes of this analysis  we used a control premium of 
to determine the applicable control premium  we observed data derived from acquisitions and trading multiples of companies in our industry  in addition to overall data for companies operating in both the software and manufacturing industries 
we have concluded that the control premium is reasonable and supports the differential between our market capitalization and the estimated fair value of our combined business  and no impairment was recorded 
the analysis indicated the two values were close and therefore if our market capitalization were to decrease in even slightly from the level in december or if control premiums were to decrease  it is likely that we would need to recognize some level of impairment loss 
at december  and  our market capitalization exceeded our shareholders equity by a significant margin  and the reconciliation process described above was not performed for those years 
earn outs related to the eis asset purchase are recorded as additional goodwill in the year earned 
intangible assets are related to the eis asset purchase for trade names and technology and are amortized over their anticipated useful lives of five to eight years 
revenue recognition 
royalty income is recognized based upon a monthly royalty report provided to us by econolite 
this report is prepared by econolite based on its sales of products we developed and is based on sales delivered and accepted by its customers 
we recognize revenue from north american and international sales at the time of delivery and acceptance  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record provisions against sales revenue for estimated returns and allowances in the period when the related revenue is recorded based upon historical sales returns and changes in end user demands 
sales returns and warranty allowances are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance as deemed necessary based on our estimate of our future sources of taxable income and the expected timing of temporary difference reversals 
uncertain tax positions are recognized if the tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market and allowances have been made for obsolete  excess or unmarketable inventories based on estimated future usage or actual or anticipated product line changes
