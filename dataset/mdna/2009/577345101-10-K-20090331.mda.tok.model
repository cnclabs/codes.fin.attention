item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
overview of the company the company operates as a landholding and operating parent company for its principal subsidiaries  including maui pineapple company  ltd 
and kapalua land company  ltd 
our reportable segments are agriculture  resort and community development 
agriculture the agriculture segment primarily includes growing  packing  and marketing of fresh premium pineapple 
our fresh pineapple is sold under the brand names maui gold and hawaiian gold tm 
we also grow and market fresh organic pineapple 
through most of  we also processed canned our pineapple  which we sold under buyers private labels and to the united states government note to consolidated financial statements 
resort the resort segment includes our ongoing operations at the kapalua resort 
these operations include two championship golf courses  a tennis facility  a vacation rental program  and several retail outlets 
in late december  our new kapalua adventure center opened and in january our mountain outpost began operations 
in march  we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell the plantation golf course for million note to consolidated financial statements 
community development the community development segment includes our real estate entitlement  development  construction  sales and leasing activities 
this segment also includes the operations of kapalua realty company  a general brokerage real estate company  and public utilities commission regulated water and sewage transmission operations located within the kapalua resort 
beginning august   the community development segment includes our investment in bay holdings note to consolidated financial statements 
current developments in  all of our business segments were negatively affected by the global recession  the resulting uncertainty in the local  national and world economies  and the continuing turmoil in the financial and credit markets 
uncertainty about current global economic conditions caused consumers to postpone spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news and declines in income or asset values  which negatively impacted all three of our operating segments 
the economic turmoil and higher transportation costs resulted in reduced visitor counts to maui and to the state of hawaii  which negatively affected our resort segment  and also resulted in slower sales of  and increased potential default rates on the residential units at kapalua bay  which negatively affected our community development segment 
in our pineapple operations  high energy prices increased the cost of fertilizers  packaging and other materials  increased the cost of transporting fruit to markets  and increased the cost of transporting fruit  equipment and employees between our locations  all of which negatively impacted our agriculture segment 
in july  we announced the reduction of positions affecting jobs throughout our company  primarily in the pineapple operations 
we continued throughout the remainder of the year to seek additional areas to reduce cost and  in march  we began to implement staff and salary reductions affecting nearly all employees 

table of contents in  we incurred an operating loss of million and negative cash flow from operations of million 
in addition at the end of  million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit was scheduled to become due in november in march  we amended both our million revolving line of credit and our million revolving loan agreements in order to be in compliance with all covenants effective december  also in march  we sold the plantation golf course pgc for million see note to consolidated financial statements  which was included in the collateral securing the line of credit agreement 
in consideration for release of the pgc from the collateral  million of the sales proceeds were applied to partially repay outstanding borrowings and the credit limit under this facility was reduced to million 
in conjunction with the pgc sale  we amended our line of credit agreement to extend the maturity date to march and all financial covenants  except for the minimum liquidity and maximum indebtedness requirements were eliminated 
the financial covenants in our million revolving loan agreement were suspended through  except for a minimum liquidity requirement and maximum indebtedness limitation  and the maturity of this loan was accelerated to march previously june 
as a result of these amendments  million of the remaining outstanding borrowings as of march   will become due in march we are currently in discussions with both lenders to restructure our line of credit and revolving loan agreements to extend the maturity dates beyond  and to increase the amounts available under the line of credit agreement based  in part  on a re appraisal of the properties securing the line of credit and by providing additional properties as collateral under the agreement 
we also plan to sell selected real estate assets in to provide additional liquidity 
in september  lehman brothers holdings  inc  the lead lender in the syndicated construction loan for our residences at kapalua bay project filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
avoiding the stoppage of construction work on this project was a high priority to us as we worked with lehman  other lenders and the bankruptcy courts to resolve the funding shortfall 
the members of bay holdings agreed to advance funds to the joint venture  which when combined with funding received from the other lenders in the loan syndicate  were sufficient to pay the minimum progress payments due to the contractor 
construction of the project continued uninterrupted and on february   bay holdings entered into an amended and restated construction loan agreement that we believe will be sufficient to complete construction of the project 
the interim and amended financing arrangement increased costs and are expected to result in significantly reduced returns to us from the project 
the following is a summary of other material business developments in for more discussion about business developments in  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this annual report 
development projects 
while sales at the residences at kapalua bay project have continued throughout and early in  based on potential for an increase in default rates because of the current economic environment  bay holdings significantly increased the allowance for default reserves and we recorded fourth quarter equity in losses of affiliates from the joint venture of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to this investment due to the increased cost from the restructured financing arrangements and slower sell out of the project than originally forecasted note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  due to uncertainty as to when the real estate markets will rebound and our cash flow constraints  we have delayed the start of construction of new development projects and have written off deferred project costs that we do not believe can be recovered 
this resulted in a total pre tax charge of million in note to consolidated financial statements

these properties primarily consisted of land that was deemed unsuitable for precision cultivation of pineapple and were also not suitable for creating new holistic development communities 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and consolidated year ended december  change in millions  except share amounts consolidated revenues net income loss basic earnings loss per common share we reported a net loss of million for compared to net income of million for for  basic earnings loss per common share was compared to for consolidated revenues of million were million or lower in compared to the reduction in revenues was primarily due to a million decrease in the community development segment revenues  as a result of lower real estate sales in caused by  among other things  the global economic recession  declining availability of credit and worsening consumer confidence  and to a million decrease in agriculture segment revenues  primarily as a result of cessation of producing and selling solid packed pineapple products in operating losses from all of 
table of contents our business segments and  impairment charges of million in the community development segment  were primarily responsible for the net loss in in  we recognized million in revenues from the sale of real estate compared to million in revenues from real estate sales  including the land underlying the ritz carlton  kapalua hotel in general and administrative in  general and administrative expenses increased by to million compared to million for the major components of the difference in general and administrative expenses were asset write offs and severance  as follows year ended december  change in millions salaries and wages employee incentives and stock compensation professional and other outside services depreciation and asset write offs employee severance expense other net total general and administrative salaries and wages were lower in compared to due to a reduction in the number of employees across all business segments and corporate services as we reduced the size of our workforce during the second half of in response to weak economic conditions and operating losses  in particular from our agriculture segment 
increase in employee severance expense in reflects the reduction in force as well as termination payments pursuant to management changes 
the decrease in employee incentives and stock compensation was primarily due to restricted stock vesting in for certain officers and a payment in of million to david c 
cole  our former chairman  president ceo because of an amendment to mr 
cole s stock option agreement with the company that reduced the value of his stock options 
the stock option agreement was amended to eliminate adverse tax consequences to our former chairman imposed by section a of the internal revenue code 
the decrease in professional services and other services primarily reflects a reduction in use of outside consultants 
the increase in depreciation and asset write offs primarily reflects the continued restructuring of the agriculture segment that resulted in additional asset write offs in and a reduction of the estimated useful lives of certain assets  which increased depreciation charges 
the kapalua resort and other operations recorded asset write off charges in primarily for excess equipment 
other includes insurance  pensions and other benefits  charitable contributions  etc 
general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the operating segment level 
all general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to the operating segments 
such allocations are consistent with our management s evaluation of services provided to the operating segments

interest expense for includes a charge of  representing the change in the estimated fair value of the swap agreements entered into in january see note to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense for also includes a net credit of  representing the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability that was bifurcated from our million convertible notes  less interest accretion of  on the carrying value of the convertible note see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
our effective interest rate on borrowings was for compared to for the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to higher average borrowings in  being offset by lower average interest rates and the fair value credit adjustment for the convertible notes of million 
agriculture year ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the agriculture segment produced an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues for were million or lower than revenues for  primarily due to a reduction in sales of processed products 
in  continued losses reflect processing plant and logistical issues that affected the quality of our fresh product  increased costs of operations and employee severance costs as we further reduced the size of our agriculture workforce in the second half of the increased loss also reflects increased depreciation charges as we adjusted the estimated useful life of assets and asset write offs 
the operating loss for includes net charges totaling approximately million related to the restructuring of our pineapple operations 
in addition  the operating losses in and reflect the time related constraints to restructuring our pineapple operations  such as the growing period of our pineapple crop 
in   we ceased the production of substantially all solid packed pineapple products note to consolidated financial statements 
with the cessation of solid pack canned products  we began to focus our business on the sale of fresh premium pineapple 
fresh and processed operations the case volume of fresh pineapple sales decreased by approximately in compared to  and revenue per case was lower by approximately in compared to lower case sales volume and pricing in were due to delayed ripening of the fruit early in and product quality and distribution issues that prevented us from achieving optimum pricing and resulted in the disposal of a significant volume of product 
the agriculture segment cost of sales was lower by approximately in compared to  largely as a result of the lower sales volume of fresh and processed product  partially offset by increased per unit cost of sales 
per unit cost of sales increased in because all fruit growing costs are now allocated to the fresh fruit product line  because of lower production volumes and fixed costs  and due to disposal of fruit as a result of quality problems and distribution logistics 
juice is accounted 
table of contents for as a by product and the cost of the product includes the additional direct factory cost of processing fruit that is not suitable to be sold as fresh fruit product into juice 
shipping and marketing cost decreased by in compared to because of lower volume of sales and lower average per unit shipping costs 
although higher fuel charges have increased transportation costs  we were able to reduce our average shipping cost in by shipping a greater percentage of products to the mainland united states by ocean freight rather than air freight  which is more costly 
resort year ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the resort segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for resort segment revenues were million for or higher compared to revenues for largely reflecting our adventure center and mountain outpost operations that began in december and early in the increased operating loss was primarily due to increased operating costs  in particular for the new operations  a lower revenue base in our golf operations with the closure of the village course in  the cost of hosting the lpga tournament in october without a sponsor  and higher administrative costs 
in  financial results for the resort segment were sharply affected by the reduction in visitor counts due to the economic recession in the united states and elsewhere that has resulted in inability or hesitation to travel  reduced airline passenger capacity to hawaii caused by airline closures  and the high cost of energy through most of the year that affected the cost of traveling 
maui and the state of hawaii experienced approximately a and  respectively  decreases in visitor counts in compared to results for were negatively affected by the closure of the room ritz carlton  kapalua hotel in july for extensive renovations 
the hotel partially re opened in december closure of the back nine of the bay course for a comprehensive re seeding of the greens in august also had a negative impact on resort operating results 
the bay course re opened in december  but the renovation continued in and will continue in on the final greens without a course closure 
golf  retail and villas revenues from golf operations decreased by and paid rounds of golf decreased by approximately for compared to average green and cart fees increased by approximately in compared to resort retail sales for were approximately higher than sales for  reflecting increased food service sales from the honolua store after renovations were completed in may and revenues from the adventure center caf and retail operations that opened at the end of december revenues from the kapalua villas were approximately lower in compared to  reflecting an decrease in occupied rooms partially offset by a higher average room rate 
there were approximately fewer rooms available in  partially reflecting units under renovation under our kapalua gold program to upgrade and standardize the units in our rental program

in  revenues and operating profit include our sale of the land underlying the ritz carlton  kapalua hotel in march  which resulted in revenues and operating profit of approximately million note to consolidated financial statements 
our equity in the income of bay holdings was million excluding the effect of the million impairment charge discussed above for compared to million in in the fourth quarter of  bay holdings has significantly increased the allowance for default reserves and we recorded equity in losses from affiliates from this joint venture of million 
while sales of the project have continued in and early  estimated default rates were based on changes and uncertainties in the global economy 
we expect default rates to increase as a result of  among other things  the economic recession  a worsening credit market  reduced demand for real estate  and declining consumer confidence 
in  the joint venture began to recognize revenues and profits on the percentage of completion method from the whole and fractional residential condominiums 
the percentage of completion of the six residential buildings in this project ranged from to as of the end of in connection with profit recognition under the percentage of completion method  we began to recognize a proportionate amount of the unrealized appreciation of the fair value of the land and other non monetary contributions and other deferred costs related to the joint venture 
real estate sales our total real estate sales in produced million in revenues compared to million in revenues in  including the million sale of land underlying the ritz carlton  kapalua hotel

our honolua ridge phase ii subdivision consists of agricultural zoned lots  which began selling in august there were no sales in and one lot remains in inventory at the end of 
table of contents real estate development and sales are cyclical and depend on a number of factors see the risk factor entitled real estate investments are subject to numerous risks and we are negatively impacted by the downturn in the real estate market under risk factors in item a above 
results for one period are therefore not necessarily indicative of future performance trends for this segment 
comparison of years ended december  and consolidated year ended december  change in millions  except share amounts consolidated revenues net income basic earnings per common share we reported net income of million for compared to million for for  basic earnings per common share were compared to for consolidated revenues of million were or million lower in compared to the reduction in revenues was primarily due to a million decrease in agriculture segment revenues as a result of the restructuring that began in the second quarter of and to a million decrease in the resort segment revenues  largely because of the closure of the village course in february  and the temporary closure of other facilities during in  we recognized over million in pre tax profit from the sale of non core land parcels and the land underlying the ritz carlton  kapalua hotel 
we also recognized over million of income from our investment in kapalua bay holdings  llc 
losses from the agriculture and resort segments largely offset much of these gains

in  some of the agriculture segment employees were taken out of operations and retrained for other work as the operations moved toward 
table of contents a less labor intensive process and  in  we incurred employee severance charges of million as a result of the reduction in the agriculture segment work force 
the increase in professional services in primarily reflects increases in actuarial services  largely because of the restructuring of the agriculture business in in  we also incurred outside consultant costs to evaluate and manage construction issues on our kahului properties 
the increase in employee incentives and stock compensation was primarily due to restricted stock vesting in for certain officers and a payment of million to david c 
cole  our former chairman  president ceo because of an amendment to mr 
cole s stock option agreement with the company that reduced the value of the stock options 
the stock option agreement was amended to eliminate adverse tax consequences to our former chairman imposed by section a of the internal revenue code 
the reduction in depreciation expense charged to general and administrative expense is primarily due to acceleration of depreciation charges in for some of our agriculture segment assets because of changes in our business and acceleration of depreciation charges for our accounting systems that were replaced in general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the operating segment level 
all general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to our operating segments 
such allocations are made on the basis of our management s evaluation of services provided to the operating segments

our effective interest rate on borrowings was in compared to in agriculture year ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the agriculture segment produced an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues for were million or lower than  primarily due to a reduction in sales of processed products 
the principal reason for the increased operating loss is due to net charges totaling approximately million that were recorded in related to the restructuring of our pineapple operations 
in addition  the operating losses in reflect the time related constraints to restructuring our pineapple operations  such as the growing period of our pineapple crop 

table of contents effective as of june   we ceased the production of substantially all solid packed pineapple products note to consolidated financial statements

results for included million of accelerated depreciation charges related to assets where the estimated useful lives were reduced because of changes in our pineapple operations  million of employee severance cost  million of charges related to re training employees  and  of material and supply write offs 
these agriculture segment charges in were related to the move to the new fresh processing facility that went into operation in july fresh and processed operations the case volume of fresh pineapple sales was lower by for and revenue per case sold was higher by in compared to reflecting higher per unit sales revenues 
improved pricing was due to improved fruit quality in the lower case sales volume in reflects premature ripening of fruit in  which also produces lower quality fruit 
revenues from fresh pineapple sales represented approximately of the agriculture segment net sales for  compared to approximately for  reflecting the refocusing of our business on the fresh fruit market 
the case volume of processed pineapple sales was lower for as compared to primarily reflecting our plans to cease substantially all solid pack production after june  the average sales prices for our processed pineapple products decreased by approximately for compared to  primarily because we sold relatively more juice in  which has a lower sales value than canned fruit 
the agriculture segment cost of sales was lower by approximately in compared to as a result of lower sales volume of processed product 
per unit cost of sales was higher as a result of significantly lower canned product production due to the discontinuation of processing and selling solid pack pineapple 
shipping and marketing cost was approximately the same in as compared to as a result of higher per unit shipping costs being more than offset by lower sales volume 
per unit shipping costs were higher because of higher warehousing costs and higher ocean and surface transportation costs primarily reflecting higher fuel costs

in early april  the kapalua bay hotel held its final guest night and the hotel was permanently closed  resulting in approximately fewer rooms available at the kapalua resort 
in 
table of contents addition  the room ritz carlton  kapalua hotel closed in july for extensive renovations 
the hotel partially re opened in december as expected  the reduction in available rooms has negatively affected the number of paid rounds of golf and retail sales 
the closure of the village course at the end of february and closure of the back nine of the bay course for a comprehensive re seeding of the greens in august also had a negative impact on resort operating results 
the bay course re opened in december  but the renovation will continue in and on the final greens without a course closure 
golf  retail and villas revenues from golf operations and paid rounds of golf both decreased by approximately for compared to average green and cart fees increased by approximately in compared to resort retail sales for were approximately lower than in addition to the closure of facilities at kapalua resort as mentioned above  retail sales were negatively affected by lower average square footage of retail space in reflecting the closure in may of our logo shop  kids shop and home store comprising approximately  square feet in the kapalua shops following the closure of the adjacent kapalua bay hotel for the development of the residences at kapalua bay  and the closure of our  square foot kapalua collections in our honolua village center in july to make room for a resort wide welcoming  information and real estate sales center 
revenues from the kapalua villas were approximately lower in compared to  reflecting a decrease in occupied rooms partially offset by a higher average room rate 
the lower occupancy rate appears to be a trend throughout the maui travel markets and was exacerbated by the closure of the ritz carlton  kapalua hotel  which is used as an amenity by our kapalua villas guests 
there were approximately fewer rooms available in partially reflecting units under renovation under our kapalua gold program to upgrade and standardize the units in our rental program
