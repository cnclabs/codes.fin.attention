overview we are a diversified biopharmaceutical business dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of novel  mechanism targeted drugs to treat cancer and other serious disorders 
our strategy is focused on leading edge therapeutic management of cancer patients based on a portfolio of three products marketed by our align subsidiary and a clinical development pipeline 
our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology  or the processes by which cells divide and multiply 
we focus primarily on the discovery and development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing the quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
we have been focused on the cell cycle since our inception 
we market directly in the united states xclair cream for radiation dermatitis and numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges for xerostomia 
as a result of the recent revised operating plan announced on september   we are focusing our clinical development priorities on sapacitabine in acute myeloid leukemia or aml in the elderly  sapacitabine in myelodysplastic syndromes or mds  sapacitabine in cutaneous t cell lymphoma or ctcl  and sapacitabine in non small cell lung cancer or nsclc 
we may continue to fund certain additional programs pending the availability of clinical data  at which time we will determine the feasibility of pursuing advanced development including seliciclib in nasopharyngeal cancer or npc  seliciclib in non small cell lung cancer  and cyc in patients with solid tumors 

table of contents our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology  or the processes by which cells divide and multiply 
we focus primarily on the development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing the quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
we are generating several families of anticancer drugs that act on the cell cycle including nucleoside analogues  cyclin dependent kinase or cdk inhibitors and aurora kinase vascular endothelial factor receptor or ak vegfr inhibitors 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently attempting to develop nucleoside analogues  cdk inhibitor and ak inhibitor drugs  we believe that our drug candidates are differentiated in that they are orally available and interact with unique target profiles and mechanisms 
for example we believe that our sapacitabine is the only orally available nucleoside analogue presently being tested in phase trials in aml and seliciclib is the only orally available cdk inhibitor currently in phase trials 
we have worldwide rights to commercialize sapacitabine  seliciclib and cyc and our business strategy is to enter into selective partnership arrangements with these programs 
taken together  our pipeline covers all four phases of the cell cycle  which we believe will improve the chances of successfully developing and commercializing novel drugs that work on their own or in combination with approved conventional chemotherapies or with other targeted drugs to treat human cancers 
our corporate headquarters is located in berkeley heights  new jersey  with a research facility located in the united kingdom 
from our inception in through december   we have devoted substantially all our efforts and resources to our research and development activities 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit during the development stage was approximately million 
we expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical and pre clinical drug candidates 
our operating expenses comprise research and development expenses and selling and general and administrative expenses 
to date  we have not generated significant product revenue but have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements  licensing revenue  interest on investments  government grants and research and development tax credits 
prior to october  our revenue consisted of collaboration and grant revenue 
beginning in we recognized revenue from sales of commercial products  for the first time  following the align acquisition in october in accordance with our revenue recognition accounting policy  we did not recognize any revenue from sales of commercial products in we have recognized revenues from inception through december  totaling approximately million of which approximately million is derived from fees under collaborative agreements  approximately million of grant revenue from various united kingdom government grant awards and approximately million from product sales

recent events restructuring expense in september  we announced a revision of our operating plan that concentrates our resources on the advancement of our lead drug  sapacitabine  while maintaining our core competency in drug discovery and cell cycle biology 
the plan reduced the workforce across all locations by people or approximately 
we recorded approximately million for severance payments and million of accelerated depreciation for assets that will no longer be utilized 
all severance payments were paid as of december  we assigned the lease of our redundant cambridge research facility back to the landlord and  in accordance with the terms of the lease  will incur a net charge  incorporating a surrender fee  of million to effect this 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment in september  the goodwill acquired in the xcyte transaction was written down in full and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible 
table of contents assets fas 
this impairment charge was triggered primarily by a decline in our stock price that reduced our market capitalization below book value of the net assets of xcyte 
our reduced market capitalization reflected the general decline in the economic environment 
intangible assets acquired in the align transaction were also fully written down in september  in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  fas 
an impairment charge of approximately million was identified and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
this one time charge was triggered by a downward revision of projected net cash flows from product sales  required due to budgetary constraints experienced by health care providers and restrictions of the cost reimbursement program

further decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of caused us to perform an impairment analysis during december in determining the impairment charge  we considered the negative impact the current economic situation might have on sales growth expectations of the align products resulting in a downward revision of projected net cash flows from product sales 
these factors caused the discounted cash flows for the reporting unit to be less than its carrying value on december  acquisition of align pharmaceuticals  llc and align holdings  llc on october   achilles acquisition  llc renamed immediately following the acquisition to align pharmaceuticals  llc  or align  a wholly owned subsidiary of cyclacel  entered into an asset purchase agreement with align pharmaceuticals  llc and align holdings  llc or sellers  to acquire substantially all of the sellers assets

grant revenue is primarily derived from various united kingdom government grant awards 
grant revenue decreased by from approximately million in the year ended december  to approximately million in the year ended december  and by from million in to approximately  in this is as a direct result of our progressing projects past qualifying research to a later stage which does not attract grant funding  and a reduction in expenditure directed at qualifying research programs 
the future this was the first full year of align product sales  reflecting our relaunch of the three products since we acquired align 
we expect to continue to grow the business and sales of align products in as a result of our continued investment in sales force infrastructure and marketing efforts 
cost of goods sold years ended december  differences differences to to to to in thousands cost of goods sold total cost of sales represented of product revenue for the year ended december  we expect that as volumes of product sales increase  cost of sales as a percentage of product sales will reduce as the fixed element of distribution costs is allocated across an increased numbers of products sold 
research and development expenses to date  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs  with particular emphasis on orally available anticancer agents 
research and development expense represents costs incurred to discover and develop novel small molecule therapeutics  including clinical trial costs for sapacitabine  seliciclib and cyc  the advancement of product candidates toward clinical and pre clinical trials and the development of in house research to advance our biomarker program and technology platforms 
during  in response to changing market conditions  we reduced then stopped expenditure on development and preclinical activities outside of our core projects 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses primarily include clinical trial and regulatory related costs  payroll and personnel related expenses  including consultants and contract research  preclinical studies and laboratory supplies and materials  technology license costs  and rent and facility expenses for our laboratories

this has been offset by cost reductions in other programs and cost savings from the workforce reduction in september to allow us to concentrate on the advancement of sapacitabine 
the increase in strength of the us dollar against the british pound has also contributed to lower research and development expenses being recognized on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs decreased or approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  significant components of the change relate to a decrease in the charge for stock based compensation of approximately million from million during to million during as a result of the stock options granted during june being two thirds vested immediately upon grant 
this decrease was offset by an increase in costs of approximately million related to sapacitabine and seliciclib as we increased the number of phase trials in additionally  cyc expenses decreased by approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the same period in the decreases in expenses were attributable to the cyc program being in full pre clinical studies during and then moving to a phase study in the future in september  we announced a revision of our operating plan to concentrate on the advancement of our lead drug sapacitabine and to reduce our research and development costs in the other core programs to maximize the benefit of our available cash resources

the plan reduced the workforce across all locations by people 
we recorded and paid approximately million of severance costs and million of accelerated depreciation for assets that will no longer be utilized 
in addition we have accrued a charge of million in respect of costs of exiting the lease of our redundant cambridge research facility 
during the year ended december  there were no changes to the assumption and estimates underlying the restructuring liability associated with exiting the bothell facility 
as of december   the fair value of the remaining lease payments  net of estimated sub lease income was million 
fiscal as compared to fiscal in march  we assumed an accrued restructuring liability in relation to the bothell manufacturing facility  calculated as the net present value of the difference between the remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses 
in september  we entered into an exclusive subleasing agency agreement in an attempt to achieve the successful sublet of the facility 
as a result of the agreement  we recorded an increase to the restructuring provision in the third quarter of of million in recognition of commissions payable upon successful conclusion of a sublease agreement 
for the year ended december   a charge of approximately million was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the reduced likelihood of any sublet income as a result of a further deterioration in the commercial real estate market conditions in the bothell area 
the future as of december   the restructuring liability associated with exiting the bothell facility was approximately million representing the present value of the remaining lease payments  net of estimated 
table of contents sub lease income 
the restructuring liability is subject to a variety of assumptions and estimates

other income the following table summarizes the other income for years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands change in valuation of derivative change in valuation of warrants liability foreign exchange gain loss interest income interest expense total other income  net fiscal as compared to fiscal total other income  net  reduced by approximately million from million in to  in the most significant impact is the movement in foreign exchange gains and losses with a negative impact of million 
this is due to the significant increase in the strength of the united states dollar against the british pound as further detailed below 
on november   the embedded derivative associated with the dividend make whole payment expired reducing the liability to and thus no further marked to market adjustments will be made with regard to this embedded derivative 
the change in valuation of warrants relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february the warrants issued to the investors meet the requirements of and are being accounted for as a liability in accordance with eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
or eitf the value of the warrants is being marked to market each reporting period as a derivative gain or loss until exercised or expiration 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized the change in the value of warrants of approximately million and million  respectively  as other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
during the year ended december  there were unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements of approximately million on intercompany loans due to the increase in the strength of the united states dollar against the british pound 
of this  million is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations within the separate line item foreign exchange gains losses  within other income expense 
this has been offset by a realized gain of million on transactions in the year in respect of underlying operations  resulting in a net foreign exchange loss of million 
in conjunction with the operational review conducted by the company in september  the nature of intercompany funding was considered 
it was concluded that as repayment of intercompany loans is not expected in the foreseeable future  the nature of the funding advanced was of a long term investment nature and that the terms of the loans should be amended to reflect this 
effective october  intercompany loans ceased to be repayable on demand and have no fixed repayment date 
as a result of the change in repayment terms  from october  all 
table of contents unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on intercompany loans are recognized in other comprehensive income 
this has restricted the unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements recorded in other income to million  with million recognized in other comprehensive income for the three months from october  to december  future unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans will be recognized in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of stockholders equity until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
prior year foreign exchange gains of million and million for the years ended december  and respectively  have been reclassified to other income expense from selling  general and administrative expense for comparative purposes 
interest income decreased by approximately million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during  maturing short term investments were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents  being a more secure form of investment and providing greater liquidity 
as a result  these assets attracted a lower rate of interest 
this was compounded by a reduction in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments during as compared to interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for year ended december  for each of the years ended december  and  we recorded accretion expense associated with the bothell restructuring lease of million on the consolidated statement of operations as interest expense 
a further million of accretion expense will be recognized over the remaining life of the lease to december during the year ended december   interest associated with notes payable in relation to the acquisition of align on october  of approximately million was also recognized 
fiscal as compared to fiscal total other income  net  increased by approximately million to million in from million in the change in derivative value of million and million for the years ended december  and respectively is associated with the dividend make whole payment on our outstanding convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
the dividend make whole feature of the convertible exchangeable preferred stock expired on november  the change in valuation of warrants liability relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february there were no outstanding warrants requiring to be marked to market in the year ended december  the increase in interest income of approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   is primarily attributable to higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in as a result of the receipt of million in net proceeds from the registered direct financing described above 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by from the year ended december  during interest expenses resulted primarily from interest associated with a government loan  the principal of which was repaid in the fourth quarter of during interest expense resulted primarily from accretion expense associated with the bothell lease restructuring provision which amounted to approximately million 
the future the valuation of the warrant liability will continue to be re measured at the end of each reporting period 
the valuation of the warrants is dependent upon many factors  including our stock price  interest rates and the remaining term of the instrument and may fluctuate significantly  which may have a significant impact on our statement of operations 
as the nature of funding advanced through inter company loans is that of a long term investment in nature  future unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on such funding will be recognized in other comprehensive 
table of contents income until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
this will minimize the future impact of unrealized foreign exchange fluctuations on earnings 
a further accretion expense of approximately million associated with the bothell lease restructuring charge will be recognized over the remaining life of the lease through november income tax benefit credit is taken for research and development tax credits  which are claimed from the united kingdom s taxation and customs authority  in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred 
the following table summarizes research and development tax credits for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands total income tax benefit fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable decreased by or approximately million from approximately million for the year ended to approximately million for the year ended december  the level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year but restricted to payroll taxes paid by us in the united kingdom in that same year 
the decrease was a reflection of decreased income taxes available for recovery as a consequence of the lower eligible research and development payroll expenses in the united kingdom in following the workforce reductions announced in september fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable decreased or million from million in to million in the level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year but restricted to payroll taxes paid by us in that same year 
this decrease was a reflection of the higher income taxes available to recover in compared to from the payroll taxes paid in connection with the issue of group preferred d shares to certain directors and officers in march  prior to the stock purchase 
the future we expect to continue to be eligible to receive united kingdom research and development tax credits for the foreseeable future and will elect to do so  however as a result of our revised operating plan announced in september the amount of payroll taxes payable in future periods will be lower than in previous periods  restricting available income tax credits to that lower amount

the capital under the ceff may be accessed in tranches of either a of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down or b the lesser of i of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down and ii an alternative draw down amount based on the product of a the average trading volume of the day trading period preceding the draw down excluding the five highest and five lowest trading days during such period  b the volume weighted average trading price or vwap on the trading day prior to the notice of draw down  c the number of days during the draw down period and d  subject to certain conditions 
in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share which represents a premium over the average of the closing bid prices of our common stock during the trading days preceding the signing of the agreement 
the warrant became exercisable six months from the date of the agreement and remains exercisable  subject to certain exceptions  for a period of five years thereafter 
as of december  and december   the warrants issued to the investors are classified as equity in accordance with eitf operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
while we have generated modest product revenues from align product sales for the year ended december   we can not guarantee that we will generate any significant product revenues until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries and successfully commercialized 
we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next months 
however  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our operations in the longer term 
we can not be certain that any of our programs will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete the development and commercialize any of our product candidates currently in development  should they succeed 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities  the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt 
table of contents financings or strategic collaborations 
although we are not reliant on institutional credit finance and therefore not subject to debt covenant compliance requirements or potential withdrawal of credit by banks  the current economic climate has also impacted the availability of funds and activity in equity markets 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or make changes to our operating plan similar to the revision made in september in addition  we may have to partner one or more of our product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development  which would lower the economic value of those programs to us 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the judgments and estimates required by the following accounting policies to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales we have adopted the following revenue recognition policy related to the sales of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
we recognize revenue from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
as we offer a general right of return on these product sales  we must consider the guidance in fas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists fas and staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab 
under these pronouncements  we account for all product sales using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  revenue is not recognized upon shipment of product to distributors 
instead  upon the shipment of product to distributors  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the inventory held by the distributors as deferred cost of sales at the carrying value of the relevant inventory 
we recognize revenue when such inventory is sold through to the end user based upon prescriptions filled 
to estimate product sold through to end users  we rely on third party information  including information obtained from significant distributors with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers  and third party market research data 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our process for determining the appropriate level of allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment  and considers the age of the underlying receivables  type of payer  historical and projected collection experience  and current economic and business conditions that could affect the collectability of our receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy  at a minimum  on a quarterly basis 
an account is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when reasonable collection efforts have been unsuccessful and it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 

table of contents changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within general and administrative expenses 
material revisions to reserve estimates may result from adverse changes in collection experience 
stock based compensation we grant stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock to officers  employees  directors and consultants under our amended and restated equity incentive plan  which was amended and restated as of april  we also have outstanding options under various stock based compensation plans for employees and directors 
these plans are described more fully in note stock based compensation arrangements 
on january   we adopted fas r using the modified prospective application method 
fas r requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of grant date fair value for stock option awards is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the anticipated exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
such value is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line attribution method 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
warrants liability february financing eitf requires freestanding contracts that are settled in our own stock  including common stock warrants to be designated as an equity instrument  asset or liability 
under the provisions of eitf  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value until exercised or expired  with any changes in fair value recorded in the results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no subsequent fair value adjustments are required 
we review the classification of the contracts at each balance sheet date 
pursuant to eitf  since we are unable to control all the events or actions necessary to settle the warrants in registered shares the warrants have been recorded as a current liability at fair value 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
the change in fair value recognized in the financial statements during the years ended december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively  with regards registered direct offering completed in february fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for changes in the valuation of the warrants liability 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the business combination 
we recorded goodwill in march with respect to the merger with xcyte and in october with respect to the acquisition of align 
in accordance with fas  we are required to test for impairment of goodwill  and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized  on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could indicate impairment 
table of contents and require us to perform impairment tests more frequently than annually include significant adverse changes in market and economic conditions  adverse regulatory action  unanticipated competition or significant adverse change in perceived revenue potential 
we are organized as a single operating segment with two reporting units  align and xcyte  to which goodwill was assigned along with relevant identifiable assets and liabilities 
to test for impairment  we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to their respective carrying values  including assigned goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting units exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fas no 
business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation represents the implied fair value of the goodwill 
to the extent the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount we are required to recognize an impairment loss 
the fair value of our xcyte reporting unit is determined by the market value of our outstanding common stock 
however  the fair value of our align reporting unit is determined by using the income based valuation approach with respect to projected product sales 
the income based valuation measures the current value of the reporting unit by calculating the present value of its future cash flows using appropriate discount factors with regard to cost of capital experienced by entities of the same size and condition as us 
in september  the goodwill acquired in the xcyte transaction was written down in full and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in accordance with fas this impairment charge was identified through our annual impairment review process and was triggered primarily by a decline in our stock price that reduced our market capitalization below book value of the net assets of the xcyte reporting unit 
our reduced market capitalization reflected the general decline in the economic environment 
in december  goodwill allocated to our align reporting unit following the align acquisition was fully written down in accordance with fas  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million being recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
in determining the impairment charge  we considered the negative impact the current economic situation might have on sales growth expectations of the align products resulting in a downward revision of projected net cash flows from product sales 
these factors caused the discounted cash flows for the reporting unit to be less than its carrying value on december  impairment of long lived assets in accordance with fas  when indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the potentially affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value of the related asset  which is generally determined based on the present value of the expected future cash flows 
measurement of fair value is determined using the income based valuation methodology 
the income based valuation approach measures the current value of an asset or asset group by calculating the present value of the future expected cash flows to be derived from that asset  from the perspective of a market participant 
such cash flows are discounted using a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for the use of funds  the expected rate of inflation and risks associated with using the asset 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized immediately and cannot be relieved at a later date 
intangible assets acquired in the align transaction were also fully written down in september  in accordance with fas an impairment charge of approximately million was identified through our annual impairment review process and was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
this one time  non cash charge was triggered by a downwards revision of projected net cash flows from product sales  required due to budgetary constraints experienced by health care providers and restrictions of the cost reimbursement regime 
as a result the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets on september

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and investment credit ratings 
investment and interest rate risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to interest rate risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents of million are primarily invested in highly liquid money market accounts  federal agency obligations municipal bonds and commercial paper  and our short term investments consisted of million in corporate bonds with remaining maturities of one year or less 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
pursuant to our investment guidelines  all investments in commercial paper corporate bonds of financial institutions and corporations are rated a or better by both moody s and standard and poor s  no one individual security shall have a maturity of greater than months and investments in any one corporation is restricted to of the total portfolio 
to minimize our exposure to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term instruments and at december  we held no investments with a maturity in excess of one year 
due to the short term nature of our investments  portfolio diversification  and our investment policy we believe that our exposure to market interest rate fluctuations is minimal  liquidity is maintained and we do not have a material financial market risk exposure 
a hypothetical change in short term interest rates from those in effect at december  would not have a significant impact on our financial position or our expected results of operations  however we may continue to have risk exposure to our holdings in cash  money market accounts and cash equivalents  which may adversely impact the fair value of our holdings 
as of december   there were no indicators of credit risk impact to the valuation of our cash  cash equivalents or short term investments 
we do not currently hold any derivative financial instruments with interest rate risk 

table of contents foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations related to the operation of our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
at the end of each reporting period  income and expenses of the subsidiary are remeasured into us dollars using the average currency rate in effect for the period and assets and liabilities are remeasured into us dollars using either historical rates or the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period 
intercompany loans with this subsidiary are denominated in us dollars and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arising on these loans have been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations within the separate line item foreign exchange gains losses within other income expense up to september  during the year ended december  there were unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements of approximately million on intercompany loans due to the increase in the strength of the united states dollar against the british pound 
of this million is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations within the separate line item foreign exchange gains losses  within other income expense 
this has been offset by a realized gain of million on transactions in the year in respect of underlying operations  resulting in a net foreign exchange loss of million 
in conjunction with the operational review conducted by us in september  the nature of intercompany funding was considered 
it was concluded that as repayment of intercompany loans is not expected in the foreseeable future  the nature of the funding advanced was of a long term investment nature and that the terms of the loans should be amended to reflect this 
effective october   intercompany loans ceased to be repayable on demand and have no fixed repayment date 
as a result of the change in repayment terms  from october  all unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on intercompany loans is recognized in other comprehensive income 
this has restricted the unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements recorded in other income to million  with million recognized in other comprehensive income for the three months from october  to december  future unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans will be recognized in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of stockholders equity until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging 
we enter into certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies in respect of underlying operations and  therefore  we are subject to currency exchange risks 
during the year ended december   we realized gains of approximately million on such transactions 
other differences on foreign currency translation arising on consolidation of million are also recorded as a movement in other comprehensive income 
common stock price risk in february  we issued common stock and warrants 
pursuant to eitf  we recorded the fair value of the warrants as a current liability 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the change in fair value recognized in the financial statements during the years to december  and was million and million  respectively 
fair value of the derivative instruments will be affected by estimates of various factors that may affect the respective instrument  including our stock price  the risk free rate of return and expected volatility in the fair value of our stock price 
as the fair value of this derivative may fluctuate significantly from period to period  the resulting change in valuation may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in december  we entered into a ceff with kingsbridge  in which kingsbridge committed to provide us up to million of capital during the next three years 
we may access capital under the ceff in tranches  with each tranche being issued and priced over an eight day pricing period 
kingsbridge will purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the ceff at discounts ranging from to depending on the average market price of the common stock during the eight day pricing period  provided that the minimum acceptable purchase price for any shares to be issued to kingsbridge during the eight day period is determined by the higher of or of our common stock closing price the day before the commencement of each draw down 
as of december   we have not drawn down any funds under the ceff 
since june   we were unable to draw down any amounts under the ceff as the closing price of our common stock did not exceed per share
