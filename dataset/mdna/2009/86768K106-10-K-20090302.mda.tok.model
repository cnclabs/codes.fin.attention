item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other financial information appearing elsewhere herein 
overview we are a delaware corporation and a provider of senior living services in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and germany 
at december   we operated communities  including communities in the united states  communities in canada  communities in the united kingdom and nine communities in germany including two communities that were closed in january  with a total resident capacity of approximately  of the communities we operated at december   were wholly owned  were under operating leases  were consolidated as a variable interest entity  were owned in unconsolidated ventures and were owned by third parties 
in addition  at december   we provided pre opening management and professional services to communities under construction  of which communities are in the united states and seven communities are in the united kingdom  with a combined capacity for approximately  residents 
during  we opened new communities  with a combined resident capacity of approximately  residents  which were developed by us 
as a part of our operating strategy  we may provide limited debt guarantees to certain of our business ventures  guarantee that properties will be completed at budgeted costs approved by all partners in a venture  or provide an operating deficit credit facility as a part of certain management contracts 
for information regarding these various guarantees refer to liquidity and capital resources below 
the stock markets and credit markets in the united states and the rest of the world have been experiencing significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions 
as a result the market prices of many stocks  including ours  have fluctuated substantially and these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing 
continued uncertainty in the credit markets has caused us to significantly reduce the 
table of contents scope of our development business and may negatively impact our ability to refinance our bank credit facility and our maturities of long term debt due in and  at reasonable terms 
there are also current maturities of venture debt due in of approximately million 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to further adjust our business plan accordingly 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital  including through the issuance of common stock 
the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and other adverse effects on us and our business 
because of our current financial position and the significant debt maturing in and  we are seeking to preserve cash  reduce our financial obligations and reach negotiated settlements with various creditors to preserve our liquidity 
specifically  we have been seeking to reduce our payments under our guarantee obligations for development projects and our operating deficit obligations for our german communities  our fountains venture and our aston gardens venture  which have historically been the source of significant payments by us 
in conjunction with our development ventures  we have provided project completion guarantees to venture lenders and the venture itself  operating deficit guarantees to the venture lenders whereby after depletion of established reserves  we guarantee the payment of the lender s monthly principal and interest during the term of the guarantee  income support guarantees to venture partners and guarantees to the venture to fund operating shortfalls 
accordingly  we must reduce our debt and restructure and or divest these burdensome financial guarantees including operating deficit funding and completion guarantee obligations 
we are not in compliance with many of the financial covenants in our loan agreements and the loan agreements of our ventures 
we have not made principal or interest payments on the loans for our german communities in  we have not paid default interest on the loan to our fountains venture and we have not paid income support payments to the venture partner in the fountains venture 
we have commenced discussions regarding the restructuring of claims with the lenders to our german communities  the lender for the fountains portfolio  our venture partner in the fountains and certain other lenders  and we will not be in compliance with the financial covenants in our bank credit facility on march  the existence of these factors raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our auditors have modified their report with respect to the consolidated financial statements to include a going concern reference

these financial guarantees are designed to assure completion of development projects in the event of cost overruns  and  after depletion of reserves established in the loan agreements  guarantee principal and interest during the term of the guarantee 
at december   we had committed funding for communities under construction in north america and the uk not including two additional projects  both of which are wholly owned 
of these communities under construction three communities in the us are wholly owned and the rest are in development ventures 
we are not in compliance with the terms of many of these construction loans  and  as a result the lenders could cease funding the 
table of contents projects 
we are working with our lenders and venture partners to address the defaults  and we have explained to these lenders that we do not believe that there will be material cost overruns and that there are adequate established reserves to fund the lease up period once the projects are completed 
we believe  and have stated to our lenders that  in our opinion  the best course of action for all parties  including the lenders  is to continue to fund these projects through completion 
there can be no assurance that these lenders will continue to fund the construction and development of these projects 
we estimate that it will cost approximately million to complete the communities we have under construction excluding two projects that are suspended as of december  the two projects under construction that did not yet have debt financing as of december   are currently suspended and have a carrying value of million and estimated costs to complete of approximately million for a total estimated cost of million 
construction of these two projects has been suspended until we can obtain suitable construction financing 
we believe that we will have no further equity contributions for projects under construction excluding the two suspended projects as of december   assuming the lenders continue to fund existing construction loan financing commitments 
we agreed with our us development partners to suspend four construction projects scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of and we and our partners are evaluating our alternatives for these projects

also on september   we entered into an agreement with our partner that gave us permission to immediately pursue potential restructuring of loans with venture lenders  pursue potential sales of some or all of the nine communities in the venture and to merge certain subsidiaries of the venture to improve operational efficiencies and reduce vat taxes paid 
our decision to purchase this option was based on the fact that we had of the risk for the germany venture but did not have control and had only of the equity ownership

as we currently do not have any plans to develop additional communities in germany  we consider this to be an option to purchase nine communities as opposed to the acquisition of a business with intangible value and therefore  we recorded a non cash extraordinary pre tax loss of million 
after our purchase of the option  we restructured the debt for four of the nine communities 
as a result of the debt restructuring  the lender assigned a participation interest in the loan to us in the amount of million million for a purchase price of million in cash and a note that has full recourse to sunrise senior living  inc in the amount of million  resulting in a discount of million 
the remaining debt balance due to the lender after the participation is million million  which is non recourse to us  except we have guaranteed the debt to the extent that the sale price of the four germany communities securing the debt is less than a stipulated release price for each community 
the fair value of the communities approximates the million due to the lender 
for the remaining five communities  we have provided guarantees to the lenders of the repayment of the monthly interest payments and principal amortization until the maturity dates of the loans 
we have not guaranteed repayment of the remaining principal balance due upon maturity 
we closed the reinbeck community  which is one of the four properties with a minimum release price  in january we are marketing the reinbeck community for sale 
if the reinbeck community is sold for less than the minimum release price  we would be obligated to pay the difference between the minimum release price and sale price to the lender 
we have also closed our hannover community  and we are marketing this property  as well 
the loan on the hannover community is non recourse to us  but there is an operating deficit guarantee until debt maturity 
our guarantee of scheduled principal and interest payments for the hannover community through is as follows in thousands our estimated future fundings to our german operations for operating losses are as follows in thousands 
table of contents scheduled principal repayments of our germany venture debt also are included in the long term debt table in the next section 
in january  we informed the lenders to our german communities and the hoesel land  an undeveloped land parcel  that our german subsidiary was suspending payment of principal and interest on all loans for our german communities and that we would seek a comprehensive restructuring of the loans and our operating deficit guarantees 
as a result of the failure to make payments of principal and interest on the loans for our german communities  we are in default of the loan agreements 
we recently entered into standstill agreements with our lenders to eight of our nine german communities 
pursuant to such standstill agreements such lenders have agreed not to foreclose on the communities that are collateral for their loans or to commence or prosecute any action or proceeding to enforce their demand for payment by us pursuant to our operating deficit agreements until the earliest of the occurrence of certain other events relating to the loans or through march  on december  and february   we described in our current reports on form k  the standstill agreements with natixis  london branch  relating to our communities in hannover and munich  germany 
the other standstill agreements were not material to us and  therefore  were not separately disclosed by us

these amendments  among other things temporarily in february and then permanently in july reduced the maximum principal amount available under the bank credit facility to million  and 
table of contents waived compliance with the financial covenants through march  our bank credit facility contains various financial covenants and other restrictions  including provisions that require us to meet certain financial tests  require consent for changes in control  and restrict our ability and our subsidiaries abilities to borrow additional funds  dispose of all or substantially all assets  or engage in mergers or other business combinations in which we are not the surviving entity  without lender consent 
in connection with the march  amendment  we executed and delivered a security agreement to the administrative agent for the benefit of the lenders under the bank credit facility 
pursuant to the security agreement  among other things  we granted to the administrative agent  for the benefit of the lenders  a security interest in all accounts and contract rights  general intangibles and notes  notes receivable and similar instruments owned or acquired by us  as well as proceeds cash and non cash and products thereof  as security for the payment of obligations under the bank credit facility arrangements 
in the ninth and tenth amendments  the bank credit facility provided that we are generally prohibited from declaring or making any payment in the form of a stock repurchase or payment of a cash dividend or from incurring any obligation to do so  effective on the date of the ninth amendment  the borrowing rate in us dollars  was libor plus or the base rate the higher of the federal funds rate plus and prime plus through the end of the then current interest period 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the bank credit facility  the minimum rate upon which interest could accrue upon any of the loans at any time could not be less than per annum  effective on the date of the tenth amendment  the borrowing rate in us dollars  will be libor plus eurodollar rate loans and base rate as defined in the tenth amendment plus for base rate loans at december   there can be no additional borrowings and no issuances of any new letters of credit until april   and then only if we achieve compliance with the financial covenants of the loan documents  compliance with the financial covenants of the bank credit facility from december  through march  is waived  triggering of the cross default section of the bank credit facility through march  for certain events of default which might occur under other credit facilities is waived  and we make principal repayments to lenders of million and a modification fee of million 
the tenth amendment also modifies certain negative covenants to limit our ability  among other things to i pledge certain assets or grant consensual liens on such assets  ii incur additional indebtedness  and iii dispose of real estate  improvements or other material assets 
in the event that we are unable to revise and restructure our bank credit facility before march   the lenders under the amended bank credit facility could  among other things  exercise their rights to accelerate the payment of all amounts then outstanding under the amended bank credit facility  exercise remedies against the collateral securing the amended bank credit facility  require us to replace or provide cash collateral for the outstanding letters of credit 
in the event of an acceleration of our bank credit facility  we may not be able to make a full repayment of our outstanding borrowings 
as of december   we had no borrowing availability under the bank credit facility 
with our cash balance of approximately million at december  we cannot be certain of sufficient liquidity through march  and beyond to operate the business

shortly after the closing  the lender assigned the mortgage loans to fannie mae 
the borrowers must repay the mortgage loans in monthly installments of principal and variable interest 
principal payments are based on a year amortization schedule using an interest rate of 
variable monthly interest payments are in an amount equal to i one third of the discount which is the difference between the loan amount and the price at which fannie mae is able to sell its three month  rolling discount mortgage backed securities plus ii basis points times the outstanding loan amount divided by twelve 
the maturity date on which the mortgage loans must be repaid in full is june  in connection with the mortgage loans  we entered into interest rate protection agreements that provide for payments to us in the event the libor rate exceeds  pursuant to an interest rate cap purchased on may   by each borrower from smbc derivative products limited 
the libor rate approximates  but is not exactly equal to the discount rate that is used in determining the interest rate on the mortgage loans  consequently  in the event the discount rate exceeds the libor rate  payments under the interest rate cap may not afford the borrowers complete interest rate protection 
the borrowers purchased the rate cap for an initial period of three years for a cost of million including fees and have placed in escrow the amount of million to purchase additional interest rate caps to cover years four and five of the mortgage loans which amount will be returned to us in the event the mortgage loans are prepaid prior to the end of the third loan year 
each mortgage loan is secured by a senior housing facility owned by the applicable borrower which facility also secures the other mortgage loans as well  as well as the interest rate cap described above 
in addition  our management agreement with respect to each of the facilities is subordinate to the mortgage loan encumbering such facility 
in connection with the mortgage loans  we received net proceeds of approximately million after payment of lender fees  third party costs  escrows and other amounts 
other certain of our ventures have financial covenants that are based on the consolidated results of sunrise senior living  inc in all such instances  the construction loans or permanent financing provided by financial institutions is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the financed community 
the failure to comply with financial covenants in accordance with the obligations of the relevant credit facilities or ancillary documents could be an event of default under such documents  and could allow the financial institutions who have extended credit pursuant to such documents to seek the remedies provided for in such documents 
guarantees in connection with our development ventures  we have provided project completion guarantees to venture lenders and the venture itself  operating deficit guarantees to the venture lenders whereby after depletion of established reserves we guarantee the payment of the lender s monthly principal and interest during the term of the guarantee and guarantees to the venture to fund operating shortfalls

in conjunction with the formation of new ventures that do not involve the sale of real estate  the acquisition of equity interests in existing ventures  and the acquisition of management contracts  we have provided operating deficit guarantees to venture lenders and or the venture itself as described above  guarantees of debt repayment to venture lenders in the event that the venture does not perform under the debt agreements and guarantees of a set level of net operating income to venture partners 
the terms of the operating deficit guarantees and debt repayment guarantees match the term of the underlying venture debt and generally range from three to seven years 
the terms of the guarantees of a set level of net operating income range from months to seven years

see further discussion in note aston gardens in july  we received notice of default from our equity partner alleging a default under our management agreement for six communities as a result of the venture s receipt of a notice of default from a lender 
in december  the venture s debt was restructured and we entered into an agreement with our venture partner under which we agreed to resign as managing member of the venture and manager of the communities when we are released from various guarantees provided to the venture s lender 
the management fees for the years and were million and million  respectively 
at loan inception  we provided the lender a guarantee of monthly principal and interest payments and during  we made payments under this guarantee since the venture did not have enough available cash flow to cover the default interest payments 
advances under this guarantee are recoverable in the form of a loan in a capital or refinancing event prior to the repayment of capital to the partners but subordinate to the repayment of the debt 
through december   we have funded million under this guarantee 
fountains in  the fountains venture  in which we hold a interest  failed to comply with the financial covenants in the venture s loan agreement 
the lender has been charging a default rate of interest at december  since april at loan inception  we provided the lender a guarantee of monthly principal and interest payments  and in we funded payments under this guarantee as the venture did not have enough available cash flow to cover the full amount of the interest payments at the default rate 
advances under this guarantee are recoverable in the form of a loan to the venture  which must be repaid prior to the repayment of equity capital to the partners  but is subordinate to the repayment of the other venture debt 
through december   we have funded million under this operating deficit guarantee which has been fully reserved 
these advances under the operating deficit guarantee are in addition to what we have funded during under our income support guarantee to our venture partner  which also have been fully reserved 
the default was taken into consideration by the venture when testing its assets for impairment in accordance with fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and the book value of the venture s assets exceeds the fair value by approximately million 

table of contents based on that estimate  we recorded our proportionate share of the impairment  or approximately million during in january  we informed the venture s lenders and our venture partner that we were suspending payment of default interest and payments under the income support guarantee  and that we would seek a comprehensive restructuring of the loan  our operating deficit guarantees and our income support guarantee 
our failure to pay default interest on the loan is an additional default of the loan agreement  the management agreement and our agreement with our venture partner 
we have requested that the lender for the fountains portfolio agree not to foreclose on the communities that are collateral for their loans or to commence or prosecute any action or proceeding to enforce its demand for payment by us pursuant to our operating deficit agreements through march  as of february  the lender has not yet agreed to our request for a standstill agreement through march  senior living condominium project in  we sold a majority interest in one condominium venture and one related assisted living venture to third parties see further discussion in note

construction of this project was substantially complete at december  to the extent that the pace of sales of condominium units is slower than anticipated or if we are unable to realize the prices projected for the condominium units  we could be subject to additional losses 
no assurance can be given that additional pre tax charges will not be required in subsequent periods with respect to this condominium venture 
other guarantees generally  the financing obtained by our ventures is non recourse to the venture members  with the exception of the debt repayment guarantees discussed above 
however  we have entered into guarantees with the lenders with respect to acts which we believe are in our control  such as fraud  that create exceptions to the non recourse nature of debt 
if such acts were to occur  the full amount of the venture debt could become recourse to us 
the combined amount of venture debt underlying these guarantees is approximately billion at december  we have not funded under these guarantees  and do not expect to fund under such guarantees in the future 
to the extent that a third party fails to satisfy an obligation with respect to two continuing care retirement communities we manage  we would be required to repay this obligation  the majority of which is expected to be refinanced with proceeds from the issuance of entrance fees as new residents enter the communities 
at december   the remaining liability under this obligation is million

through december   we have invested million in seed capital ventures and have outstanding commitments of approximately million 
the expenditures of these seed capital entities are expensed as incurred for financial reporting purposes

cash flows our primary sources of cash from operating activities are from management fees  professional fees  from monthly fees and other billings from services provided to residents of our consolidated communities and distributions of operating earnings from unconsolidated ventures 
the primary uses of cash for our ongoing operations include the payment of community operating and ancillary expenses for our consolidated and managed communities  development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable  prepaids and other current assets  and accounts payable and accrued expenses will fluctuate based on the timing of payment to vendors 
reimbursement of these costs from our managed communities will vary as some costs are pre funded  such as payroll  while others are reimbursed after they are incurred

market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through variable rate debt

we recorded million  net  in exchange losses in million in losses related to the canadian dollar and million in losses related to the euro and british pound 
at december   we had approximately million of floating rate debt including floating rate debt that may be subject to a rate cap as discussed below at a weighted average interest rate of 
debt incurred in the future also may bear interest at floating rates 
therefore  increases in prevailing interest rates could increase our interest payment obligations  which would negatively impact earnings

a one percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million based on the amount of floating rate debt at december  a five percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million based on the amount of floating rate debt at december  critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates than we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and investments in ventures nature of estimates required goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to periodic assessments of impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter  or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill based on a purchase price allocation methodology with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
restoration of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is not allowed 
nature of estimates required intangibles and long lived assets 
intangibles and long lived asset groups are tested for recoverability when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in the projected revenues and expenses  
table of contents significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
a test for recoverability also is performed when management has committed to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset group and the plan is expected to be completed within a year 
recoverability of an asset group is evaluated by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the comparison indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized 
the impairment loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated fair value 
when an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used  the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit  intangible asset  or asset group based on market prices ie  the amount for which the reporting unit  intangible asset or asset group could be bought by or sold to a third party  when available 
when market prices are not available  we estimate the fair value using the income approach and or the market approach 
the income approach uses cash flow projections 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital  and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates  and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value of a reporting unit  intangible asset or asset group and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment of the asset 
the following key assumptions to our income approach include business projections we make assumptions regarding the levels of revenue from communities and services 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels eg  capacity utilization  labor costs  eg finally  we make assumptions about the amount of cash flows that we will receive upon a future sale of the communities using estimated cap rates 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans and budgets  growth rate a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business  and is added to budgeted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which earnings are projected to grow beyond the planning period  economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding pricing estimates for our communities and services 
these macro economic assumptions include  but are not limited to  industry projections  inflation  interest rates  price of labor  and foreign currency exchange rates  and discount rates when measuring a possible impairment  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
the market approach is one of the other primary methods used for estimating fair value of a reporting unit  asset  or asset group 
this assumption relies on the market value market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or similar line of business 
in and  we recorded an impairment charge of million and million related to our trinity goodwill and related intangible assets 
trinity ceased operations in december see note 
this impairment charge is recorded in discontinued operations 
in  we also recorded an impairment charge of million related to all the goodwill for our north american business segment which resulted from our acquisition of marriott senior living  inc in and karrington health  inc in the impairment was recorded as the fair value of the north american business was less than the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets 
the remaining goodwill at december  of million relates to our greystone subsidiary  which is not considered impaired as the entity has net liabilities due to the cumulative deferral of million of development fees and the fair value of the entity is in excess of the net liabilities 
as greystone s contracts are 
table of contents multiple element arrangements and there is not sufficient objective and reliable evidence of fair value of undelivered elements at each billing milestone  we defer revenue recognition until the completion of the development contract 
nature of estimates required investments in ventures 
we hold a minority equity interest in ventures established to develop or acquire and own senior living communities 
those ventures are generally limited liability companies or limited partnerships 
the equity interest in these ventures generally ranges from to 
our investments in ventures accounted for using the equity and cost methods of accounting are impaired when it is determined that there is other than a temporary decline in the fair value as compared to the carrying value of the venture or for equity method investments when individual long lived assets inside the venture meet the criteria specified above 
a commitment to a plan to sell some or all of the assets in a venture would cause a recoverability evaluation for the individual long lived assets in the venture and possibly the venture itself 
our evaluation of the investment in the venture would be triggered when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable due to loan defaults  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating performance and significant industry or economic trends 
assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions and approach for the evaluation of the individual long lived assets inside the venture are described above 
our approach for evaluation of an investment in a venture would be based on market prices  when available  or an estimate of the fair value using the market approach 
the assumptions and risks related are identical to the disclosure for goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets described above 
loss reserves for self insured programs nature of estimates required 
we utilize large deductible blanket insurance programs in order to contain costs for certain lines of insurance risks including workers compensation and employers liability risks  automobile liability risk  employment practices liability risk and general and professional liability risks self insured risks 
the design and purpose of a large deductible insurance program is to reduce the overall premium and claims costs by internally financing lower cost claims that are more predictable from year to year  while buying insurance only for higher cost  less predictable claims 
we have self insured a portion of the self insured risks through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  sunrise senior living insurance  inc sslii 
sslii issues policies of insurance to and receives premiums from sunrise senior living  inc that are reimbursed through expense allocation to each operated community and us 
sslii pays the costs for each claim above a deductible up to a per claim limit 
third party insurers are responsible for claim costs above this limit 
these third party insurers carry an am best rating of a vii or better 
we also offer our employees an option to participate in self insured health and dental plans 
the cost of our employee health and dental benefits  net of employee contributions  is shared by us and the communities based on the respective number of participants working directly either at our corporate headquarters or at the communities 
funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs which include estimated annual claims  third party administrative fees  network provider fees  communication costs  and other related administrative costs incurred by us 
we have aggregate protection which caps the potential liability for both individual and total claims during a plan year 
claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
assumptions and approach used for self insured risks 
we record outstanding losses and expenses for the self insured risks and for our health and dental plans based on the recommendations of an independent actuary and management s judgment 
we believe that the allowance for outstanding losses and expenses is appropriate to cover the ultimate cost of losses incurred at december   but the allowance may ultimately be settled for a greater or lesser amount 
any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
while a single value is recorded on sunrise s balance sheet  loss reserves are based on estimates of future contingent events and as such contain inherent uncertainty 
a quantification of this uncertainty would reflect a range of reasonable favorable and unfavorable scenarios 
sunrise s annual estimated cost for self insured risks is determined using management judgment including actuarial analyses at various confidence levels 
the confidence level is the likelihood that the recorded expense will exceed the ultimate incurred cost 

table of contents sensitivity analysis for self insured risks 
the recorded liability for self insured risks was approximately million at december  the expected liability is based on a confidence level 
if we had used a confidence level  the recorded liability would be approximately million higher 
if we had used a confidence level  the recorded liability would be approximately million higher 
we share any revisions to prior estimates with the communities participating in the insurance programs based on their proportionate share of any changes in estimates 
accordingly  the impact of changes in estimates on sunrise s income from operations would be much less sensitive than the difference above 
assumptions and approach used for health and dental plans 
for our self insured health and dental plans  we record a liability for outstanding claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
this liability is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims and is based on the recommendations of an independent actuary 
the variability in the liability for unpaid claims including incurred but not yet reported claims is much less significant than the self insured risks discussed above because the claims are more predictable as they generally are known within days and the high and the low end of the range of estimated cost of individual claims is much closer than the workers compensation and employers liability risks  automobile liability risk  employment practices liability risk and general and professional liability risks discussed above 
sensitivity analysis for self insured health and dental plan costs 
the liability for self insured incurred but not yet reported claims for the self insured health and dental plan is included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the liability for outstanding losses and expenses is appropriate to cover the ultimate cost of losses incurred at december   but actual claims may differ 
we record any subsequent changes in estimates in the period in which they are determined and will share with the communities participating in the insurance programs based on their proportionate share of any changes in estimates 
variable interest entities nature of estimates required 
we hold a minority equity interest in ventures established to develop or acquire and own senior living communities 
those ventures are generally limited liability companies or limited partnerships 
our equity interest in these ventures generally ranges from to 
we review all of our ventures to determine if they are variable interest entities vies 
if a venture meets the requirements and is a vie  we must then determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 
estimates are required for the computation and probability of estimated cash flows  expected losses and expected residual returns of the vie to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and therefore required to consolidate the venture 
assumptions 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we must make assumptions regarding cash flows of the entity  expected loss levels and expected residual return levels 
the probability of various cash flow possibilities is determined from business plans  budgets and entity history if available 
these cash flows are discounted at the risk free interest rate 
computations are then made based on the estimated cash flows of the expected losses and residual returns to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity and  if so  to determine the primary beneficiary 
changes in estimated cash flows and the probability factors could change the determination of the primary beneficiary and whether there is a requirement to consolidate a vie 
valuation of deferred tax assets nature of estimates required 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not defined by sfas no 
as a likelihood of more than percent such assets will not be realized 
the valuation 
table of contents of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events 
changes in our current estimates  due to unanticipated events or otherwise  could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
assumptions and approach used 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets 
if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we would be required to establish a valuation allowance 
the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified 
as such  it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses 
sfas no 
states that a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets 
this assessment  which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis  takes into account a number of types of evidence  including the following nature  frequency  and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses a pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is a source of negative evidence 
in certain circumstances  historical information may not be as relevant due to changed circumstances  sources of future taxable income future reversals of existing temporary differences are verifiable positive evidence 
projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence but such projections are more subjective and when such projections are combined with a history of recent losses it is difficult to reach verifiable conclusions and  accordingly  we give little or no weight to such projections when combined recent financial reporting losses  and tax planning strategies if necessary and available  tax planning strategies would be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards 
these strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and  depending on their nature  could be heavily weighted 
we have experienced significant losses in and as indicated above  in making our assessment of the realizability of tax assets we assess reversing temporary differences  available tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income 
we more heavily weight recent financial reporting losses and  accordingly  as of december  have given little or no weight to subjectively determined projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences 
tax planning strategies have been considered historically but due to the significant net operating loss carryforwards as of december  we have not considered such strategies to be reasonably viable 
as a result of changes in judgment on the realizability of future tax benefits  a valuation allowance was established on all deferred tax assets net of reversing deferred tax liabilities 
at december  and  our deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  were million and million  respectively 
at december  and  our deferred tax liabilities were million and million  respectively  and therefore the net deferred tax liabilities recorded were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a return to profitability by us in future periods may result in a reversal of the valuation allowance relating to certain recorded deferred tax assets 
liability for possible tax contingencies liabilities for tax contingencies are recognized based on the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
regarding the calculation and disclosure of reserves for uncertain tax positions 
fin requires us to analyze the technical merits of our tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities 
if we determine that it is unlikely that our tax positions will be sustained  a corresponding liability is created and the tax benefit of such position is reduced for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents evaluation and nature of estimates required 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step in the evaluation process is recognition 
the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step in the evaluation process is measurement 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which a the threshold is met for example  by virtue of another taxpayer s favorable court decision  b the position is effectively settled where the likelihood of the taxing authority reopening the examination of that position is remote  or c the relevant statute of limitations expires 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
interest and penalties 
fin requires us to accrue interest and penalties that  under relevant tax law  we would incur if the uncertain tax positions ultimately were not sustained 
accordingly  under fin  interest would start to accrue for financial statement purposes in the period in which it would begin accruing under relevant tax law  and the amount of interest expense to be recognized would be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with fin and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
penalties would be accrued in the first period in which the position was taken on a tax return that would give rise to the penalty 
assumptions 
in determining whether a tax benefit can be recorded  we must make assessments of a position s sustainability and the likelihood of ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
changes in our assessments would cause a change in our recorded position and changes could be significant 
as of december  and  we had recorded liabilities for possible losses on uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties of million and million  respectively 
accounting for financial guarantees when we enter into guarantees in connection with the sale of real estate  we may be prevented from initially either accounting for the transaction as a sale of an asset or recognizing in earnings the profit from the sale transaction 
for guarantees that are not entered into in conjunction with the sale of real estate  we recognize at the inception of a guarantee or the date of modification  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee which require us to make various assumptions to determine the fair value 
on a quarterly basis  we review and evaluate the estimated liability based upon operating results and the terms of the guarantee 
if it is probable that we will be required to fund additional amounts than previously estimated  a loss is recorded for that contingent loss 
fundings that are recoverable as a loan from a venture are considered in the determination of the contingent loss recorded 
loan amounts are evaluated for impairment at inception and then quarterly 
in  we recorded a loss of million for our expected loss on the operating deficit guarantees we have for our german communities and a loss of million for our expected loss on a guarantee of a specified level of net operating income to the fountains venture 
due to continued deteriorating operating performance of our communities in germany in we revised our estimated liability for operating deficit guarantees and as a result  we recorded additional expense of million 
our loss on the operating deficit guarantees for our german communities was based on projections spanning numerous years 
it is highly susceptible to future adverse change and such changes could have had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
on 
table of contents september   we began to consolidate our german communities and therefore  eliminated our liability associated with the guarantees 
assumptions and approach used 
for the german operating deficit guarantees  we calculated the estimated loss on financial guarantees based on projected operating losses and an assumed sale of the community after the operations have stabilized 
the assumed sale value uses estimated cap rates 
for the fountains guarantee of net operating income  we calculated the estimated loss based on projected cash flows during the remaining term of the guarantee 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital  and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates  and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value of an asset 
the following key assumptions to our income approach include business projections we make assumptions regarding the levels of revenue from communities and services 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels eg  capacity utilization  labor costs  eg finally  we make assumptions about the amount of cash flows that we will receive upon a future sale of the communities using estimated cap rates 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans and budgets  growth rate a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business  and is added to budgeted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which earnings is projected to grow beyond the planning period  economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding pricing estimates for our communities and services 
these macro economic assumptions include  but are not limited to  industry projections  inflation  interest rates  price of labor  and foreign currency exchange rates  and discount rates when measuring a possible loss  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
in  we recorded a loss of million for our expected loss due to the completion guarantee for our condominium project under construction 
due to continued deterioration of the condominium project in  we revised our estimated liability for the completion guarantee and as a result  we recorded additional expense of million 
accordingly  changes in our current estimates  due to unanticipated events or otherwise  could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
assumptions and approach used in calculating our loss on completion guarantees 
the computation of our expected loss on our completion guarantee involves the use of various estimating techniques to determine total estimated project costs at completion 
contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of time including the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials and the impact of delays 
these estimates are based on our best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the ultimate cost of our condominium development project 
we review our contract estimates at least quarterly to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion 
we have recorded our best estimate of our loss but it is reasonably possible that our possible loss could exceed amounts recorded 
litigation litigation is subject to uncertainties and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not fully predictable 
various legal actions  claims and proceedings are pending against us  some for specific matters describe in note to the financial statements and others arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have established loss provisions 
table of contents for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in other instances  we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of any liability because of uncertainties related to the outcome and or the amount or range of losses 
at december   we had recorded an accrual of million for our estimated exposure to loss related to the trinity oig investigation and qui tam action 
in the fourth quarter of  we revised our estimate and reduced our accrual in this matter to million 
changes in our current estimates  due to unanticipated events or otherwise  could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
new accounting standards we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  as of january  for financial instruments 
under sfas no 
 fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements  sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
these levels  in order of highest priority to lowest priority  are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities 
level observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets  but corroborated by market data 
level unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available 
sfas was applied prospectively beginning january  and therefore there was no adjustment to our financial statements as a result of adopting sfas we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on january  fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
there was no adjustment to our recorded tax liability as a result of adopting fin we adopted the fasb s emerging issues task force issue no 
 applicability of the assessment of a buyer s continuing investment under fasb statement no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  for sales of condominiums eitf on january  eitf states that in assessing the collectability of the sales price pursuant to paragraph d of fas no 
 an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyer s initial and continuing investment to conclude that the sales price is collectible in order for profit to be recognized under the percentage of completion method 
if the initial and continuing investment is not adequate  then the deposit method of accounting should be used 
we account for one investment in a condominium venture under the profit sharing method of accounting 
we do not apply the percentage of completion method of accounting for sales as deposits are fully refundable 
there was no adjustment to our financial statements as a result of adopting eift future adoption of accounting standards we will adopt sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities as of january  provisions of sfas are required to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which sfas is applied 
we are evaluating the impact that sfas will have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and goodwill acquired in business combinations to be recorded at full fair value 
transaction costs will no longer be included in the 
table of contents measurement of the business acquired and instead will be expensed as incurred 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations and earlier adoption is prohibited 
we will adopt sfas r effective january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a non controlling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation  are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
sfas is effective as of january  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas and fin  disclosures about credit derivatives and certain guarantees an amendment of fasb statement no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 and clarification of the effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp fas and fin 
fsp fas and fin provides guidance on certain disclosures about credit derivatives and certain guarantees and clarifies the effective date of sfas we do not expect fsp fas and fin  effective january   to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
impact of inflation management fees from communities operated by us for third parties and resident and ancillary fees from owned senior living communities are significant sources of our revenue 
these revenues are affected by daily resident fee rates and community occupancy rates 
the rates charged for the delivery of senior living services are highly dependent upon local market conditions and the competitive environment in which the communities operate 
in addition  employee compensation expense is the principal cost element of community operations 
employee compensation  including salary and benefit increases and the hiring of additional staff to support our growth initiatives  have previously had a negative impact on operating margins and may again do so in the foreseeable future 
substantially all of our resident agreements are for terms of one year  but are terminable by the resident at any time upon days notice  and allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the daily fees payable  and thus may enable us to seek increases in daily fees due to inflation or other factors 
any increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy of our communities 
we believe  however  that the short term nature of our resident agreements generally serves to reduce the risk to us of the adverse effect of inflation 
there can be no assurance that resident and ancillary fees will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk appears in the market risk section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
