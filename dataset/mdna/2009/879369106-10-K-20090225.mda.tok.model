item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview teleflex strives to maintain a portfolio of businesses that provide consistency of performance  improved profitability and sustainable growth 
to this end  in we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to improve margins  reduce cyclicality and focus our resources on the development of our core businesses 
we continually evaluate the composition of the portfolio of our businesses to ensure alignment with our overall objectives 
we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through our internal growth initiatives which include the development of new products  expansion of market share  moving existing products into new geographies  and through selected acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development initiatives and our ability to grow market share 
in  the company completed acquisitions in all three business segments and significant divestitures in both commercial and aerospace 
these portfolio actions resulted in a significant expansion of our medical segment operations and a significant reduction in our commercial segment operations 
the following bullet points summarize our more significant acquisitions and divestitures in  and the results for the acquired businesses are included in the respective segments 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our significant acquisitions and divestitures 
medical segment october acquired arrow international  inc  a leading global supplier of catheter based medical technology products used for vascular access and cardiac care  with annual revenues of over million  for approximately billion 
april acquired substantially all of the assets of hdj company  inc  providers of engineering and manufacturing services to medical device manufacturers with annual revenues of approximately million  for approximately million 
commercial segment december divested business units that design and manufacture automotive and industrial driver controls  motion systems and fluid handling systems the gms businesses with revenues of over million  for million in cash 
april acquired substantially all of the assets of southern wire corporation  a wholesale distributor of wire rope cables and related hardware with annual revenues of approximately million  for approximately million 
aerospace segment november acquired nordisk aviation products a s  a global leader in developing  manufacturing  and servicing containers and pallets for air cargo with annual revenues of approximately million  for approximately million 
june divested teleflex aerospace manufacturing group tamg  precision machined components business with annual revenues of approximately million  for approximately million in cash 
we incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the consideration for our october acquisition of arrow 
as of december   our outstanding indebtedness was approximately billion

global economic conditions we operated in an increasingly challenging global economic environment in recent unprecedented turbulence in the global financial and commodities markets and the downturn in the business cycle have had an adverse impact on market activities including  among other things  failure of financial institutions  falling asset values  diminished liquidity  and reduced demand for products and services  particularly in the fourth quarter of the impact of the difficult economic environment was felt mostly in the commercial segment during and we adjusted production levels and took new restructuring actions in response to the current environment 
although  on a consolidated basis  the economic conditions have not had a significant adverse impact to our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during  the continuation of the broad economic trends could adversely affect our operations in the future  as described  below 
the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed in liquidity and capital resources in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
medical our medical segment serves a diverse base of hospitals and healthcare providers in more than countries 
healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn appears to have been limited in however reimbursement changes and cost pressures created by the economic slowdown could adversely effect the financial health of some of our hospital customers in hospitals in some regions of the united states have seen a decline in admissions and a reduction in elective procedures and have limited their capital spending 
more than percent of our medical revenues come from disposable products used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted by declines in admissions 
in addition  a small percentage of our revenues could be impacted by changes in capital spending or a decline in elective procedures 
at the same time  future changes in government funding patterns or regulation could have an impact on our business 
in the united states  a number of states have enacted or proposed reduced funding for medicaid programs and higher rates of unemployment are increasing the percentage of uninsured patients who do not have the ability to pay for care 
this could create further cost pressure on hospitals and consequently on our business 
our business could also be impacted by healthcare reform legislation enacted by congress 
although the impact of the economic downturn on hospitals outside the united states has been less pronounced to date  funding to these healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments 
aerospace sudden and significant increases in fuel costs in mid resulted in reductions in capacity for passenger and cargo traffic  and accelerated retirement of older  less fuel efficient aircraft 
these trends have continued even though fuel prices have decreased from these record levels 
the sharp drop in fuel costs toward the end of has been a positive development for airlines as it has offset somewhat the recession related drop in revenues for both passenger and cargo traffic 
lower traffic overall makes it more difficult to sell cargo containment equipment due to reduced demand  but new aircraft and weight and greenhouse gas reduction objectives create some opportunities in these markets 
lower overall aircraft utilization will reduce demand for spare parts for our installed base of equipment and for our jet engine component repair services 
nevertheless  we are well positioned on certain new airbus and boeing airframes and deliveries of cargo handling systems are expected to continue at previously expected levels overall  albeit on a slightly longer time horizon from earlier forecasts 

table of contents commercial the markets served by our commercial segment are largely affected by the general state of the economy and by consumer confidence 
factors such as housing starts  home values  fuel costs  transportation  environmental and other regulatory matters all affect the market outlook for the businesses in this segment 
in  our commercial segment experienced a significant decrease in sales of recreational marine products and auxiliary power units sold into the north american truck market due to softness in these markets caused by a weak economic environment during we expect that growth will be a challenge in our commercial segment until there is improvement in consumer confidence and there is a return to global economic growth 
results of operations discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition 
activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth 
core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelve month period 
the following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations of tamg  the gms businesses  and a small medical business which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for discussion of discontinued operations 
revenues dollars in millions net revenues net revenues increased approximately to billion from billion in businesses acquired in the past twelve months accounted for all of this increase in revenues as foreign currency translation contributed to revenue growth  while revenues from core business declined compared to core revenue growth in the medical segment and aerospace was offset by a decline in core revenues in the commercial segment  which was primarily due to a significant decrease in sales of recreational marine products and auxiliary power units sold into the north american truck market due to softness in these markets caused by a weak economic environment during revenues increased in to billion from billion in  entirely due to acquisitions and foreign currency movements 
overall  there was no core revenue growth in as compared to core growth in our aerospace segment was  and our medical and commercial segments declined and  respectively year over year 
gross profit dollars in millions gross profit percentage of sales gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in this trend is driven by increases in the medical and aerospace segments as the gross profit percentage in the commercial segment was unchanged from improved margins in the medical segment were largely due to the inclusion of higher margin arrow critical care product lines for the full year in compared to only the fourth quarter in and volume related manufacturing efficiencies in the medical oem product line 
improved 
table of contents margins in the aerospace segment are principally due to a shift in sales favoring engine repair services and away from sales of lower margin replacement parts in the engine repairs business 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues improved to in from in  due primarily to cost and productivity improvements in our medical segment and the benefits of restructuring initiatives and other cost reduction efforts which offset the negative impact of a million charge related to a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition  which was sold during selling  engineering and administrative dollars in millions selling  engineering and administrative percentage of sales selling  engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in compared to in  principally due to approximately million higher amortization expense related to the arrow acquisition and approximately million higher expenses in the medical segment related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared with in  due primarily to approximately million higher amortization expense from the arrow acquisition 
goodwill impairment and in process r d charge dollars in millions goodwill impairment in process r d charge in  during our annual test for goodwill impairment we determined million of goodwill attributable to our businesses that manufacture and sell auxiliary power units in the north american heavy truck and rail markets  as well as components and systems for use of alternative fuels in industrial vehicles and passenger cars was impaired 
softness in certain of these markets at that time negatively impacted the valuation of goodwill resulting in the impairment charge 
the remaining million goodwill impairment is related to a write down to the agreed selling price of one our variable interest entities in the commercial segment 
the million write off of in process research and development costs is related to in process r d projects acquired in the arrow acquisition which we determined had no alternative future use in their current state 
interest income and expense dollars in millions interest expense average interest rate on debt during the year interest income interest expense increased significantly in compared to principally as a result of the full year impact of the debt incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition in october interest income decreased in compared to primarily due to lower amounts of invested funds combined with lower average interest rates 

table of contents interest expense increased from million to million in principally as a result of higher debt levels since october  incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition 
interest income increased in compared to primarily due to higher average cash balances during the first three quarters of taxes on income from continuing operations effective income tax rate the effective tax rate in was compared to in and in taxes on income from continuing operations of million in include discrete income tax charges incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition 
specifically  in connection with funding the acquisition of arrow  the company i repatriated approximately million of cash from foreign subsidiaries which had previously been deemed to be permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions  and ii changed its position with respect to certain additional previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these earnings as no longer permanently reinvested 
these items resulted in a discrete income tax charge in of approximately million 
the company did not incur similar charges in or restructuring and other impairment charges dollars in millions commercial restructuring program arrow integration program restructuring programs restructuring and divestiture program impairment charges total in december  we began certain restructuring initiatives that affect the commercial segment 
these initiatives involve the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at three of our facilities in europe and north america 
we determined to undertake these initiatives to improve operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources 
these costs amounted to approximately million during as of december   we estimate that the aggregate of future restructuring charges that we will incur in connection with this program are approximately million in of this amount  million relates to employee termination costs  million to facility closure costs and million to contract termination costs  primarily relating to leases 
we expect to have realized annual pre tax savings of between million in when these restructuring actions are complete 
in connection with the acquisition of arrow during  we formulated a plan related to the future integration of arrow and our other medical businesses 
the integration plan focuses on the closure of arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing  sales  marketing  and distribution functions in north america  europe and asia 
costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of arrow have been included in the allocation of the purchase price of arrow 
costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of teleflex are charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations 
these costs amounted to approximately million during as of december   we estimate that the aggregate of future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur in connection with the arrow integration plan are approximately million in and of this amount  million relates to employee termination costs  million relates to facility closure costs  million relates to contract termination costs associated with the termination of leases and certain distribution agreements and million relates to other restructuring costs 
we also have incurred restructuring related costs in the medical segment which do not qualify for 
table of contents classification as restructuring costs 
in these costs amounted to million and are reported in the medical segment s operating results in selling  engineering and administrative expenses 
we expect to have realized annual pre tax savings of between million in when these integration and restructuring actions are complete 
in june  we began certain restructuring initiatives that affected all three of our operating segments 
these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of our facilities in europe and north america 
we took these initiatives as a means to improving operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources and these activities are now complete 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced implementation of a restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for future earnings growth 
the actions included exiting or divesting non core or low performing businesses  consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services and these activities are now complete 
for additional information regarding our restructuring programs  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
impairment charges in are composed of million related to five of our minority held investments precipitated by the deteriorating economic conditions in the fourth quarter of  million impairment of an intangible asset in the commercial segment that was identified during the annual impairment testing process  and a million reduction in the carrying value of a building held for sale 
in  we determined that two minority held investments  certain intangible assets and a building held for sale were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of million

medical comparison of and medical segment net revenues grew in to  million  from  million in the acquisition of arrow accounted for of this increase in revenues 
of the remaining increase in net revenues  was due to foreign currency fluctuations and was due to core revenue growth 
medical segment core revenue growth in reflects higher sales volume for critical care and surgical products in europe and asia latin america of approximately million and million  respectively  and a million increase in sales of specialty medical devices to oems  partially offset by million lower sales volumes for critical care and surgical products in north america 
net sales by product group are comprised of the following year ended december increase decrease vs vs dollars in millions critical care surgical cardiac care oem other net revenues the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues by end market for the medical segment 
hospitals healthcare providers medical device manufacturers home health medical segment s net revenues are geographically comprised of the following north america europe  middle east and africa asia and latin america the increase in critical care product sales during compared to was almost entirely due to the acquisition of arrow in the fourth quarter of  which expanded our vascular access and regional anesthesia product lines and contributed an incremental million of sales to the critical care category in over favorable currency fluctuations added million to sales and higher sales of vascular access products in europe contributed another million in core revenue growth 
surgical product sales were essentially flat in compared to as the benefit of favorable foreign currency movements in europe million and higher volume in european and asia latin american markets million was offset by million lower volumes in north america 
this decline in north america was primarily in the chest drainage and instrumentation product lines 
cardiac care product sales increased as a result of the arrow acquisition in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents in  sales to oems increased primarily as a result of higher sales of orthopedic instrumentation  specialty sutures and other devices of approximately million and an acquisition in the orthopedic product line in early approximately million 
operating profit in the medical segment increased in to million  from million in  principally due to the addition of higher margin arrow critical care product lines 
other factors that contributed to the higher operating profit were improved cost and operational efficiencies in north america  higher volumes in europe and asia latin america  lower fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition million in versus million in and the favorable impact from the stronger euro 
the impact of these factors was partially offset by the impact of approximately million higher amortization expense related to the arrow acquisition and million in higher costs incurred in in connection with a plan to remediate fda regulatory issues 
comparison of and medical segment net revenues increased in to  million from million in  entirely due to acquisitions and currency movements 
revenues related to the acquisition of arrow international contributed million  or of this increase 
increased sales of disposable medical products for airway management  respiratory care  urology  and surgical devices to european hospital markets and to asian hospital markets  was more than offset by a decline in sales of orthopedic specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers  the phase out of some product lines for medical device manufacturers and a decline in sales of products for alternate sites in north america 
medical segment operating profit increased in to million from million in primarily due to the increase in volume from the arrow acquisition  the positive impact from the full year effect of cost and productivity improvements that began in the second half of following completion of significant restructuring activities  and currency movements  which more than offset the negative impact from a million charge in related to the fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition  which was sold in during the first half of  operating profit was negatively impacted by costs associated with operational inefficiencies and the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers 
aerospace comparison of and aerospace segment net revenues grew in to million  from million in the expansion of the cargo containers product line due to the acquisition of nordisk aviation products accounted for of this increase 
the increase in core growth is primarily attributable to increased sales of narrow body cargo loading systems and wide body and narrow body cargo spare components and repairs 
segment operating profit increased in to million  from million in the increase was principally due to the impact of the nordisk acquisition and favorable product mix of repair versus replacement in the engine repair services business as a result of technology investments we have made 
consolidation of operations and phasing out of lower margin product lines in the engine repair services business during also had a positive impact on operating profit in comparison of and aerospace segment net revenues increased in to million from million in this increase was due to increases of from core growth  from acquisitions and from foreign currency movements 
core growth was primarily attributable to increased sales of wide body cargo handling systems and narrow body cargo loading systems  combined with steady increases in sales volume for aftermarket spares and repairs throughout the year 

table of contents aerospace segment operating profit increased to million from million in as a result of higher volume  productivity improvements  and cost control efforts in both the cargo handling systems and engine repair businesses  as well as the positive impact of restructuring in engine repair services 
commercial comparison of and commercial segment net revenues declined approximately in to million  from million in core revenue declined as a result of a decline in sales of marine products for the recreational boat market and a decline in sales of auxiliary power units for the north american truck market which was partially offset by a increase in sales of alternate fuel systems and an increase in sales of rigging services products 
extreme volatility in fuel costs  accompanied by deterioration in the general state of the global economy in the second half of adversely impacted the markets served by our marine and auxiliary power unit products and we expect the marine market to remain weak for most  if not all  of as a result  we adjusted production levels and took new restructuring actions in response to the current environment 
conversely  high fuel prices in increased demand for alternate fuel systems and we successfully penetrated a large emerging compressed natural gas market in south america during the year 
in  segment operating profit increased to million compared to million in this increase was principally due to favorable product mix and an acquisition during in the rigging services business 
favorable currency impact of approximately million  cost reductions and lower warranty expenses in the power systems business offset the lower operating profit in the marine business resulting from lower sales in comparison of and commercial segment revenues increased in to million from million in the favorable impact of acquisitions and foreign currency movements and an increase in sales of products for marine markets offset a decline in core revenue attributable to a significant decline in sales of auxiliary power units in the north american heavy truck market and to lower sales of rigging services where unusually high demand as a result of us gulf coast rebuilding activities due to severe weather during caused unfavorable comparisons in commercial segment operating profit declined in to million from million in operating profit was negatively impacted by commodity price increases  lower volumes of auxiliary power units and from approximately million in provisions for warranty and other costs related to prior generation auxiliary power units sold to the north american truck market  which more than offset the positive impact of cost and productivity improvements in the business serving the marine market 
operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to in from in liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
in addition to operating cash flows  other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures  acquisitions  pension funding  dividends  common stock repurchases  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and access to other capital markets 
the deterioration in global economic conditions and the severe disruptions in global credit markets that occurred during the fourth quarter of affected the operating results of our various businesses as described above in results of operations 
in assessing the impact of these factors on our liquidity  we do not currently foresee any difficulties meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months 
to date  we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment default by our customers  and we have 
table of contents sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund additional operating needs 
however  taking into consideration current economic conditions  we recognize the increased risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity 
if current market conditions continue to deteriorate  we may experience delays in customer payments and reductions in our customers purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
recent deterioration in the securities markets has impacted the value of the assets included in our defined benefit pension plans 
as a result of losses experienced in global equity markets  our domestic pension funds experienced approximately million  or  decline in value during while this will increase pension expense in compared to  we do not expect this to cause a significant increase to our pension funding requirements for because amounts funded to the plans in prior years exceeded the minimum amounts required in those years 
the volatility in the securities markets has not significantly affected the liquidity of our pension plans or counterparty exposure 
substantially all of our domestic pension plans are invested in mutual funds registered with the sec under the investment company act of underlying holdings of the mutual funds are invested in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences  however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have and will continue to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
substantially all of our debt service requirements are united states based and we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of these requirements 
we anticipate our domestic principal and interest payments for will be approximately million and we expect to access approximately million of cash from foreign subsidiaries in to help fund these debt service requirements 
to the extent we cannot  or choose not to  repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time to meet quarterly debt service requirements our revolving credit facility is utilized as a source of liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective manner 
we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and additional sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements  capital expenditures and debt obligations 
a summary of our cash flows for the last three years is as follows year ended december  dollars in millions cash flows from continuing operations provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by used in discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities higher tax payments of approximately million net of refunds of approximately million and higher interest payments of approximately million were the principal factors in the year on year decrease in cash flows from operating activities in compared to the largest factor contributing to the higher tax payments is approximately million of taxes paid in connection with businesses divested in 
table of contents all together  changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in cash from operations of approximately million during which is principally attributable to the million of tax payments mentioned previously 
the cash flow impact from changes in other operating assets and liabilities offset one another  an inventory increase of approximately million  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  decrease in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in other operating assets of million 
the ramp up in production of cargo handling systems to meet the delivery schedules communicated earlier in the year from aircraft manufacturers and the late in the year delay of those delivery schedules into was the principal million cause of the year on year increase in inventory 
nearly all of the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is due to a year on year increase in accounts payable in the medical segment that results from changes in payment patterns to suppliers of the arrow operations during where early payment discounts were forgone in favor of longer payment terms 
the million decrease in accounts receivable reflects focused collection efforts in all segments and is in spite of higher sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of a year ago  and a heavier mix of sales in our cargo handling systems business to aircraft manufacturers in which carry longer payment terms compared to the aftermarket side of that business 
during we repatriated approximately million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities during resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
the most significant change was a decrease in inventories of million  million of which is due to the resolution  in  of operational inefficiencies experienced in the medical segment during the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers in and and focused inventory reduction initiatives in the arrow operations post acquisition  and million is the impact from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which was sold during during  we repatriated approximately million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries  exclusive of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations 
cash flow from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations in consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million  million of payments for businesses acquired that had been deferred at closing  which primarily pertained to our acquisitions of nordisk million and southern wire million  an additional investment of million in our propulsion technologies joint venture  and proceeds of million from the sale of assets and investments  principally million related to post closing adjustments in connection with the sale of the gms business  sale of investments in non consolidated affiliates of million and the sale of a held for sale building for million 
our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations during consisted primarily of payments of billion for businesses acquired  of which billion pertained to the acquisition of arrow international 
during  we received proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the commercial segment s automotive and industrial business and the aerospace segment s precision machined components business 
cash flow from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations in consisted primarily of million repayment of long term debt  million repayment of revolver borrowings  additional borrowings under the revolver of million  payment of dividends of million and payments to minority interest shareholders of million which relate to the distribution of dividends from our ati joint venture 
our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations during consisted primarily of new long term borrowings of billion in connection with the arrow acquisition  the payment of fees of million to obtain that debt  and the repayment of million of debt 
we repaid approximately 
table of contents million of debt in connection with the arrow acquisition and repaid approximately million of long term debt with the proceeds from the disposal of the automotive and industrial businesses

the spread is subject to adjustment based upon our leverage ratio 
at december  the spread over libor was basis points 
we executed an interest rate swap for million of the term loan from a floating month libor rate to a fixed rate of

also in connection with our acquisition of arrow  on october   we issued million in new senior notes the notes and amended certain terms of our outstanding notes issued on july  the notes and october  the notes  and  together with the notes  the amended notes 
in addition  we repaid million of outstanding notes issued on november  and december  collectively  the retired notes 
the retired notes consisted of the senior notes due november  and the series b senior notes due december  the notes and the amended notes  referred to collectively as the senior notes  rank pari passu in right of repayment with our obligations under the senior credit facility the primary bank obligations and are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the senior credit facility 
the senior notes have mandatory prepayment requirements upon the sale of certain assets and may be accelerated upon certain events of default  in each case  on the same basis as the senior credit facility 
the interest rates payable on the amended notes were also modified in connection with the foregoing transactions 
effective as of october  the notes bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the following rates i in respect of the series tranche a senior notes due  ii in respect of the series

the availability of loans under this facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility and senior note agreements 
moreover  additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit facility were to occur 
notwithstanding these restrictions  we believe that this revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs 
at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility for the year ended december   we would have been permitted million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december  in addition  we believe that we will continue to have adequate borrowing availability under this facility after giving effect to the scheduled reduction in the leverage ratio covenant to at september  notwithstanding the borrowing capacity described above  additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the ratios set forth in the table above are met after giving proforma effect of the ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility of the business acquired

to the extent that cash consideration is received for the sale of undivided interests in the receivables by the spe to the conduit  it is accounted for as a sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  as we have relinquished control of the receivables 
accordingly  undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the commercial paper conduit under these transactions are excluded from accounts receivables  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the interests not represented by cash consideration from the conduit are retained by the spe and remain in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the interests in receivables sold and the interest in receivables retained by the spe are carried at face value  which is due to the short term nature of our accounts receivable 
the special purpose entity has received cash consideration of million and million for the interests in the accounts receivable it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at december  and december   respectively 
no gain or loss is recorded upon sale as fee charges from the commercial paper conduit are based upon a floating yield rate and the period the undivided interests remain outstanding 
fee charges from the commercial paper conduit are accrued at the end of each month 
should we default under the accounts receivable securitization program  the commercial paper conduit is entitled to receive collections on receivables owned by the spe in satisfaction of the amount of cash consideration paid to the spe to the commercial paper conduit 
the assets of the spe are not available to satisfy the obligations of teleflex or any of its other subsidiaries

table of contents other fee charges related to the sale of receivables to the commercial paper conduit for the year ended december  were not material 
we continue servicing the receivables sold  pursuant to servicing agreements with the spe 
no servicing asset is recorded at the time of sale because we do not receive any servicing fees from third parties or other income related to the servicing of the receivables 
we do not record any servicing liability at the time of the sale as the receivables collection period is relatively short and the costs of servicing the receivables sold over the servicing period are insignificant 
servicing costs are recognized as incurred over the servicing period

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships  ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers receivables  and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer s outstanding receivable balance 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable  considering the period an account is outstanding  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  which was and of gross accounts receivable  at those respective dates 
in light of the disruptions in global credit markets that occurred in the fourth quarter of we have taken this heightened risk of customer payment default into account when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by engaging in a more robust customer by customer risk assessment 
although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results  management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience 
however  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur  additional allowances may be required 
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value 
table of contents include i current sales data and historical return rates  ii estimates of future demand  iii competitive pricing pressures  iv new product introductions  v product expiration dates  and vi component and packaging obsolescence 
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was million at december  and million at december  which was and of gross inventories  at those respective dates 
accounting for long lived assets and investments the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets by reporting segment at december  are as follows medical aerospace commercial total dollars in thousands goodwill intangible assets indefinite lived finite lived goodwill and intangible assets acquired intangible assets may represent indefinite lived assets eg  certain trademarks or brands  determinable lived intangibles eg  certain trademarks or brands  customer relationships  patents and technologies or residual goodwill 
of these  only the costs of determinable lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 
the value of the indefinite lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets  primarily trademarks and brand names  are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter  using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date  or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value 
assumptions used in the company s impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 
goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level 
for purposes of this assessment  the company s reporting units are generally its businesses one level below the respective operating segment 

table of contents goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
in performing the first step  the company calculated fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods  one which estimates the discounted cash flows dcf of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the market approach 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  perpetual growth rates  operating margins  industry trends  regulatory environment  relevant comparable company selection  calculation of comparable company multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit where the compound annual growth rates during this period for the medical  aerospace and commercial segments range from approximately to for revenue and from approximately to for operating income 
discount rates range from to  and a perpetual growth rate of was assumed for all reporting units 
the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on internal budgets and business plans and various long term growth assumptions beyond the business plan period 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs 
in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit  we considered the results of both the dcf and the market comparable methods and concluded the fair value to be the average of the results yielded by the two methods for each reporting unit 
then  the current market capitalization of the company was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units  plus a control premium  to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization 
the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately  which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 
no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above 
in light of market conditions in the fourth quarter we considered whether there were any triggering events which would have caused us to re assess our goodwill impairment considerations as of the assessment date and we determined that there were no triggering events 
to illustrate the magnitude of potential impairment charges relative to future changes in projected operating income and discount rates  the following table shows the sensitivity to and percentage point increases in the discount rate or a and reduction in the compound annual growth rate of operating income decrease in fair value of reporting units operating income discount rate medical aerospace commercial none of these scenarios resulted in an indication of impairment in any of our reporting units 
while we are not aware of any known trends  uncertainties or other factors that will result in  or that are reasonably likely to result in  a material impairment charge in the future  events could occur in the future which are currently unforeseen that could result in an impairment 

table of contents intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill 
intangible assets acquired are comprised mainly of technology  customer relationships  and trade names 
the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method  which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow 
the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method 
the excess earnings method measures economic benefit indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to an asset after appropriate returns are paid to complementary or contributory assets 
the residual profit is tax effected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
management tests indefinite lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis  or more frequently if necessary 
in connection with the analysis  management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to its estimated fair value 
since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets  we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value 
common among such approaches is the relief from royalty methodology 
this methodology estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate  discount rate  and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 
discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of indefinite lived assets during the fourth quarter of are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill by segment 
compound annual growth rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the medical segment ranged from to and a royalty rate of was assumed 
the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the commercial segment was and a royalty rate of was assumed 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets 
assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 
this analysis indicated that certain trade names in the commercial segment were impaired by million and this was charged to restructuring and other impairment charges during the fourth quarter of had the fair value of each company s indefinite lived assets been hypothetically lower than presently estimated by as of september   certain trade names in the commercial segment would have been impaired by an additional million and the arrow trade name would have been impaired million 
long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets eg  customer relationships  do not require that an annual impairment test be performed  instead  long lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
triggering events include the likely ie  more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and re assessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finite lived assets by  among other things  validating customer attrition rates 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of arrow international  the company recorded a million charge to operations during  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  for in process research and development ipr d assets acquired that the 
table of contents company determined had no alternative future use in their current state 
the company continues to evaluate certain of these projects for their feasibility and alignment with the company s core strategic objectives 
as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation for arrow  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to acquire in process research and development projects 
the amount allocated to the acquired in process research and development represents the estimated value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to in process projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the date of the acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  the company may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects 
the value assigned to the acquired in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the acquired in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
the rate of percent utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the company s acquisition model plus a risk premium 
due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the developmental projects  appropriate risk adjusted discount rates were used for the in process research and development projects 
the discount rates are based on the stage of completion and uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology projects 
the purchased in process technology of arrow relates to research and development projects in the following product families central venus access catheters cvc and specialty care catheters specialty care 
the most significant purchased set of in process technologies relates to the cvc product family for which the company estimated a value of million 
the projects included in this product family s in process technology include the hi c project  picc triple lumen  antimicrobial picc  and certain catheter tip positioning technology 
the remaining purchased set of in process technologies relates to the specialty care product family for which the company has estimated a value of million 
the projects included in this product family s in process technology include the ethanol lock program and antimicrobial chdc 
the successful development of new products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  both known and unknown  including unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  technical problems and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products and enhancements  including  for example  changes requested by the fda in connection with pre market approval applications for products or k notification 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  there can be no assurance that any of the company s product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
the failure of the company to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm the company s results of operations and financial condition 
for additional risks that may affect the company s business and prospects following completion of the merger  see risk factors commencing on page of this annual report on form k 

table of contents accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates 
we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows pension other benefits discount rate rate of return initial healthcare trend rate ultimate healthcare trend rate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the following table shows the sensitivity to changes in the weighted average assumptions expected return assumed discount rate on plan assets basis basis basis assumed healthcare trend rate point point point increase decrease change increase decrease dollars in millions net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense projected benefit obligation product warranty liability most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of the sales 
we estimate our warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors including historical trends of units sold  the status of existing claims  recall programs and communication with customers 
our estimated product warranty liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties  make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates 
we conduct a broad range of operations around the world  subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions  resulting at times in tax audits  disputes and potentially litigation  the outcome of which is uncertain 
management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates  which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled 
the likelihood of a material change in the company s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding 
table of contents income taxes are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities and such adjustments could be material 
we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events  including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
based on this assessment  we evaluate the need for  and amount of  valuation allowances to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and december   respectively  relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance decrease in was principally attributable to i the deconsolidation of a subsidiary  ii the increased ability to utilize certain state net operating losses as a result of the mergers of several subsidiaries  and iii the increased ability to utilize certain state net operating losses as a result of a shift in state apportionment factors following the gms transaction

we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known
