item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist you in understanding our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements 
our discussion contains both historical and forward looking information 
we assess the risks and uncertainties about our business  long term strategy and financial condition before we make any forward looking statements but we cannot guarantee that our assessment is accurate or that our goals and projections can or will be met 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition expenditures as well as expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
we make assumptions about commodity prices  drilling results  production costs  administrative expenses and interest costs that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information 
critical estimates and accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in this report using accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements 
we must make judgments  estimates  and in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives as we apply these rules and requirements 
the most critical estimate we make is the engineering estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
this estimate affects the application of the successful efforts method of accounting  the calculation of depreciation  depletion  and amortization of oil and 
table of contents gas properties and the estimate of the impairment of our oil and gas properties 
it also affects the estimated lives used to determine asset retirement obligations 
in addition  the estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are the basis for the related standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
estimated proved oil and gas reserves the evaluation of our oil and gas reserves is critical to management of our operations and ultimately our economic success 
decisions such as whether development of a property should proceed and what technical methods are available for development are based on an evaluation of reserves 
these oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis of calculating the unit of production rates for depreciation  evaluating impairment and estimating the life of our producing oil and gas properties in our asset retirement obligations 
our proved reserves are classified as either proved developed or proved undeveloped 
proved developed reserves are those reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves include reserves expected to be recovered from new wells from undrilled proven reservoirs or from existing wells where a significant major expenditure is required for completion and production 
independent reserve engineers prepare the estimates of our oil and gas reserves presented in this report based on guidelines promulgated under gaap and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the evaluation of our reserves by the independent reserve engineers involves their rigorous examination of our technical evaluation and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines as well as other technical information and measurements 
reservoir engineers interpret these data to determine the nature of the reservoir and ultimately the quantity of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to a specific property 
our proved reserves in this report include only quantities that we expect to recover commercially using current prices  costs  existing regulatory practices and technology 
while we are reasonably certain that the proved reserves will be produced  the timing and ultimate recovery can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and changes in projections of long term oil and gas prices 
revisions can include upward or downward changes in the previously estimated volumes or proved reserves for existing fields due to evaluation of already available geologic  reservoir or production data or new geologic or reservoir data obtained from wells 
revisions can also include changes associated with significant changes in development strategy  oil and gas prices or production equipment facility capacity 
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relies on these estimates of oil and gas reserves using commodity prices and costs at year end 
in our year end reserve report  we used december  conocophillips west texas intermediate posted price of per bbl and a henry hub onshore price of per mmbtu adjusted by property for energy content  quality  transportation fees and regional price differentials 
the weighted average price over the lives of the properties was per bbl for oil and per mcf for gas 
while we believe that future operating costs can be reasonably estimated  future prices are difficult to estimate since the market prices are influenced by events beyond our control 
future global economic and political events will most likely result in significant fluctuations in future oil prices 
successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies choose one of two acceptable accounting methods  successful efforts or full cost 
the most significant difference between the two methods relates to the accounting treatment of drilling costs for unsuccessful exploration wells dry holes and exploration costs 
under the successful efforts method  exploration costs and dry hole costs the primary uncertainty affecting this method are recognized as expenses when incurred and the costs of successful exploration wells are capitalized as oil and gas properties 
entities that follow the full cost method capitalize all drilling and exploration costs including dry hole costs into one pool of total oil and gas property costs 

table of contents while it is typical for companies that drill exploration wells to incur dry hole costs  our primary activities during focused on development wells and our exploratory drilling activities were immaterial 
nevertheless  we will selectively expand our exploration drilling in the future 
it is impossible to accurately predict specific dry holes 
because we can not predict the timing and magnitude of dry holes  quarterly and annual net income can vary dramatically 
the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of capitalized costs under the successful efforts method of accounting differs from the full cost method in that the successful efforts method requires us to calculate depreciation  depletion and amortization expense on individual properties rather than one pool of costs 
in addition  under the successful efforts method we assess our properties individually for impairment compared to one pool of costs under the full cost method 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties the unit of production method of depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting is applied pursuant to the simple multiplication of units produced by the costs per unit on a field by field basis 
leasehold cost per unit is calculated by dividing the total cost by the estimated total proved oil and gas reserves associated with that field 
well cost per unit is calculated by dividing the total cost by the estimated total proved producing oil and gas reserves associated with that field 
the volumes or units produced and asset costs are known and while the proved reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
the factors which create this variability are included in the discussion of estimated proved oil and gas reserves above 
impairment of oil and gas properties we test for impairment of our properties based on estimates of proved reserves 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of the carrying amounts 
initially this analysis is based on proved reserves 
however  when we believe that a property contains oil and gas reserves that do not meet the defined parameters of proved reserves  an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation 
these reserves are subject to much greater risk of ultimate recovery 
an asset would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value 
impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
impairment analysis is performed on an ongoing basis 
in addition to using estimates of oil and gas reserve volumes in conducting impairment analysis  it is also necessary to estimate future oil and gas prices 
the impairment evaluation triggers include a significant long term decrease in current and projected prices  or reserve volumes  an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected and historical and current negative operating losses 
although we evaluate future oil and gas prices as part of the impairment analysis  we do not view short term decreases in prices  even if significant  as impairment triggering events 
exploratory drilling costs the costs of drilling an exploratory well are capitalized as uncompleted wells pending the determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if proved reserves are not found  these capitalized costs are charged to expense 
on the other hand  the determination that proved reserves have been found results in continued capitalization of the well and its reclassification as a well containing proved reserves 
asset retirement obligation the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of 
table of contents tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
the fair value of asset retirement obligation liabilities has been calculated using an expected present value technique 
fair value  to the extent possible  should include a market risk premium for unforeseeable circumstances 
a five percent market risk premium was included in the company s asset retirement obligation fair value estimate 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is amortized over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
this standard requires the company to record a liability for the fair value of the dismantlement and plugging and abandonment costs  excluding salvage values 
derivatives derivative financial instruments  utilized to manage or reduce commodity price risk related to dune s production  are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  and related interpretations and amendments 
under this statement  derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings 
if the derivative is not designated as a hedge  changes in the fair value are recognized in other expense 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are also recognized in loss on derivative liabilities 
effective january   the company discontinued  prospectively  the designation of its derivatives as cash flow hedges 
the net derivative loss related to the discontinued cash flow hedges  as of december   will continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss until such time that they are charged to income or loss as the volumes underlying the cash flow hedges are realized 
beginning january   the gain or loss on derivatives is being recognized currently in earnings 
stock based compensation on january   dune adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r replaced sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
dune adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report have additional discussion of our significant accounting policies 
business strategy dune is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and exploitation of natural gas and crude oil properties  with interest along the gulf coast 
on may   we closed the stock purchase and sale agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of goldking from goldking energy holdings  lp goldking was an independent energy company focused on the exploration  exploitation and development of natural gas and crude properties located onshore and in state waters along the gulf coast  the acquisition of goldking substantially increased our proved reserves  provided significant drilling upside and increased our geographic and geological well diversification 
additionally  the acquisition of goldking provided us with exploration opportunities within our core geographic area 
our properties now cover over  gross acres across oil and natural gas fields onshore and in state waters along the texas and louisiana gulf coast 

table of contents grow through exploitation  development  and exploration of our properties 
our primary focus will continue to be the development and exploration efforts in our gulf coast properties 
we believe that our properties and acreage position will allow us to grow organically through low risk drilling in the near term  as this property set continues to present attractive opportunities to expand our reserve base through workovers and recompletions  field extensions  delineating deeper formations within existing fields and higher risk higher reward exploratory drilling 
in addition  we will constantly review  rationalize and high grade our properties in order to optimize our existing asset base 
consistent with this goal  during the second half of  we closed the previously announced sale of our barnett shale assets  located in denton and wise counties  texas 
maintain and utilize state of the art technological expertise 
we expect to maintain and utilize our technical and operations teams knowledge of salt dome structures and multiple stacked producing zones common in the gulf coast to enhance our growth prospects and reserve potential 
we will employ technical advancements  including d seismic data  pre stack depth migration and directional drilling to identify and exploit new opportunities in our asset base 
we also plan to employ the latest drilling  completion and fracturing technology in all of our wells to enhance recoverability and accelerate cash flows associated with these wells 
pursue opportunistic acquisitions of underdeveloped properties 
we review opportunities to acquire producing properties  leasehold acreage and drilling prospects 
we are seeking to acquire operational control of properties that we believe have a solid proved reserves base coupled with significant exploitation and exploration potential 
we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and make acquisitions that we believe will further enhance our operations and reserves in a cost effective manner 
actively manage the risks and rewards of our drilling program 
our strategy is to increase our oil and gas reserves and production while keeping our finding and development costs and operating costs on a per mcf equivalent mcfe basis competitive with our industry peers 
we will implement this strategy through drilling exploratory and development wells from our inventory of available prospects that we have evaluated for geologic and mechanical risk and future reserve potential 
our drilling program will contain some higher risk higher reserve potential opportunities as well as some lower risk lower reserve potential opportunities in order to achieve a balanced program of reserve and production growth 
success of this strategy is contingent on various risk factors  as discussed elsewhere in the k 
in we invested million in oil and gas properties 
continuing operations accounted for million of this total and million was associated with the barnett shale properties sold during the second half of the year 
the investment in continuing operations added bcfe through extensions and discoveries 
we produced bcfe during the year including bcfe from discontinued operations in the barnett shale 
revisions of previous estimates were bcfe negative  mainly reflecting unsuccessful completion operations in the cobb well in the comite field 
the company sold its interest in the barnett shale assets which accounted for a bcfe year over year reduction in proved reserves 
as of december   dune s barnett shale proved reserves totaled bcfe 
bcfe was extracted and sold from the discontinued barnett shale properties during prior to the closing date of the sale 

table of contents capital costs year ended year ended year ended three years ended acquisitions proved acquisitions unproved exploration development total capex before aro aro costs total capex including aro barnett shale capex total capex including aro and excluding barnett shale asset retirement obligation non cash proved reserves mmcfe beginning production purchases barnett shale sale discoveries extensions revisions ending reserves reserve additions before revisions mmcfe reserve additions after revisions mmcfe the implementation of our strategy requires that we continually incur significant capital expenditures in order to replace current production and find and develop new oil and gas reserves 
in order to finance our capital and exploration program  we depend on cash flow from operations or bank debt and equity offerings as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
hurricanes as previously announced  during the third quarter we experienced two production disruptions by hurricanes gustav and ike resulting in production shut ins 
many of our onshore louisiana fields were flooded and incurred minor structural damage 
such damage did not exceed dune s deductibles for insurance claims 
production has been restored at all fields 
in total  dune estimates that production deferrals associated with the two hurricanes were approximately bcfe 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal compared to fiscal  net cash flow provided by all operating activities decreased by million to million 
this decline was primarily attributable to our efforts to substantially reduce our accounts payable which had accumulated in as a result of our aggressive capital program 
our current assets stood at million on december  cash on hand at year end was million  which compared to million at the end of calendar year the barnett shale disposition  as mentioned earlier  facilitated the reduction in our accounts payable from million at year end to million at december  the financial statements continue to reflect our active and ongoing drilling and facilities upgrade program which involved almost million of capital investment in the fourth quarter of and another 
table of contents million during expenditures in the discontinued barnett shale operations accounted for million of the total 
the hurricanes caused only minor damage to certain of our production operations and no material cash outlays were necessary to restore this capacity 
during  the availability under our revolving line of credit was increased to million 
as of december  and  there were no borrowings under our credit facility 
this compared with million outstanding at the end of the second quarter of proceeds from the barnett shale asset sale  after customary purchase price adjustments  were utilized to eliminate borrowings outstanding under the revolver  and for general working capital 
semi annual interest of million on our senior secured notes due was paid on december  and will be due semi annually thereafter 
the principal on the senior secured notes is not due until shares of our senior redeemable convertible preferred stock are not redeemable until december  or upon a change in control 
dividends are payable quarterly beginning september  with the company having the option of paying any dividend on the preferred stock in shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock or cash 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities  debt financing  sales of non core properties and access to capital markets 
the strength of our current cash position and availability under our revolver put us in a favorable position to meet our financial obligations and ongoing capital programs even as commodity prices continue to decline from their mid year record highs 
for  capital spending will be targeted at between million and million 
the exact amount will depend upon individual well performance results  cash flow and  where applicable  partner negotiations on the timing of drilling operations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations debt and interest office lease total changes in our working capital accounts from to include a million decrease in our accounts receivable due to lower oil and gas prices  decreased production and decreased balances due from our joint interest participants 
for essentially the same reasons  our accounts payable balance declined by million 
on december   our current assets were less than our current liabilities by million 
we believe our short term and long term liquidity augmented by sale of non core properties  if needed  is adequate to fund operations  including capital expenditures  interest and repayment of debt maturities 
results of operations comparison of and year over year production volumes were up significantly as a result of the goldking acquisition and increased operating and drilling activities  rising from  mmcfe for the twelve months of fiscal to 
table of contents  mmcfe for the same period of nevertheless  this increase was tempered partially by the adverse impact on production of hurricanes gustav and ike during the third quarter of and the completion of the sale of the barnett shale properties during the second half of the year 
the following table discloses the net oil and gas production volumes  sales  and sales prices for each of the two years ended december  and increase decrease oil production volume mbbls oil sales revenue price per bbl increase in oil sales revenue due to change in prices change in production volume total increase decrease in oil sales revenue gas production volume mmcf gas sales revenue price per mcf increase in gas sales revenue due to change in prices change in production volume total increase decrease in gas sales revenue revenues revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased million from the prior twelve month period ended december  to million 
this was the result of higher commodity prices  which averaged mcfe for the year versus in however  production gains were tempered by the third quarter shut ins caused by hurricanes gustav and ike and the completion of the barnett shale sale at the end of the third quarter of operating expenses lease operating expense and production taxes total lease operating expense for increased million from the comparable period to million 
this translated to a decrease of mcfe to mcfe on a volume basis 
the full year s effect of the goldking acquisition and the concomitant increase in the number of operating properties made up the vast amount of this increase as direct operating expense rose million to million mcfe 
production taxes accounted for the second largest cost of operations  increasing million to million mcfe 
a decline of million in workover expense to million partially offset these increases 

table of contents the following table presents the major components of our operating costs for the last three years on a per mcfe basis years ending december  total per mcfe total per mcfe total per mcfe direct operating expense workovers ad valorem taxes production taxes transportation exploration expenses exploration costs for the year ended totaled million compared to million in this reduction of million is the result of the company s continuing focus on drilling development wells in order to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 
accretion of asset retirement obligation accretion expense for the year increased from million in to million in representing a million increase 
the modest increase is the result of the impact of reevaluating abandonment costs at year end depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a for  the company recorded dd a expense of million mcfe compared to million mcfe for representing an increase of million 
the increase in dd a year over year is primarily attributable to a full year s depletion of oil and gas properties purchased in the goldking acquisition in versus months in and a downward revision in reserves on certain fields 
general and administrative expense g a expense g a expense for declined by million mcfe from the comparable period to million mcfe 
the decrease was the result of a million decline in stock based compensation to million as well as a reduction in cash g a expenses of million to million mcfe 
part of this decline is attributable to the million of non recurring one time severance payments to former goldking employees whose employment was terminated by dune following the acquisition 
furthermore  g a also reflected a reduction in total employees from to loss on impairment of oil and gas properties the company recorded million or pre tax  non cash impairment charges associated with its oil and natural gas properties in the fourth quarter of this impairment primarily resulted from lower oil and natural gas prices 
the company s bank covenants are not impacted by this non cash charge 
other income expense interest income interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the comparable period 
this was the result of using our cash balances in to support working capital and contribute to the capital program 

table of contents interest expense interest expense on debt borrowing for amounted to million compared to million in the increase of million is attributable in part to outstanding borrowings under the revolver commitment which reached a mid year peak of million and was paid off in august  the balance of the rise was the full year s impact of the interest on million in senior secured notes issued at the end of the second quarter of loss on derivative liabilities effective january   the company discontinued  prospectively  the designation of its derivatives as cash flow hedges 
the net derivative loss related to the discontinued cash flow hedges  as of december   will continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss until such time that they are charged to income or loss as the volumes underlying the cash flow hedges are realized 
beginning january   the loss on derivatives is being recognized currently in earnings 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a gain on derivatives of million  composed of an unrealized gain of million due to the change in the mark to market valuation partially offset by a realized loss of million for cash settlements 
the comparable period ended december  yielded a loss on derivatives of million 
income tax benefit the company s taxes were subject to a full valuation allowance yielding tax benefit 
as a result of the goldking acquisition in the second quarter of  the company has significant deferred tax liabilities in excess of its deferred tax assets 
management has determined that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary as the realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
consequently  in the company has recorded an income tax benefit of million for continuing operations and million for discontinued operations 
discontinued operations associated with the sale of the barnett shale properties  the company has reflected all activity for these assets as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   the company reclassified million as income from discontinued operations 
an income tax expense of million yielded net income for the year of million 
for the year ended december   the company generated a net gain from the operation of the barnett shale properties of million 
this gain was added to a million impairment to write down the related carrying amounts to their fair value less cost to sell 
an income tax benefit of million was added to this transaction yielding a million loss on discontinued operations for net loss net loss from continuing operations for reached million  up from the comparable net loss from continuing operations of million 
total net loss from continuing and discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million versus million for comparison of and a comparison of balances between to focuses on activity of the company with months of activity related to the goldking acquisition in compared to a full year of activity without the goldking acquisition in after reclassifying all of the activity related to the barnett shale assets as discontinued operations  the operating loss reflected a slight decrease of million 
other income expense reflected an increase of million which was primarily attributable to the interest expense on the senior secured notes issued in 
table of contents a comparison of discontinued operations related to the barnett shale assets resulted in a million increase from to this change is specifically attributable to the impairment of the barnett shale properties of million in in  as a result of the goldking acquisition  dune recognized a deferred tax benefit of million which was allocated between continued and discontinued operations 
prior to  the net deferred tax asset had a valuation reserve and was not recognized in income 
associated with the issuance of preferred stock in  dune recorded preferred stock dividends of million 
no preferred stock dividends were recorded in the net impact of these various components was a decrease in the net loss available to shareholders from million to million 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the securities and exchange commission sec issued the final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting final rule 
the final rule adopts revisions to the sec s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on forms k for years ending on or after december  the revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies 
the amendments are also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and technological advances 
revised requirements in the final rule include  but are not limited to oil and gas reserves must be reported using a month average of the closing prices on the first day of each of such months  rather than a single day year end price companies will be allowed to report  on a voluntary basis  probable and possible reserves  previously prohibited by sec rules  and easing the standard for the inclusion of proved undeveloped reserves puds and requiring disclosure of information indicating any progress toward the development of puds 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting the final rule 
the sec is discussing the final rule with the fasb and iasb staffs to align accounting standards with the final rule 
these discussions may delay the required compliance date 
absent any change in such date  we will begin complying with the disclosure requirements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  voluntary early compliance is not permitted 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue  determining whether and instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock issue 
under issue  an instrument or embedded feature would not be considered indexed to an entity s own stock if its settlement amount is affected by variables other than those used to determine the fair value of a plain vanilla option or forward contract on equity shares  or if the instrument contains a feature such as a leverage factor that increases exposure to those variables 
an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature would not be considered indexed to the entity s own stock if the strike price is denominated in a currency other than the issuer s functional currency 
this issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is not permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that eitf will have on its consolidated financial position or result of operations 
in june  fasb issued eitf issue no 
 transition guidance for conforming changes to issue no 
eitf no 

the objective of eitf no 
is to provide transition guidance for conforming 
table of contents changes made to eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  that result from eitf no 
application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this issue is effective for financials statements issued for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective beginning january  and required entities to provide expanded disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities including the ways in which an entity uses derivatives  the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  and the impact that derivatives have or could have on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas requires expanded disclosures and does not change the accounting for derivatives 
dune is currently evaluating the impact of sfas  but we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is the commodity pricing available to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
to mitigate some of this risk  we engage periodically in certain hedging activities  including price swaps  costless collars and  occasionally  put options  in order to establish some price floor protection see note to financial statements 
we also have some exposure to market risk consisting of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreement with our senior lender 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations 
we manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable debt
