critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most critical estimates relate to revenue recognition  the collectibility of accounts receivable and related reserves  obligations under insurance programs  which include workers compensation  professional liability  property and general liability and employee health and welfare insurance programs  and prior to the carecentrix transaction  the cost of claims incurred but not reported 
a description of the critical accounting policies and a discussion of the significant estimates and judgments associated with such policies are described below 
revenue recognition revenues recognized by the company are subject to a number of elements which impact both the overall amount of revenue realized as well as the timing of the collection of the related accounts receivable 
in each category described below  the impact of the estimate  if applicable  undertaken by the company with respect to these elements is reflected in net revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
see further discussion of the elements below under the heading causes and impact of change on revenue 
in addition  these elements can be impacted by the risk factors described in risks related to gentiva s business and industry and risks related to healthcare regulation  which appear in part i  item a of this report 
fee for service agreements under fee for service agreements with patients and commercial and certain government payers  net revenues are recorded based on net realizable amounts to be received in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered 
fee for service contracts with commercial payers are traditionally one year in term and renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated by either party 

table of contents capitated arrangements the company has capitated arrangements with certain managed care customers 
under the capitated arrangements  net revenues are recognized based on a predetermined monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the volume of services covered by the capitation arrangements 
net revenues generated under capitated arrangements were approximately percent  percent  and percent of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  the majority of such revenues were generated from the company s carecentrix business 
prospective payment system reimbursements under pps reimbursement  the company estimates net revenues to be recorded based on a reimbursement rate which is determined using relevant data  such as the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and certain other factors  as well as applicable wage indices to give effect to geographic differences in wage levels 
billings under pps are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over an average patient treatment period 
the process for recognizing revenue to be recorded is based on certain assumptions and judgments  including the average length of time of each treatment as compared to a standard day episode  the appropriateness of the clinical assessment of each patient at the time of certification and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits  have significant changes in condition or are subject to certain other factors during the episode 
revenue is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
effective january   revenue is no longer subject to adjustment if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period 
however  there are now multiple thresholds for the number of therapy visits to be provided  increasing the complexity in determining the correct reimbursement rate  which may result in a greater number of episodes that are subject to revenue adjustments  although the adjustment amount per episode would decline 
deferred revenue of approximately million and million primarily relating to the pps program was included in deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively 
medicare settlement issues under interim payment system prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home healthcare services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs were reported in annual cost reports which were filed with cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
although management believes that established reserves related to the open fiscal cost report year are sufficient  it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits could exceed established reserves and could have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these reserves are reflected in medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company periodically reviews its established audit reserves for appropriateness and records any adjustments or settlements as net revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income 
there have not been any material revisions in established reserves for the periods presented in this filing 
settlement liabilities are recorded at the time of any probable and reasonably estimable event and any positive settlements are recorded as revenue in the company s consolidated statements of income in the period in which such gain contingencies are realized 
as discussed further under the heading government matters prrb appeal in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  the company received and recorded an aggregate of million during fiscal in settlement of the company s appeal filed with the prrb related to the reopening of all of its and cost reports 
during fiscal  the company 
table of contents received and recorded million in partial settlement of the prrb appeal relating to its cost reports
