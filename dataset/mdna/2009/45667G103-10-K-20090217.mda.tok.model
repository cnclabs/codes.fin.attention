risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and in other documents we file with the sec  are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
we have a history of significant operating losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability on an annual basis in the future 
we achieved profitability for the first time on an annual basis for the year ended december  and generated net income of million 
however the recognition of million of deferred revenue from prior periods and the increased upfront recognition of revenue from current period shipments  due to the attainment of vsoe of fair value for our services  resulted in elevated revenue levels for the year 
we expect revenue for future periods to more closely approximate the level of underlying invoiced shipments in that period 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures related to the continued development of our business 
these expenditures may include the addition of personnel related to the sales  marketing and research and development of our dtn system and other costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our manufacturing facilities and research and development operations 
we may therefore sustain significant operating losses and negative cash flows in the future 
in addition  as a public company  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses 
we will have to sustain significant increased revenue and product gross margins to maintain profitability on an annual basis 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on past results  in particular the recent growth in our revenue  as an indicator of our future performance 
fluctuations in our revenue can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating results 
our budgeted expense levels depend in part on our expectations of long term future revenue 
given relatively fixed operating costs related to our personnel and facilities  any substantial adjustment to our expenses to account for lower levels of revenue will be difficult and may take time 
consequently  if our revenue does not meet projected levels  our inventory levels and operating expenses would be high relative to revenue  resulting in additional operating losses 
in addition to other risks discussed in this section  factors that may contribute to fluctuations in our revenue and our operating results include fluctuations in demand  sales cycles  product mix and prices for our dtn system and our services  reductions in customers budgets for optical communications purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles  order cancellations or reductions or delays in delivery schedules by our customers  timeliness of our customers payments for their purchases  our ability to control costs  including our operating expenses and the costs of components we purchase  
table of contents readiness of customer sites for installation of our dtn system  the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors  our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for any future service that we may offer to a customer and to recognize revenue once the other revenue recognition criteria have been met  rather than ratably over the longest undelivered service period  availability of third party suppliers to provide contract engineering and installation services for us  any significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our market  including any new entrants  technological advances or substantial discounting of products  the timing of recognizing revenue in any given quarter as a result of software revenue recognition requirements and any changes in us generally accepted accounting principles or new interpretations of existing accounting rules  and general economic conditions in domestic and international markets 
if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may in the future provide to the market  the price of our common stock may decline substantially 
our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be adversely affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our gross margin fluctuates from period to period and varies by customer and by product specification 
our gross margin may continue to be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the mix in any period of higher and lower margin products and services  price discounts negotiated by our customers  sales volume from each customer during the period  the amount of equipment we sell or expect to sell for a loss in any given quarter  charges for excess or obsolete inventory  changes in the price or availability of components for our dtn system  changes in our manufacturing costs  including fluctuations in yields and production volumes  introduction of new products  with initial sales at relatively small volumes and higher product costs  increased price competition  including competition from low cost producers in china  increased warranty or repair costs  and the period of time over which ratable recognition of revenue occurs 
it is likely that the average unit prices of our dtn system will decrease over time in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased negotiated sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
in addition  some of our customer contracts contain annual technology discounts that require us to decrease the sales price of our dtn system to these customers 
in response  we will need to reduce the cost of our dtn system through manufacturing efficiencies  design improvements and cost reductions or change the mix of the dtn systems we sell 
if these efforts are not successful or if we are unable to reduce our costs to a greater extent than the 
table of contents reduction in the price of our dtn system  our revenue and gross margin will decline  causing our operating results to decline 
fluctuations in gross margin may make it difficult to manage our business and achieve or maintain profitability 
aggressive business tactics by our competitors may harm our business 
increased competition in our markets has resulted in aggressive business tactics by our competitors  including selling at a discount used equipment or inventory that a competitor had previously written down or written off  announcing competing products prior to market availability combined with extensive marketing efforts  offering to repurchase our equipment from existing customers  providing financing  marketing and advertising assistance to customers  and asserting intellectual property rights 
if we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  or if our current or future competitors continue or expand aggressive business tactics  including those described above  demand for our dtn system could decline  we could experience delays or cancellations of customer orders  or we could be required to reduce our prices or increase our expenses 
our ability to increase our revenue will depend upon continued growth of demand by consumers and businesses for additional network capacity 
our future success depends on factors such as the continued growth of the internet and internet protocol traffic and the continuing adoption of high capacity  revenue generating services to increase the amount of data transmitted over communications networks and the growth of optical communications networks to meet the increased demand for bandwidth 
if demand for such bandwidth does not continue  or slows down  the need for increased bandwidth across networks and the market for optical communications network products may not continue to grow 
if this growth does not continue or slows down  our dtn system sales would be negatively impacted 
in addition  if general economic conditions weaken  this may cause our customers and potential customers to slow or delay their purchase decisions  which would have an adverse affect on our business and financial condition 
recent turmoil in the financial markets and the global recession has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industry  business and gross margins 
the us and world economic markets are undergoing a period of slowdown or recession  and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable than that of recent years 
our business depends on the overall demand for additional bandwidth capacity and on the economic health and willingness of our customers and potential customers to make capital commitments to purchase our products and services 
as a result of this slowdown  we may face new risks that we have not yet identified 
in addition  a number of the risks associated with our business  which are disclosed in these risk factors  may increase in likelihood  magnitude or duration 
if the conditions in the us and world economic markets remain uncertain or continue to be volatile  or if they deteriorate further  our industry  business and gross margins may be adversely affected 
as a result of this economic slowdown and the continued tightening of credit markets  our customers may be delayed in obtaining  or may not be able to obtain  necessary financing for their purchases of our products 
a lack of liquidity in the capital markets or the continued global recession 
table of contents may cause our customers to delay or cancel their purchases  increase the time they take to pay or default on their payment obligations  each of which would negatively affect our results 
continued weakness in the economy could cause some of our customers to become illiquid  delay payments or adversely affect our collection on their accounts  which could result in a higher level of bad debt expense 
at december   million was reserved for accounts receivable bad debt associated with one customer as they were deemed uncollectible 
in addition  currency fluctuations relating to the financial crisis could negatively affect our international customers ability or desire to purchase our products 
challenging economic conditions have from time to time contributed  and are currently contributing  to slowdowns in the telecommunications industry in which we operate 
this slowdown may result in reduced demand for our products as a result of constraints on capital spending by our customers  particularly service providers  increased price competition for our products  not only from our competitors  but also as a result of our customer s or potential customer s utilization of inventoried or underutilized products  which could put additional pressure on our near term gross profits  risk of excess or obsolete inventories  excess manufacturing capacity and higher associated overhead costs as a percentage of revenue  and more limited ability to accurately forecast our business and future financial performance 
the lack of liquidity and economic slowdown may adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products from these suppliers 
it may also cause some of our suppliers to become illiquid 
any of these impacts could limit our ability to obtain components for our products from these suppliers and could adversely impact our supply chain or the delivery schedule to our customers 
this also could require us to purchase more expensive components  or re design our dtn system  which could cause increases in the cost of our systems and delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our systems 
such events could harm our gross margins and harm our reputation and our customer relationships  either of which could harm our business and operating results 
we have a limited operating history and limited history of selling our dtn system  both of which make it difficult to predict our future operating results 
we were incorporated in december and shipped our first dtn system in november our limited operating history gives you very little basis upon which to evaluate our ability to accomplish our business objectives 
in making an investment decision  you should evaluate our business in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in the rapidly changing optical communications market 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks 
it is difficult to accurately forecast our future revenue and plan expenses accordingly and  therefore  predict our future operating results 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and dominated by large corporations  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
competition in the optical communications equipment market is intense  and we expect such competition to increase 
a number of very large companies historically have dominated the optical communications network equipment industry 
our competitors include current wavelength division multiplexing suppliers  such as alcatel lucent  ciena corporation  cisco systems  ericsson  fujitsu limited  huawei technologies co  nec corporation  nokia siemens networks  nortel networks  
table of contents tellabs and zte corporation 
competition in these markets is based on price  functionality  manufacturing capability  pre existing installation  services  existing business and customer relationships  scalability and the ability of products and breadth and quality of services to meet our customers immediate and future network requirements 
other companies have  or may in the future develop  products that are or could be competitive with our dtn system 
in particular  if a competitor develops a photonic integrated circuit with similar functionality  our business could be harmed 
recent mergers from our competitors and any future acquisitions or combinations between or among our competitors may adversely affect our competitive position by strengthening our competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources  greater manufacturing capacity and better established relationships with incumbent carriers and other potential customers than we have 
many of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire  and more experience in developing or acquiring  new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for those products and technologies 
in addition  many of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at below market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively 
further  many of our competitors have built long standing relationships with some of our prospective customers and have the ability to provide financing to customers and could  therefore  have an inherent advantage in selling products to those customers 
we also compete with low cost producers in china that can increase pricing pressure on us and a number of smaller companies that provide competition for a specific product  customer segment or geographic market 
these competitors often base their products on the latest available technologies 
due to the narrower focus of their efforts  these competitors may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly than we can and may provide attractive alternatives to our customers 
we are dependent on level communications for a significant portion of our revenue and the loss of  or a significant reduction in orders from  level communications or one or more of our key customers would reduce our revenue and harm our operating results 
a relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of our net revenue 
in particular  for  level communications  or level  accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we expect level to continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our business will be harmed if we do not generate as much revenue as we expect from our key customers  particularly from level  if we experience a loss of level or of any of our other key customers or if we suffer a substantial reduction in orders from these customers 
our business also would be harmed if level or any of our other key customers believed that a competitor offered a more compelling economic solution to their network requirements 
our ability to continue to generate revenue from our key customers will depend on our ability to maintain strong relationships with these customers and introduce new products that are desirable to these customers at competitive prices  and we may not be successful doing so 
because  in most cases  our sales are made to these customers pursuant to standard purchase agreements rather than long term purchase commitments  orders may be cancelled or reduced readily 
in the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order  we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business 
our operating results will continue to depend on our ability to sell our dtn system to level and other large customers 
our large customers have substantial negotiating leverage  which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that result in increased cost of sales  decreased revenue and lower average selling prices and gross margins  all of which would harm our operating results 
substantial changes in the optical communications industry have occurred over the last few years 
many potential customers have confronted static or declining revenue 
many of our customers have 
table of contents substantial debt burdens  many have experienced financial distress  and some have gone out of business or have been acquired by other service providers or announced their withdrawal from segments of the business 
consolidation in the markets in which we compete has resulted in changes in the structure of the communications networking industry  with greater concentration of purchasing power in a small number of large service providers  cable operators and government agencies 
in addition  it has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of our potential customers 
for example  service providers  such as level  have acquired a number of other communications service providers  including one of our other customers 
this increased concentration among our customer base may also lead to increased negotiating power for our customers and may require us to decrease our average selling prices 
further  many of our customers are large communications service providers that have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us 
our customers have and may continue to seek advantageous pricing and other commercial terms and may require us to develop additional features in the products we sell to them 
we have and may continue to be required to agree to unfavorable commercial terms with these customers  including reducing the average selling price of our dtn system in response to these commercial requirements or competitive pricing pressures 
to maintain acceptable operating results  we will need to comply with these commercial terms  develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continue to reduce our costs 
we expect the factors described above to continue to affect our business and operating results for an indeterminate period  in several ways  including overall capital expenditures by many of our customers or potential customers may be flat or reduced  we will continue to have only limited ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales  managing expenditures and inventory will be difficult in light of the uncertainties surrounding our business  and increased competition will enable customers to insist on more favorable terms and conditions for sales  including product discounts  extended payment terms or financing assistance  as a condition of procuring their business 
if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices or increases in our average costs with increased sales volumes and reduced production costs  or if we fail to develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis  or if we disagree on our interpretation and compliance with the commercial terms of our customer agreements  our relationships with our customers and our operating results would be harmed 
we are dependent on a single product  and the lack of continued market acceptance of our dtn system would harm our business 
our dtn system accounts for substantially all of our revenue and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our business could be harmed by any decline in demand for our dtn system  the failure of our existing dtn system to achieve continued market acceptance  the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for  or represent an improvement over  our dtn system  
table of contents technological innovations or new communications standards that our dtn system does not address  and our inability to release enhanced versions of our dtn system on a timely basis 
if we fail to expand sales of our dtn system into international markets or to sell our products to new types of customers  such as us regional bell operating companies and international postal  telephone and telegraph companies  our revenue will be harmed 
we believe that  in order to grow our revenue and business and to build a large and diverse customer base  we must successfully sell our dtn system in international markets and to new types of customers  such as us regional bell operating companies and international postal  telephone and telegraph companies 
we have limited experience selling our dtn system internationally and to us regional bell operating companies and international postal  telephone and telegraph companies 
to succeed in these sales efforts  we believe we must hire additional sales personnel and develop and manage new sales channels through resellers  distributors and systems integrators 
if we do not succeed in our efforts to sell to these target markets and customers  the size of our total addressable market will be limited 
this  in turn  would harm our ability to grow our customer base and revenue 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could be harmed or we could incur significant expense to enforce our rights 
we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  all of which offer only limited protection 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights  and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain  particularly in countries outside of the united states 
this is likely to become an increasingly important issue as we expand our operations and product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims  and even if patents are issued  they may be contested  circumvented or invalidated 
moreover  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with a competitive advantage  and  as with any technology  competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future 
protecting against the unauthorized use of our dtn system  trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive  difficult  time consuming and  in some cases  impossible 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management resources  either of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do 
accordingly  despite our efforts  we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 
claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could harm our business 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  many leading companies in the optical communications industry  including our competitors  have extensive patent portfolios with respect to optical communications technology 
we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur 
from 
table of contents time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are important to our business or seek to invalidate the proprietary rights that we hold 
competitors or other third parties have  and may continue to assert claims or initiate litigation or other proceedings against us or our manufacturers  suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights  or seeking to invalidate our proprietary rights  with respect to our dtn system and technology 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in defending against any such claims  or any resulting lawsuit or proceedings  we could incur liability for damages and or have valuable proprietary rights invalidated 
any claim of infringement from a third party  even one without merit  could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  and could distract our management from running our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim  if successful  could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our dtn system 
in addition  we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
alternatively  we may be required to develop non infringing technology  which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful 
any of these events could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
competitors and other third parties have and may continue to assert infringement claims against our customers and sales partners 
any of these claims would require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf  regardless of the merits of these claims  because we generally indemnify our customers and sales partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or sales partners  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
on may   we and level were sued by cheetah in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas texarkana division for alleged infringement of patent no 
 and a continuation thereof 
on may   cheetah filed an amended complaint  which requested an order to enjoin the sale of our dtn system  recovery of all damages caused by the alleged infringement and an award of any and all compensatory damages available by law  including damages  attorneys fees  associated interest and cheetah s costs incurred in the lawsuit 
cheetah s complaint does not request a specific dollar amount of damages 
we are contractually obligated to indemnify level for damages suffered by level to the extent our product is found to infringe the rights of a third party  and we have assumed the defense of this matter 
on july   we and level filed an amended response 
on november   cheetah filed a second amended complaint and added patent no 
 to the lawsuit 
on december   we and level filed responses to cheetah s second amended complaint 
on january   cheetah filed a third amended complaint adding additional assertions of infringement for the two patents in suit 
on february   we and level filed responses to cheetah s third amended complaint 
on april   we  level and cheetah filed a joint motion with the court  agreeing to the following to stay all proceedings in the lawsuit pending a determination by the us patent and trademark office as to whether it will reexamine us patent nos 
 and  and if the us patent and trademark office decides to reexamine either us patent no 
 or  to stay all proceedings in the lawsuit pending final resolution of the reexamination s by the us patent and trademark office 
on april   the court granted the motion staying all proceedings in the lawsuit 
on june   the us patent and trademark office ordered reexamination of us patent no 
 on august   the us patent and trademark office ordered reexamination of us patent no 
 as a result  all proceedings in this lawsuit are stayed until the final resolution of these reexaminations 
we do not know when the us patent and trademark office reexamination process will be completed 
in the event that cheetah is successful in obtaining a judgment requiring us to pay damages or obtains an injunction preventing the sale of our dtn system  our business could be harmed 

table of contents our manufacturing process is very complex and the partial or complete loss of our manufacturing facility  or a reduction in yields or an inability to scale capacity to meet customer demands could harm our business 
the manufacturing process for certain components of our products  including our pic  and for our dtn system is technically challenging 
in the event that any of these manufacturing facilities was fully or partially destroyed  as a result of fire  water damage  or otherwise  it would limit our ability to produce our dtn system 
because of the complex nature of our manufacturing facilities  such loss would take a considerable amount of time to repair or rebuild 
the partial or complete loss of any of our manufacturing facilities  or an event causing the interruption in our use of such facility for any extended period of time would cause our business  financial condition and operating results to be harmed 
minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yields and  in some cases  cause production to be suspended 
we have had production interruptions and suspensions in the past and may have additional interruptions or suspensions in the future 
we expect our manufacturing yield for our next generation pics to be lower initially and increase as we achieve full production 
poor yields from our pic manufacturing process or defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our dtn system could cause us customer relations and business reputation problems  harming our business and operating results 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities may not have adequate capacity to meet the demand for our dtn system or we may not be able to increase our capacity to meet potential increases in demand for our dtn system 
our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties  could harm our relationships with customers  our business and our operating results 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our dtn system  we may have excess or insufficient inventory  which may increase our operating costs  decrease our revenue and harm our business 
we are required to generate forecasts of future demands for our dtn system several months prior to the scheduled delivery to our prospective customers  which requires us to make significant investments before we know if corresponding revenue will be recognized 
if we overestimate demand for our dtn system or particular elements of our dtn system and increase our inventory in anticipation of customer orders that do not materialize  we will have excess inventory  we will face a risk of obsolescence and significant inventory write downs and our capital infrastructure will be depreciated across fewer units raising our per unit costs 
if we underestimate demand for our dtn system  we will have inadequate inventory  which could slow down or interrupt the manufacturing of our dtn system and result in delays in shipments and our ability to recognize revenue 
in addition  we may be unable to meet our supply commitments to customers which could result in a breach of our customer agreements and require us to pay damages 
lead times for materials and components  including application specific integrated circuits  that we need to order for the manufacturing of our dtn system vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at a given time 
product performance problems  including undetected errors in our hardware or software  or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation 
the development and production of new products with high technology content  such as our dtn system  is complicated and often involves problems with software  components and manufacturing methods 
complex hardware and software products  such as our dtn system  can often contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have experienced errors in the past in connection with our dtn system  including failures due to the receipt of faulty 
table of contents components from our suppliers 
we suspect that errors  including potentially serious errors  will be found from time to time in our dtn system 
we have been shipping our dtn system since november  which provides us with limited information on which to judge its reliability 
our dtn system may suffer degradation of performance and reliability over time 
if reliability  quality or network monitoring problems develop  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including delays in our ability to recognize revenue  costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects or replacing products  high service and warranty expenses  delays in shipments  high inventory excess and obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  delays in collecting accounts receivable  payment of damages for performance failures  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
because we outsource the manufacturing of certain components of our dtn system  we may also be subject to product performance problems as a result of the acts or omissions of these third parties 
from time to time  we encounter interruptions or delays in the activation of our dtn system at a customers site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from issues with installation and activation  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that we cannot promptly resolve  the associated revenue for these installations may be delayed or confidence in our dtn system could be undermined  which could cause us to lose customers and fail to add new customers 
we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components  and if we fail to obtain these components on a timely basis  we will not meet our customers product delivery requirements 
we currently purchase several key components from single or limited sources 
in particular  we rely on our own production of certain components of our dtn system  such as pics  and on third parties as sole source suppliers for certain of the components of our system  including application specific integrated circuits  field programmable gate arrays  processors  and other semiconductor and optical components 
we purchase these items on a purchase order basis and have no long term contracts with most of these sole source suppliers 
if any of our sole or limited source suppliers suffer from capacity constraints  lower than expected yields  work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output  they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule 
further  our suppliers could enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  refuse to sell their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all  go out of business or discontinue their relationships with us 
we may be unable to develop alternative sources for these components 
if we do not receive critical components for our dtn system in a timely manner  we will be unable to deliver those components to our manufacturer in a timely manner and would  therefore  be unable to meet our prospective customers product delivery requirements 
in addition  the sourcing from new 
table of contents suppliers may require us to re design our dtn system  which could cause delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our systems 
in the past  we have experienced delivery delays because of lack of availability of components or reliability issues with components that we were purchasing 
in addition  some of our sole suppliers have gone out of business  limited their supply of components to us  or indicated that they may be going out of business 
these supplier disruptions may continue to occur in the future  which could limit our ability to produce the dtn system and cause us to fail to meet a customer s delivery requirements 
such events could harm our reputation and our customer relationships  either of which could harm our business and operating results 
we have experienced delays in the development and introduction of our dtn system  and any future delays in releasing new products or in releasing enhancements to our dtn system may harm our business 
since our dtn system is based on complex technology  we may experience unanticipated delays in developing  improving  manufacturing or deploying it 
any modification to our pic and to our dtn system entails similar development risks 
at any given time  various new product introductions and enhancements to our dtn system are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment 
the maturing process from laboratory prototype to customer trials  and subsequently to general availability  involves a number of steps  including completion of product development  the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components  validation of manufacturing methods and processes  extensive quality assurance and reliability testing  and staffing of testing infrastructure  validation of software  and establishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements 
each of these steps  in turn  presents risks of failure  rework or delay  any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of our products 
new versions of our pics  specialized application specific integrated circuits and intensive software testing and validation are important to the timely introduction of new product introductions and enhancements to our dtn system and to our ability to enter new markets  and schedule delays are common 
in addition  unexpected intellectual property disputes  failure of critical design elements  and a host of other execution risks may delay or even prevent the introduction of enhancements to our dtn system 
if we do not develop and successfully introduce products in a timely manner  our competitive position may suffer 
our investments in adjustable rate securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 
at december   we held million par value of investments comprised of adjustable rate securities  or ars  which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest rate being reset through auctions that are typically held every  or days 
these securities have historically traded at par and were callable at par at the option of the issuer 
interest was typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually 
at december   all of the ars we held were aaa rated  with most collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
since february  most of the auctions for these securities have failed and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the par value in the near term from our ars is limited and it could take until final maturity of the 
table of contents ars up to years to realize our investments par value 
in the event we need to access these funds  we may not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful  a secondary market develops or the securities are redeemed by the broker dealer 
in october  we elected to participate in a rights offering by ubs financial services  inc ubs  one of our brokers  which provides us with certain rights the put rights to sell ubs million par value of the ars  which we purchased through ubs back to ubs at par value  at any time during a two year sale period beginning june  by electing to participate in the rights offering  we granted ubs the right  exercisable at any time prior to june  or during the two year sale period  to purchase or cause the sale of our ars call right 
as such  we recorded a gain of million related to the put rights provided by the settlement and a gross unrealized loss of million related to the million par value portion of our ars portfolio as we may decide not to hold these securities until final maturity because of the opportunity provided by the put rights 
the ars and the put rights will be revalued to fair market value on a quarterly basis until the sale of these securities has been completed 
in addition  we recorded an unrealized loss of million under accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under stockholders equity as of december  related to the remaining million of the company s ars which are not subject to the ubs settlement and which we intend to hold until the par value can be recovered 
if the issuers of the adjustable rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions or refinance their debt in the near term and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record further impairment charges on these investments and may liquidate these investments for less than their face value 
in addition  if ubs is unable to honor our put rights  the fair value of our put rights may be reduced to zero  thus adversely affecting our financial position and capital resources 
we must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our dtn system to be successful 
the optical communications equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of new communications technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or requirements could render our dtn system obsolete 
further  in developing our dtn system  we have made  and will continue to make  assumptions with respect to which standards or requirements will be adopted by our customers and competitors 
if the standards or requirements adopted by our prospective customers are different from those on which we have focused our efforts  market acceptance of our dtn system would be reduced or delayed and our business would be harmed 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their existing products and to introduce new products and technologies 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments  we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive and we may not be able to effectively sell our dtn system to customers who have prior relationships with our competitors 
if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future  the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 
assessing our processes  procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process 
for the year ended december   management became obligated to comply for the first time with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and has issued a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
also  
table of contents for the year ended december   an attestation report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been issued for the first time by ernst young  llp  independent registered public accounting firm 
preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes  many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review 
these processes include  but are not limited to  calculating revenue  deferred revenue and inventory costs 
while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review and put in place controls to reduce the likelihood for errors  we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 
in the past  we have identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
we have remediated these identified material weaknesses  but we cannot give any assurances that all material weaknesses have been identified or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future in connection with our compliance with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of the existence of one or more material weaknesses could preclude a conclusion by management that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 
the existence or disclosure of any such material weakness could adversely affect our stock price 
if we lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional qualified personnel when needed  our business may be harmed 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  and finance personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
for example  senior members of our engineering team have unique technical experience that would be difficult to replace 
we do not have long term employment contracts or key person life insurance covering any of our key personnel 
because our dtn system is complex  we must hire and retain a large number of highly trained customer service and support personnel to ensure that the deployment of our dtn system does not result in network disruption for our customers 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing  finance and customer service and support personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense in our industry  especially in the san francisco bay area 
we may not succeed in identifying  attracting and retaining appropriate personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
our sales cycle can be long and unpredictable  which could result in an unexpected revenue shortfall in any given quarter 
our dtn system has a lengthy sales cycle  which can extend from six to twelve months and may take even longer for larger prospective customers such as us regional bell operating companies  international postal  telephone and telegraph companies and us competitive local exchange carriers 
our prospective customers conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they purchase our dtn system 
we incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort during this time  regardless of whether we make a sale 
because the purchase of our equipment involves substantial cost  most of our customers wait to purchase our equipment until they are ready to deploy it in their network 
as a result  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the timing of future purchases by our customers 
in addition  product purchases are often subject to budget constraints  multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays 
if sales expected from customers for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all  our revenue will be negatively impacted 

table of contents our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may harm our operating results 
we market  sell and service our dtn system globally 
in  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue from customers outside of the united states 
we have sales and support personnel in numerous countries worldwide 
in addition  we have a large group of software development personnel located in bangalore  india and a group of hardware and software development engineers located in beijing  china 
we expect that significant management attention and financial resources will be required for our international activities over the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our international presence 
in some countries  our successes in selling the dtn system will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners 
our inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for international sales of our dtn system could impact our ability to maintain or increase international market demand for our dtn system 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  difficulties of managing and staffing international offices  and the increased travel  infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  tariff and trade barriers and other regulatory requirements or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our dtn system in certain foreign markets  certification requirements  greater difficulty documenting and testing our internal controls  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  political and economic instability  effects of changes in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows 
service provider and government spending patterns 
international customers may also require that we comply with certain testing or customization of our dtn system to conform to local standards 
the product development costs to test or customize our dtn system could be extensive and a material expense for us 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations 
our failure to manage any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales 

table of contents if our contract manufacturers do not perform as we expect  our business may be harmed 
our future success will depend on our ability to have sufficient volumes of our dtn system manufactured in a cost effective and quality controlled manner 
we have engaged third parties to manufacture certain elements of our dtn system and are in the process of qualifying non us contract manufacturing sites 
there are a number of risks associated with our dependence on contract manufacturers  including reduced control over delivery schedules  particularly for international contract manufacturing sites  reliance on the quality assurance procedures of third parties  potential uncertainty regarding manufacturing yields and costs  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  potential uncertainty related to the use of international contract manufacturing sites  limited warranties on components supplied to us  potential misappropriation of our intellectual property  and potential manufacturing disruptions 
any of these risks could impair our ability to fulfill orders 
our contract manufacturers may not be able to meet the delivery requirements of our customers  which could decrease customer satisfaction and harm our dtn system sales 
we do not have long term contracts or arrangements with our contract manufacturers that will guarantee product availability  or the continuation of particular pricing or payment terms 
if our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our dtn system in required volumes or our relationship with any of our contract manufacturers is discontinued for any reason  we would be required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturers  which could cause us to be unable to meet our supply requirements to our customers and result in the breach of our customer agreements 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming and if we are required to change or qualify a new contract manufacturer  we would likely lose sales revenue and damage our existing customer relationships 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operations 
we have made strategic acquisitions of businesses  technologies and other assets in the past 
while we have no current agreements or commitments  we may in the future acquire businesses  product lines or technologies 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals  or they may be viewed negatively by customers  financial markets or investors and we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume other liabilities  or incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and or incur large and immediate write offs 
acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the acquired operations  technologies or products with our own  diversion of management s attention from our core business  assumption of unknown liabilities  
table of contents adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  increased accounting compliance risk  risks associated with entering new markets  and potential loss of key employees 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future 
our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our use and reliance upon development resources in india may expose us to unanticipated costs or liabilities 
we have established a development center in india and expect to continue to increase hiring of personnel for this facility 
there is no assurance that our reliance upon development resources in india will enable us to achieve meaningful cost reductions or greater resource efficiency 
further  our development efforts and other operations in india involve significant risks  including difficulty hiring and retaining appropriate engineering resources due to intense competition for such resources and resulting wage inflation  the knowledge transfer related to our technology and exposure to misappropriation of intellectual property or confidential information  including information that is proprietary to us  our customers and other third parties  heightened exposure to changes in the economic  security and political conditions of india  fluctuation in currency exchange rates and tax risks associated with international operations  and development efforts that do not meet our requirements because of language  cultural or other differences associated with international operations  resulting in errors or delays 
difficulties resulting from the factors above and other risks related to our operations in india could expose us to increased expense  impair our development efforts  harm our competitive position and damage our reputation 
unforeseen health  safety and environmental costs could harm our business 
our manufacturing operations use substances that are regulated by various federal  state and international laws governing health  safety and the environment 
if we experience a problem with these substances  it could cause an interruption or delay in our manufacturing operations or could cause us to incur liabilities for any costs related to health  safety or environmental remediation 
we could also be subject to liability if we do not handle these substances in compliance with safety standards for storage and transportation and applicable laws 
if we experience a problem or fail to comply with such safety standards  our business  financial condition and operating results may be harmed 
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 
we are subject to export control laws that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our dtn system 
us export control laws also limit our ability to conduct product development activities in certain countries 
in addition  various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our dtn system or could limit our customers ability to implement our dtn system in those countries 
changes in our dtn system or changes in 
table of contents export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our dtn system in international markets  prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our dtn system throughout their global systems or  in some cases  prevent the export or import of our dtn system to certain countries altogether 
any change in export or import regulations or related legislation  shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations  or change in the countries  persons or technologies targeted by such regulations  could result in decreased use of our dtn system by  or in our decreased ability to export or sell our dtn system to  existing or potential customers with international operations 
for example  we need to comply with waste from electrical and electronic equipment and restriction of hazardous substances laws  which have been adopted by certain european economic area countries on a country by country basis 
failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis  or at all  decreased use of our dtn system or any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we need additional capital in the future  it may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
our business requires significant capital 
we have historically relied on significant outside debt and equity financing as well as cash flow from operations to fund our operations  capital expenditures and expansion 
we may require additional capital from equity or debt financings in the future to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities in the event that we continue to incur significant losses  we are unable to liquidate our auction rate securities or otherwise 
we may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity  convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity  our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our company  and any new securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us  if and when we require it  our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited and our business will be harmed 
we are subject to government regulations that could adversely impact our business 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has jurisdiction over the entire us communications industry and  as a result  our dtn system and our north american customers are subject to fcc rules and regulations 
current and future fcc regulations affecting communications services  our dtn system or our customers businesses could negatively affect our business 
in addition  international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop products for international customers in the future 
delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of product orders 
further  we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory approvals that may  in the future  be required to operate our business 
any failure to obtain such approvals could harm our business and operating results 
natural disasters  terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 
our headquarters and the majority of our infrastructure  including our pic manufacturing facility  are located in northern california  an area that is susceptible to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
further  a terrorist attack aimed at northern california or at our nation s energy or telecommunications infrastructure could hinder or delay the development and sale of our dtn system 
in the event that an earthquake  terrorist attack or other catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities  or certain of our contract manufacturers facilities  destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time  our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed 

table of contents the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future 
the trading prices of our common stock and the securities of other technology companies have been and may continue to be highly volatile 
further  our common stock has limited prior trading history 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new services or service enhancements  strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors  the gain or loss of customers  recruitment or departure of key personnel  changes in the estimates of our future operating results or external guidance on those results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock  market conditions in our industry  the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole  and adoption or modification of regulations  policies  procedures or programs applicable to our business 
in addition  if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence  the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business  financial condition or operating results 
the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us 
each of these factors  among others  could harm the value of your investment in our common stock 
some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them 
if a suit were filed against us  regardless of its merits or outcome  it could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
if no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company  the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted 
if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 
we are a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which apply to us  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a change in our 
table of contents management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws authorize the issuance of blank check convertible preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt  establish a classified board of directors  as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election  require that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote  provide that vacancies on the board of directors  including newly created directorships  may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office rather than by stockholders  prevent stockholders from calling special meetings  and prohibit stockholder action by written consent  requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders

item legal proceedings on may   we and level were sued by cheetah omni llc  or cheetah  in the us district court for the eastern district of texas texarkana division for alleged infringement of patent no 
 and a continuation thereof 
on may   cheetah filed an amended complaint  which requested an order to enjoin the sale of our dtn system and to recover all damages caused by the alleged willful infringement including any and all compensatory damages available by law  such as actual and punitive damages  attorneys fees  associated interest and cheetah s costs incurred in the lawsuit 
cheetah s complaint does not request a specific dollar amount for these compensatory damages 
we are contractually obligated to indemnify level for damages suffered by level to the extent its product is found to infringe  and it has assumed the defense of this matter 
on july   we and level filed an amended response denying all infringement claims under patent no 
 and asserting that the claims of the patent are invalid and that the dtn system does not infringe the patent

on february   we and level filed responses to cheetah s third amended complaint denying all infringement claims  and we and level asserted counterclaims against cheetah asserting that the claims of the patents are invalid and that the dtn system does not infringe the patents 
on march   we submitted requests to the us patent and trademark office for inter partes reexamination of us patent nos 
 and  asking the us patent and trademark office to reexamine the patents based on prior art in order to invalidate the patents or limit the scope of each patent s claims 
on march   we and level filed a motion with the court to stay all proceedings in the lawsuit pending the reexamination of us patent nos 
 and on april   we  level and cheetah filed a joint motion with the court  agreeing to the following to stay all proceedings in the lawsuit pending a determination by the us patent and trademark office as to whether it will reexamine us patent nos 
 and  and if the us patent and trademark office decides to reexamine either us patent no 
 or  to stay all proceedings in the lawsuit pending final resolution of the reexamination s by the us patent and trademark office 
on april   the court granted the motion staying all proceedings in the lawsuit 
on june   the us patent and trademark office ordered reexamination of us patent no 
 on august   the us patent and trademark office ordered reexamination of us patent no 
 as a result  all proceedings in this lawsuit are stayed until the final resolution of these reexaminations 
we believe the suit is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously  but we are unable to predict the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome 
in addition to the matters described above  we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable  we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview infinera was founded in december with a unique vision for optical networking 
prior to infinera  service provider optical networks were built from fairly commoditized products  broadly known as dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm systems 
the pace of bandwidth growth in service provider networks has been significant over the last few years 
thus each year  service providers generally have been consuming more space  more power  and more of their human resources to deploy and manage their optical networks 
the infinera vision is that photonic integration offers a solution to this problem 
photonic integration is predicated upon the belief that  it is possible to generate a moore s law like continuous improvement in capacity per device or chip to help service providers scale their network bandwidth without significant increases in space  power or operational workload 
infinera s product offering is a digital optical networking system dtn system 
the dtn system uses photonic integrated circuits  or pics  to generate g of optical capacity per line card 
this capacity is then digitally virtualized so that it can be allocated  using software  to a variety of service types 
the dtn system includes intelligent software that is designed to simplify and speed the delivery and control of optical services  and to enable advanced feature capabilities 
photonic integration provides the basis for the dtn system s power and space advantages relative to conventional dwdm systems  while the dtn system s bandwidth virtualization capability and software intelligence are architected to allow infinera customers to simplify and speed their operations tasks  and ultimately to improve operational efficiency 

table of contents infinera s digital optical networking architecture is made possible by what we believe to be the world s only commercially deployed  large scale pic 
our pics transmit and receive gbps of optical capacity and incorporate the functionality of over discrete optical components into a pair of indium phosphide chips 
their function is to convert gbps of optical capacity into electronic signals 
once electronic  these signals can be virtualized and allocated to a number of services using digital technology 
the pics are in effect the heart of the dtn system  as they are the key to its ability to deliver a wide range of transport services  with optional advanced features  quickly and easily 
by contrast  competitive dwdm platforms  which do not have access to pic technology  generally require photonics equipment to add new services to the network 
photonic engineering can be considerably slower and more difficult than digital engineering  as a result  we believe competitive platforms have less flexibility  take longer to provision  and are harder to operate than the dtn system 
our goal is to be a leading provider of optical communications systems to operators of optical networks  including telecom carriers  cable operators  internet or content service providers  and others 
our revenue growth will depend on the continued acceptance of our dtn system  growth of communications traffic and the proliferation of next generation bandwidth intensive services  which are expected to drive the need for increased levels of bandwidth 
our ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability will be directly affected by the level of acceptance of our products in the long haul and metro dwdm markets and by our ability to cost effectively develop and sell innovative products that leverage our technology advantages 
we are headquartered in sunnyvale  california  with employees located throughout the united states  europe and the asia pacific region 
we expect to continue to add personnel in the united states and internationally to develop our product and provide additional geographic sales and technical support coverage 
we primarily sell our products through our direct sales force  with a small portion sold indirectly through resellers 
we derived of our revenue from direct sales to customers for the years ended december  and december  we expect to continue generating a substantial majority of our revenue from direct sales in the future 
our revenue growth is directly impacted by underlying growth in invoiced shipments 
our near term year over year and quarter over quarter growth in invoiced shipments may be impacted by several factors including general economic and market conditions  the timing of large product deployments  acquisitions of new customers and new products and will likely be volatile 
in addition  the timing at which we recognize revenue is directly impacted by our ability to establish and maintain vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our services offerings 
the attainment of vsoe of fair value on software subscription services and for training and installation and deployment services in resulted in an increased portion of our shipments for the period being recognized as product and service revenue at the time of acceptance 
this change resulted in a significant increase in the amount of revenue recognized from shipments and a significant reduction in additions to deferred revenue during the year and in the deferred revenue balance at the end of the year 
this increase in the recognition of revenue from shipments  combined with the recognition of million of deferred revenue from the prior years resulted in elevated revenues in as outlined above  the attainment of vsoe of fair value on most of our services in allowed us to recognize the majority of our shipments as revenue at the time of acceptance and in addition to allocate that revenue to the appropriate revenue category in our consolidated statements of operations 
this resulted in increased levels of product and services revenue offset by a reduction in ratable revenue 
ratable revenue in future periods is expected to include a small portion of revenues related to products sold in combination with software warranty services for which vsoe has not yet 
table of contents been established 
however  we may continue to offer new and incremental services to our customers in the future and will need to establish vsoe of fair value for those services 
this may result in shipments to those customers being recognized as ratable revenue until vsoe of fair value is achieved 
as of december   we had million of deferred revenue and million of deferred inventory costs on our balance sheet related to invoiced shipments of bundled products from periods prior to the second quarter of and the attainment of vsoe of fair value for most of our services 
now that vsoe of fair value has been established  we do not expect to continue to defer significant amounts of revenue and cost from invoiced shipments in future periods 
we expect revenue and gross profits in and future periods to more closely approximate the revenue and gross margin generated on the underlying invoiced shipments for those periods 
it remains difficult to predict future gross margins due to changes in product and customer mix and the timing of new customer deployments 
we will continue to make significant investments in the business  and management believes that operating expenses will average between and of revenue in the near term 
overview of consolidated financial data revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our products  support and services 
our revenue is comprised of three components product revenue  ratable product and related support and services revenue  or ratable revenue and services revenue 
product revenue primarily relates to bundled products that are sold only with services for which vsoe of fair value has already been established and therefore  is recognized upfront under the residual method in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transaction 
product revenue also includes products that are sold without services or a small amount of product sales where software is considered incidental and is recognized under staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab our dtn system is integrated with software that is more than incidental to the functionality of our equipment 
we refer to the integration of our dtn system with our software and related support and services as a bundled product 
we recognize the majority of our revenue pursuant to statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  or sop for arrangements with multiple elements which include product and services for which vsoe of fair value has been established  we allocate revenue to the undelivered element using the residual method based on vsoe of fair value for each of the undelivered elements 
however  when these transactions also include undelivered services for which vsoe has not been established  product revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the longest remaining service period 
services revenue is comprised of revenue related to services for which vsoe of fair value has been established  revenue related to services which were sold on a standalone basis or revenue related to extended hardware warranty sales 

table of contents the following table illustrates our revenue for the years ended december   december  and december  years ended december  december  december  in thousands revenue product ratable product and related support and services services total revenue product revenue 
product revenue consists of products that are sold without services or bundled products that are sold with services for which vsoe of fair value has already been established and therefore  is recognized upfront under the residual method in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transaction 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a sales agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe of fair value for software warranty  software subscription  training and installation and deployment services is determined by reference to the price the customer will be required to pay when these services are sold separately 
as discussed above  following the attainment of vsoe of fair value for software subscription services in the first quarter of and for training and installation and deployment services in the second quarter of  product revenue increased significantly due to the inclusion of product revenue from sales of bundled products and services where software subscription or training and installation and deployment services was the only undelivered element 
in  product revenue consisted primarily of a small number of sales of our networking products to customers who did not require support services and sales of an end of life product line that did not require significant customization and with regard to which software was considered incidental 
ratable revenue 
substantially all of our product sales are sold in combination with support services  which consist of software warranty or software subscription services 
in addition  we have sold training and installation and deployment services with a significant number of these bundled sales 
vsoe of fair value for support services  training and installation and deployment services is determined by reference to the price the customer is required to pay when these services are sold separately 
support services are comprised of software warranty and software subscription services 
software warranty provides customers with maintenance releases and patches during the warranty support period 
software subscription also includes maintenance releases and patches and in addition  provides customers with rights to receive unspecified software product upgrades released during the support period 
in order to establish vsoe for these services  we were required to establish a history of selling these services separately at a consistent price 
prior to december   we had not established vsoe of fair value for support services  training or installation and deployment services 
as a result  prior to that date  when all other revenue recognition criteria had been met and the only undelivered element was support services  training or installation and deployment services  revenue was deferred and recognized ratably over the longest undelivered service period 
the undelivered service period for these services ranged from one to five years and averaged months in the fourth quarter of this resulted in the majority of our invoiced shipments in being deferred and recognized over an average period of months 
revenue related to these arrangements is included in ratable product and related support and services revenue 

table of contents in the first quarter of  we established vsoe for software subscription services 
as a result  we are no longer required to ratably recognize product revenue for sales transactions where products were sold with software subscription 
product revenue from these transactions is recognized upon acceptance  and software subscription service revenue is deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement which is generally months 
in instances where acceptance of the product occurs upon formal written acceptance  revenue is deferred until such written acceptance has been received 
revenue allocated to product sales is included in product revenue  revenue allocated to services is included in services revenue 
however  when these transactions also included undelivered training or installation and deployment services prior to the second quarter of  product revenue was deferred and recognized ratably over the longest remaining support period until the training or installation and deployment services were complete 
upon completion of these services  the difference between the vsoe of fair value for the remaining software subscription period and the remaining unrecognized portion of the arrangement fee was recognized as ratable product and related support and services revenue 
the attainment of vsoe of fair value on software subscription services in the first quarter of resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of total revenue recognized from the underlying invoiced shipments 
product revenue increased due to our ability to recognize and allocate revenue related to bundled shipments where software subscription was the only undelivered element 
in addition  the weighted average revenue deferral period for current period shipments of bundled products and services was reduced to approximately days as compared to months in the fourth quarter of this change resulted in a significant increase in the amount of ratable revenue recognized from invoiced shipments in the first quarter of and a significant reduction in additions to deferred revenue and in the deferred revenue balance for the period 
we established vsoe for our training and installation and deployment services in the second quarter of this allowed us to recognize most of our shipments as revenue at the time of acceptance and to allocate that revenue to the appropriate revenue category in our consolidated statements of operations 
this resulted in increased levels of product and services revenue in the remainder of offset by a reduction in ratable revenue 
ratable revenue in future periods is expected to decline and relate primarily to a small portion of our shipments where products are sold in combination with software warranty and other services for which vsoe has not yet been established 
services revenue 
services revenue is comprised of revenue related to services for which vsoe of fair value has been established  revenue related to services which were sold on a standalone basis or revenue related to extended hardware warranty and other non bundled services 
following the attainment of vsoe of fair value for software subscription services in the first quarter of and attainment of vsoe of fair value for training and installation and deployment services in the second quarter of  we have recognized revenue from delivered training and installation and deployment services and software subscription revenues as services revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
total revenue 
the attainment of vsoe of fair value on most of our services significantly increased total revenues for this increase resulted from an increase in the recognition of revenue from invoiced shipments in the current period  combined with the recognition of million of deferred revenue from periods prior to the attainment of vsoe on most of our services 
we expect revenue in and future periods to more closely approximate the underlying invoiced shipments for those periods 

table of contents deferred revenue 
prior to december   a portion of our invoiced shipments of bundled products and services were recognized as revenue in such quarter and the remainder was recorded as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue increased each quarter by the amount of invoiced shipments of bundled products and services in that quarter and decreased by the amount of ratable revenue recognized from invoiced shipments of bundled products and services 
following the attainment of vsoe of fair value on software subscription in the first quarter of and attainment of vsoe of fair value for training and installation and deployment services in the second quarter of  an increased portion of our invoiced shipments are recognized as revenue in the same period in which they are invoiced 
as a result  our ratable deferred revenue balance has continued to decline throughout the additions to the product and ratable deferred revenue balances relate to invoiced shipments bundled with services for which we have not established vsoe of fair value or invoiced shipments for which basic revenue recognition has not been met 
our services deferred revenue balance relates to deferred software subscription and extended hardware warranty which will be recognized as service revenue on a ratable basis over the service delivery period and also relates to deferred training and deployment and installation services which will be recognized as services revenue upon delivery of services 
the following table illustrates the net increase decrease in deferred revenue for the specified periods year ended december  year ended december  pre mar

table of contents cost of revenue our cost of revenue is comprised of three components cost of product revenue  cost of ratable revenue and cost of services revenue 
the following table illustrates our cost of revenue for the specified periods years ended december  december  december  in thousands cost of revenue cost of product cost of ratable product and related support and services cost of services total cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue consists of the costs of manufacturing network components  such as personnel costs  stock based compensation  raw materials  overhead and period costs related to those sales recognized as product revenue in the period 
period costs consist primarily of shipping fees  logistics costs  manufacturing ramp up costs  expenses for inventory obsolescence  lower of cost or market adjustment  and warranty obligations  and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred or can be reasonably estimated 
cost of ratable revenue 
cost of ratable revenue consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing our network equipment  including personnel costs  stock based compensation  raw materials  overhead and period costs related to those sales recognized as ratable revenue as described above 
period costs associated with ratable revenue are recognized in the period in which they are incurred or can be reasonably estimated 
all other costs of ratable revenue are initially recorded as deferred inventory costs and are subsequently recognized in the same period as the corresponding revenue 
cost of services revenue 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of the costs of providing our service offerings  including personnel costs  stock based compensation and costs associated with third party service providers 
total cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing network components  such as personnel costs  raw materials  overhead and period costs and the costs of providing our service offerings to customers 
period costs consist primarily of shipping fees  logistics costs  manufacturing ramp up costs  expenses for inventory obsolescence  lower of cost or market adjustment  and warranty obligations  and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred or can be reasonably estimated 
included in cost of revenue for  and are inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventory of million  million and million  respectively 
we may experience some increase in inventory write downs in future periods as we complete a number of major product transitions 
in addition  we expect the cost of some of our products to increase in future periods due to changes in yields and production volumes for those products 
losses associated with products which are sold or anticipated to be sold at a loss are recognized in the period in which they are incurred or can be reasonably estimated 
the initial deployment of our dtn system at a customer involves the installation of common equipment  including a chassis  optical line amplifiers and related equipment 
this common equipment is typically sold at low or negative gross margins 
when we sell equipment at a loss  the losses are recognized in the period in which they 
table of contents are incurred or are reasonably estimatable 
we refer to this loss as a lower of cost or market adjustment  or lcm adjustment 
deferred inventory cost 
deferred inventory cost increases by the cost of invoiced shipments of bundled products and services in a period and decreases as cost of ratable revenue is amortized in that period 
the following table illustrates the net increase decrease in our deferred inventory cost for the specified periods year ended december  year ended december  pre mar 
 product ratable cost post mar 
 product ratable cost total total in thousands beginning balance additions to deferred inventory cost amortization to cost of revenue ending balance net increase decrease in deferred inventory cost balance represents changes in deferred inventory cost related to periods prior to the attainment of vsoe of fair value for most of our services 
represents changes in deferred inventory cost related to periods after the attainment of vsoe of fair value for most of our services 
gross margin gross margins have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the product mix  average selling prices of our products  new product introductions and enhancements  changes to our manufacturing costs  including the impact of fluctuations in yields and production volumes  the amount of revenue that is recognized up front versus ratably and the period over which that revenue is recognized ratably  and the amount of common equipment sold at a loss causing an lcm adjustment 
to satisfy our customers requirement of transmitting optical signals  our customers must purchase a combination of common equipment and some limited number of digital line modules dlms  tributary adapter modules tams  and tributary optical modules toms 
if a customer wishes to add capacity to our dtn system after their initial deployment to satisfy their additional demands  they may purchase additional dlms  tams and toms 
when a customer wishes to expand the reach of the dtn system or deploy another dtn system on a route  they may purchase a combination of additional common equipment and additional dlms  tams and toms 
pricing for optical communications systems  such as our dtn system  is very competitive and we must often respond to these competitive pressures by decreasing the initial purchase price of our product 
as a result of these competitive pressures and in order to gain new customers  our common equipment is typically sold at low margins or at a loss 
our dlms  tams or toms are typically sold at higher gross margins 
these higher margin sales positively impact overall gross margin 
due to the large impact of changes in product and customer mix and the timing of new customer deployments on expected margin levels  it remains difficult to predict future gross margins and quarter over quarter margin levels could be volatile 

table of contents the following table illustrates our gross margin for the specified periods years ended december  december  december  in thousands  except gross margin revenue cost of revenue gross profit loss gross margin the improved gross margin for compared to reflects the impact of the recognition of million of deferred gross profit related to invoiced shipments in periods prior to the attainment of vsoe of fair value for our services 
in addition  we recognized increased levels of revenue and gross profit from invoiced shipments 
this increase in the recognition of current year revenue and gross profit in was due to the attainment of vsoe of fair value for software subscription services and for our training and installation and deployment services 
gross margins on the underlying invoiced shipments also improved reflecting better customer and product mix and continued reductions in component pricing during the year 
in addition  we recorded a favorable change in estimate related to our warranty reserve of million in compared to an unfavorable impact in of million 
this positive change in estimate reflects continued improvements to product quality and lower expected return rates 
in addition  we experienced reduced costs of replacements due to increased use of lower cost repaired units and overall cost reductions in the repair process 
the prices paid for our dtn system vary by customer 
in addition  the quantity of dtn systems purchased by each of our customers varies from period to period depending on our customers needs for optical transport equipment 
to the extent that a customer with lower contractual prices purchases a significant proportion of the dtn systems sold within a given period  our gross margin for such period and for future periods in which that revenue is ratably recognized would be lower 
in addition  substituting or adding a new customer with a higher requirement for common equipment could result in increased inventory write downs in a given period or lower gross margins in that period 
as of december   deferred revenue related to bundled product sales from periods prior to the second quarter of and the attainment of vsoe of fair value for most of our services was million  and deferred inventory cost was million 
we do not expect to continue to defer significant amounts of margin from new invoiced shipments in the future 
we expect gross margins in and future periods to more closely approximate the margin generated on the underlying invoiced shipments for those periods 
operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  and are recognized as incurred 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase as we hire new employees to support our anticipated growth 
we expect that each of the categories of operating expenses discussed below will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in  but will decline as a percentage of total revenue in the long term 
research and development expenses are the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily include salary and related benefit costs  including stock based compensation expense  and facilities costs and other related expenses 
we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products 
we intend to continue to 
table of contents invest significantly in our research and development efforts both in the united states and internationally because we believe that they are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
we therefore expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include salary and related benefit costs  including stock based compensation expense  sales commissions  marketing and facilities costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel both in the united states and internationally to support our expected revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related benefit costs  including stock based compensation expense and facilities related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations  and fees for professional services 
professional services principally consist of outside legal  audit and information technology consulting costs 
other income expense  net during  other income expense  net includes interest income on our cash and short and long term investment balances  gains on sale of assets  losses or gains on investments  gross unrealized losses on our adjustable rate securities ars investment holdings offset by the gain on the associated put rights  and losses or gains on conversion of foreign currency transactions 
during  other income expense  net  also included an adjustment to record our convertible preferred stock warrants at fair value as required by staff position  issuer s accounting under fasb statement no 
for freestanding warrants and other similar instruments on shares that are redeemable  or fsp and interest expense 
if interest rates continue to fluctuate due to current global market conditions  we will experience volatility in future interest income from our cash and short and long term investment balances  assuming consistent investment levels 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to the tax benefits arising from the release of certain valuation allowances on domestic tax attribute carryforwards which was partially offset by the impact of certain non deductible stock compensation charges under sfas r  federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
significant estimates and assumptions made by management include revenue recognition  valuation of financial instruments  accrued warranty  cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments  inventory valuation  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes and allowances for doubtful accounts 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 

table of contents revenue recognition our networking products are generally integrated with software that is more than incidental to the functionality of the equipment 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  which is when product title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized net of cash discounts 
substantially all of our product sales are sold in combination with support services comprised of either software warranty or software subscription services 
in addition  we periodically sell training and installation and deployment services with our product sales 
software warranty provides customers with maintenance releases and patches during the warranty support period 
software subscription also includes maintenance releases and patches and in addition  provides customers with rights to receive unspecified software product upgrades released during the support period 
training services include the right to a specified number of training classes over the term of the arrangement 
installation and deployment services may include customer site assessments  equipment installation and testing 
product revenue consists of products that are sold without services or bundled products that are sold with services for which vsoe of fair value has already been established and therefore  is recognized upfront under the residual method in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transaction 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a sales agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe of fair value for software warranty  software subscription  training and installation and deployment services is determined by reference to the price the customer will be required to pay when these services are sold separately 
prior to the first quarter of  we had not established vsoe of fair value for its support services  and therefore recognized all revenue for transactions bundled with these services ratably over the longest support period which ranges from one to five years 
revenue related to these arrangements is included in ratable product and related support and services revenue 
we determined that we had established vsoe of fair value for software subscription in the first quarter and for training and installation and deployment services in the second quarter of for arrangements with multiple elements which include product and software subscription services and or training and installation and deployment services  we allocate revenue to the undelivered elements using the residual method based on vsoe of fair value for each such element and the remainder is recognized as product revenue 
however  when these transactions also include undelivered services for which vsoe of fair value has not been established  revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the longest remaining support period 
upon completion of the services for which vsoe of fair value has not been established  the difference between the vsoe of fair value for the remaining software subscription period and the remaining related service periods and the unrecognized portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as ratable product and related support and services revenue 
services revenue includes software subscription services  training  installation and deployment services and extended hardware warranty services 
revenue from software subscription and extended hardware warranty contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period  which is generally one year 
a majority of our customers have exercised the option to purchase software subscription services on an ongoing basis 
revenue related to training and installation and deployment services is recognized as the services are completed 

table of contents contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
in addition  shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery and transfer of title 
revenue is recognized only when title and risk of loss pass to customers 
in instances where acceptance of the product occurs upon formal written acceptance  revenue is deferred until such written acceptance has been received 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days from invoice 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and  therefore  revenue is not recognized until the fees become fixed or determinable which we believe is when they are legally due and payable 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based primarily on the creditworthiness and past payment history of the customer 
for sales to resellers  the same revenue recognition criteria apply 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a reseller 
we do not offer rights of return or price protection to our resellers 
revenue for products that do not require significant customization  and with respect to which any software is considered incidental  is recognized under staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue related to these arrangements is included in product revenue 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and in ratable product and related support and services revenue 
stock based compensation under statement of accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  sfas r  we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted and rights to acquire stock using the black scholes option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
for new hire grants  options typically vest with respect to of the shares one year after the option s vesting commencement date and the remainder ratably on a monthly basis over three years  commencing one year after the vesting commencement date 
for annual refresh grants  options typically vest ratably on a monthly basis over four or five years after the vesting commencement date 
we make a number of estimates and assumptions related to sfas r including forfeiture rate  expected life and volatility 
we utilized our historical data as an estimate of the expected forfeiture rate and we recognized compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  which incorporates the contractual terms  grant vesting schedules and terms and expected employee and director behaviors 
commencing in june  we elected to use the simplified method to estimate the expected term as permitted by sec staff accounting bulletin sab due to the unknown effect on option holder behavior of the increased liquidity of the underlying options following our ipo 
in december  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab amends sab to allow for the continued use  under certain circumstances  of the simplified method in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla stock options accounted for under sfas r 
as a result  we will continue to use the simplified method until we have sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 

table of contents expected volatility of the stock is based on our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we don t have sufficient historical volatility data for our own common stock 
in the future  as infinera gains historical data for volatility in our own stock and more data on the actual term employees hold their options  the expected volatility and expected term may change  which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and ultimately the expense we record 
inventory valuation inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost first in  first out method or market 
market value is based upon an estimated selling price reduced by the estimated cost of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimated average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract price  future demand and pricing for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand or is anticipated to be sold at a loss is written down to its estimated net realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we are not able to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to write off inventory  which would negatively impact our gross margin 
our inventory reserve for excess and obsolete inventory at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
our inventory reserve for lower of cost or market adjustment at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
in valuing our deferred inventory costs  we considered the valuation of inventory using the guidance of accounting research bulletin restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins arb 
in particular  we considered arb  chapter  statement and whether the utility of the products delivered or expected to be delivered at less than cost  primarily comprised of common equipment  had declined 
we concluded that  in the instances where the utility of the products delivered or expected to be delivered were less than cost  it was appropriate to value the deferred inventory costs and inventory costs at cost or market  whichever is lower  thereby recognizing the cost of the reduction in utility in the period in which the reduction occurred or can be reasonably estimated 
we have  therefore  recorded inventory write downs as necessary in each period in order to reflect common equipment inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in addition  we considered the guidance provided in arb  chapter  statement relating to losses on firm purchase commitments related to inventory items 
in instances where the expected selling price of common equipment in the future is below cost  we have recorded losses on these firm purchase commitments in the period in which the commitment is made 
when the inventory parts related to these firm purchase commitments are received  that inventory is recorded at the purchase price less the accrual for the loss on the purchase commitment 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts management makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
at december   we 
table of contents recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of million associated with accounts receivable deemed uncollectible relating to one customer 
at december   management did not reserve any of our accounts receivable as they were deemed fully collectible 
accrued warranty we warrant that our products will operate substantially in conformity with product specifications 
upon delivery of our products  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products or the related components that may be returned under warranty 
our hardware warranty periods range from to years from date of acceptance for hardware and days to months for software warranty 
the hardware warranty reserve is based on actual historical returns experience and the application of those historical returns rates to our in warranty installed base 
we periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments we consider all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of days or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts which  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts 
we consider all debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than days and remaining time to maturity of one year or less to be short term investments 
we classify debt instruments with remaining maturities greater than one year as long term investments

in accordance with sfas no 
 it is our policy to review our available for sale marketable debt securities classified as short or long term investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not any security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of such security 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists in one of our marketable debt securities  our policy is to write down these debt investments to the market value and record the related write down as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
no other than temporary impairment charges related to available for sale investments were recorded in  or 
table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized within the applicable future periods 
we must assess the likelihood that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions  and to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet the more likely than not standard  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december  and december   certain of our deferred tax assets were fully reserved with a valuation allowance because  based on the available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income  by jurisdiction  based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted

gross margins on the underlying invoiced shipments also improved reflecting better customer and product mix and continued reductions in component pricing during the year 
in addition  we recorded a favorable change in estimate related to our warranty reserve of million in compared to an unfavorable impact in of million 
this positive change in estimate reflects continued improvements to product quality and lower expected return rates combined with reduced costs of replacements due to increased use of repaired units and cost reductions in the repair process

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to the tax benefits arising from the release of certain valuation allowances on domestic tax attribute carryforwards which was partially offset by the impact of certain non deductible stock compensation charges under sfas r  federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and december  reflect unbenefited us losses  non deductible warrant interest expense and foreign taxes provided on foreign subsidiary earnings 
as of december   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets based upon our cumulative loss incurred since inception 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income for federal 
table of contents income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire beginning in if not utilized 
as of december   we also have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire beginning in  if not utilized 
the amount of net operating loss carryforwards noted above and related to excess stock option deductions is approximately million 
when the excess stock option deductions are used to offset future taxable income  these estimated tax benefits of approximately million will result in a credit to stockholders equity 
additionally  we have federal and california research and development tax credits available to reduce future income tax expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in the year if not utilized  while the california research credits have no expiration date 
utilization of these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to an annual limitation due to provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we experience an ownership change that may occur  for example  by a change in significant shareholder allocation or equity structure 
since  we have analyzed potential changes in ownership and determined that changes in ownership have occurred that would limit tax attribute carryforwards 
however  based on the work performed  we believe the limitations are not significant enough to impact future utilization of tax attributes 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions to forecast federal  state and international operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
the assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with our income forecasts used to manage our business

the purchase price for these shares of series g convertible preferred stock was per share  with the exception of a board member s purchase of  shares in october at per share 
we also received million from employee stock options exercised during adjustable rate securities at december   we held million par value of investments comprised of ars  which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest rate being reset through auctions that are typically held every  or days 
these securities have historically traded at par and were callable at par at the option of the issuer 
interest was typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually 
at december   all of the ars we held were aaa rated  with most collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
since february  most of the auctions for these securities have failed and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the par value in the near term from our ars is limited and it could take until final maturity of the ars up to years to realize our investments par value 
in the event we need to access these funds  we may not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful  a secondary market develops or the securities are redeemed by the broker dealer 
in october  we elected to participate in a rights offering by ubs financial services  inc ubs  one of our brokers  which provides us with certain rights the put rights to sell ubs million par value of the ars  which we purchased through ubs back to ubs at par value  at any time during a two year sale period beginning june  by electing to participate in the rights offering  we granted ubs the right  exercisable at any time prior to june  or during the two year sale period  to purchase or cause the sale of our ars call right 
as such  we recorded a gain of million related to the put rights provided by the settlement and a gross unrealized loss of million related to the million par value portion of our ars portfolio as we may decide not to hold these securities until final maturity because of the opportunity provided by the put rights 
the ars and the put rights will be revalued to fair market value on a quarterly basis until the sale of these securities has been completed 

table of contents as of december   the remainder of our ars of approximately million at par value  had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately million to reflect their current lack of liquidity 
since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary  it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under stockholders equity as of december  these failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the ars but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities 
we believe that given their high credit quality  we will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities 
we do not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in our ars  even for an extended period of time  will affect our ability to finance our operations  including our continued investments in research and development and planned capital expenditures 
we continue to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments 
these investments are classified as non current assets until we have better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored 
liquidity in the next twelve months  capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of approximately million to million  primarily for product development and manufacturing expansion and upgrades 
we believe our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond months  we may require additional capital from equity or debt financings to fund our operations  respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities or otherwise 
we may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity  convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity  our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of us  and any new securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock

these securities have historically traded at par and were callable at par at the option of the issuer 
interest 
table of contents was typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually 
at december   all of the ars we held were aaa rated  with most collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
since february  most of the auctions for these securities have failed and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the par value in the near term from the ars is limited and it could take until final maturity of the ars up to years to realize the investments par value 
in the event we need to access these funds  we may not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful  a secondary market develops or the securities are redeemed by the broker dealer 
in october  we elected to participate in a rights offering by ubs  one of our brokers  which provides us with put rights to sell ubs million par value of the ars  which we purchased through ubs back to ubs at par value  at any time during a two year sale period beginning june  by electing to participate in the rights offering  we granted ubs the right  exercisable at any time prior to june  or during the two year sale period  to purchase or cause the sale of our ars 
ubs has agreed to pay us the par value of our ars within one day of settlement of any call right transaction 
we elected to adopt sfas on the put rights and elected to treat this portion of our ars portfolio as trading securities 
as such  we recorded a gain of million related to the put rights provided by the settlement and a gross unrealized loss of million on the million par value portion of our ars portfolio as we may decide not to hold these securities until final maturity because of the opportunity provided by the put rights 
the put option and the adjustable rate securities will be revalued to fair market value on a quarterly basis until the sale of these securities has been completed 
the fair value of our investment in these securities could change significantly in the future  based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the financial markets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding investments and fair value measurements 
in addition  we recorded an unrealized loss of million under accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under stockholders equity as of december  related to the remaining million of our ars which are not subject to the ubs settlement
