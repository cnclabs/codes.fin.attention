item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those matters discussed under the heading forward looking statements  above 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits ics 
our manufacturing equipment is used for transistor level  or front end of line manufacturing  and also in specialized applications for processing the interconnect layer  or back end of line processing 
our manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capabilities and high productivity for the fabrication of current and next generation ics 
our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
because the demand for semiconductor devices is highly cyclical  the demand for wafer processing equipment is also highly cyclical 
during  there was a significant weakness in the semiconductor equipment market  which was exacerbated by the global economic slowdown  and weakness in the credit markets  followed by a global recession 
consequently  revenues decreased by percent to million from million in gross profit decreased year over year by million or percent  primarily due to lower revenue  factory under absorption at these low revenue levels and higher provisions for inventory write downs 
despite this trend  we invested in our future by increasing our research  development and engineering activity expenses in to expand our product offerings in dielectric etch  rtp and dry strip products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were also higher by million or percent as a result of significantly higher receivable reserves and additional provisions for evaluation tools at customer sites 
other significant items in included restructuring charges of million  goodwill impairment of million and impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets of million 
net loss before tax was million  or percent of net sales in  compared to net income before taxes of million  or percent of net sales in we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and no long term debt at december  with our current cash position  we believe we have sufficient resources to meet our requirements for the next year 
in  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of shares of common stock through open market purchases or private transactions 
in and  million and million shares  respectively were repurchased under this program for a total of million 
beginning in the second half of and throughout  we experienced weakness in the overall semiconductor market combined with the global financial crisis  and we expect that weakness to continue into and perhaps into oversupply conditions in the semiconductor market have significantly reduced the utilization at our customer s fabrication plants and delayed capital investments to subsequent quarters 
we are uncertain as to when revenues will increase to breakeven levels 
there continue to be several uncertainties that will impact gross profit margin during at these low revenue levels  we will continue to have significant under absorption of our factories and may have to take additional inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
these factors will have a major impact on our gross margin percentages for during  we will respond to these challenges with significant cost reduction measures  while continuing to invest in our core and new products to position us for success in the semiconductor equipment market 
we continue to focus on our objectives to outsource manufacturing in fremont and germany to reduce manufacturing overhead costs 
our global headcount has been reduced by approximately percent as a result of various restructuring activities during we have optimized our worldwide facilities  reduced variable headcount expenses through shutdowns  unpaid time off  and are taking several measures to reduce travel  outside service and facility related costs 
we will continue to review our operations and take further cost reduction measures as necessary  in order to minimize the cash used in operations  and retain sufficient cash reserves for the next twelve months 
however  though we have implemented these cost cutting and operational flexibility measures  we are largely dependent upon increases in sales in order to improve our profitability 
going forward  the success of our business will be dependent on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for semiconductors and semiconductor wafer processing equipment  and our ability to a significantly grow the company  either organically or through acquisitions  in order to enhance our competitiveness and profitability  b develop and bring to market new products that address our customers needs  c grow customer loyalty through collaboration with and support of our customers  d maintain a cost structure that will enable us to operate effectively and profitably throughout changing industry cycles and e generate the gross profits necessary to enable us to make the necessary investments in our business 
results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease net sales    cost of sales  gross profit  operating expenses research  development and engineering  selling  general and administrative   amortization of intangibles restructuring charges   n a impairment of goodwill   n a impairment of intangibles and long lived assets  n a total operating expenses  income loss from operations    n a interest income    interest expense n a other income expense  net  n a income loss before income taxes    n a provision for income taxes  net income loss  n a sales net sales decreased by percent to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to a million decline in systems sales  a million decline in spares and service sales and a million decline in royalty revenue arising from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit with dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd dns 
no further royalty payments are expected to be received from dns 
we believe that a substantial portion of the decrease in net sales is a result of the current global economic downturn  which has negatively impacted demand for our products 
at the beginning of the downturn  the weakness was limited to the memory market  but recently  the weakness has extended to the other segments of the wafer fabrication equipment market  compounded by the global economic crisis 
approximately percent of our systems sales are from the memory market 
international sales  to customers based in europe and asia  including china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan  accounted for percent of net sales in  compared to percent for the same period in we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
deferred revenue at december  decreased to million from million at december   primarily due to a million net decrease in deferred revenue for system shipments and a million net increase in deferred revenue for service contracts 
gross profit and gross profit margin 
gross profit was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or percent compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a percent decline in net sales in when compared to  manufacturing under absorption of million in compared to million in  and million in inventory reserves and manufacturing direct costs in compared to million in the weakness in the overall semiconductor equipment market resulted in lower revenue levels and the corresponding under absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs in our factories 
we have taken additional inventory reserves for excess inventory due to lower forecasted revenue volumes 
we have reduced manufacturing headcount by approximately percent as a result of our restructuring activities announced in the third and fourth quarters 
this has resulted in a reduction in manufacturing overhead costs  but the significant revenue decline has still resulted in under absorption of costs 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  decreased to percent from percent for the year ended december   a decline of percent 
the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production levels and additional inventory reserves 
due to intense competition  we continue to face pricing pressures that can affect our gross profit margin 
our gross profit margin has varied over the years and will continue to be affected by many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  economies of scale  material and other costs  overhead absorption levels and the timing of revenue recognition in accordance with accounting rules 
research  development and engineering rd e 
rd e expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million in higher depreciation on lab tools  lower research and development credits from a research partner of million  million higher outside service expenses  and million of other costs  partially offset by lower material expenses of million as our millisecond anneal product transitioned into later stages of product development 
selling  general and administrative sg a 
sg a expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to million higher receivables provisions  additional amortization of million for evaluation tools at customer sites  a million one time material credit related to reserve releases in against a government funded project  million higher installation expenses related to the evaluation tools at customer sites and million higher expenses arising from market development and selling efforts 
these increases were partially offset by million in reduced payroll expenses arising from restructuring activities  million savings from contract re negotiations and reduced third party services  and million in lower sales commissions and insurance costs 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expenses of million for the years ended december  and  respectively represents amortization of purchased technology acquired as a result of the vortek acquisition in at the end of  we recorded an impairment charge to write down the entire value of purchased technology  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
restructuring expenses 
during  we implemented several restructuring programs in response to the weakness in the overall semiconductor industry 
as part of the fourth quarter restructuring activity  we implemented a reorganization of our structure to reduce costs of operations and streamline the organization going forward 
we reduced about positions or percent of the global work force through reductions in force and outsourcing 
we incurred restructuring charges including benefits of million in severance expenses and have paid out million against this reserve 
we expect to incur another million for severance expenses and complete all activities related to this plan by the second quarter of as part of the third quarter restructuring activity  we implemented a cost alignment plan to reduce headcount and optimize facilities worldwide 
we reduced positions or percent of the global work force 
manufacturing positions represented approximately fifty percent of the positions impacted 
we optimized our facilities worldwide and as a result  intend to reduce our leased space in germany 
we incurred restructuring charges of million for severance costs and million for lease termination expenses and have paid out million against this reserve 
we have made an adjustment to the reserve of million 
we expect to incur another million for possible lease termination expenses and complete all activities related to this plan by the second quarter of as part of the second quarter restructuring activity announced in june  we eliminated approximately positions  or about percent of the global workforce primarily in the office support organizations 
we incurred restructuring charges of million for severance expenses and have paid million against this reserve 
we have made adjustments to the reserve of million 
all activities against this plan have been completed 
in summary  as a result of our restructuring activities in  we have reduced our headcount by approximately percent or employees  and optimized facilities worldwide 
the estimated annual savings from all the restructuring activities are expected to be approximately million 
a percentage of the savings will be re invested in our new product development activities and the remainder will help us reduce our cash loss from operations 
during  restructuring charges were million primarily representing severance expenses and million was paid against this restructuring reserve 
we expect to incur future charges of million for lease termination expenses and million in additional severance expenses against these restructuring programs and expect to complete all activities against these plans by the second quarter of there were no restructuring charges for the year ended december  impairment of goodwill 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of goodwill  as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the write off represented the entire net book value of goodwill 
there was no impairment charge related to goodwill for the year ended december  see note to the accompanying financial statements for further detail on goodwill impairment 
impairment of intangibles and long lived assets 
in  we recorded impairment charges to write off the net book value of all of our intangible assets of million and certain lab assets of million  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the write off of the intangible assets represented the entire net book value of certain technology acquired from vortek in october of there were no impairment charges related to intangibles and long lived assets for the year ended december  see note to the accompanying financial statements for further detail on impairment of intangibles and note for further detail on impairment of long lived assets 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income of million decreased in by million compared with due to lower cash investment balances in and lower average interest rate yields of percent compared to percent in the million increase in other expense  net in compared with was primarily due to million foreign exchange losses caused by a weakening dollar in the first half of and one time payments of million received in connection with the termination of two commercial agreements in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in consisted entirely of a million provision for foreign taxes 
the provision for income taxes in consisted primarily of a million provision for federal and state income taxes and a million provision for foreign taxes 
currently  we have provided a full valuation allowance for all jurisdictions except germany as we have determined that  due to uncertainties and other considerations related to our current operations and our expectations of future operations  it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets generated from net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized 
our provision for income taxes could be favorably impacted during if our results of operations and forecasts for future profitability improve sufficiently to indicate that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
such a change in management s expectations could result in a future material change to our valuation allowance assessment and the resulting future income tax provision 
years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed in both amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease net sales    cost of sales  gross profit  operating expenses research  development and engineering  selling  general and administrative   amortization of intangibles gain on disposition of wet business impairment of intangibles total operating expenses  income from operations    interest income    interest expense other income expense  net  income before income taxes   provision benefit for income taxes  net income  sales 
the decrease in net sales in compared with was primarily due to an million decrease in system sales  or percent  and a million decrease in service and spare parts sales  or percent 
our net sales for also included million of royalty revenue from dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd 
dns  compared with million for the sales decline in reflected the overall decline in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
in  we received business from leading semiconductor manufacturers in all regions we serve china  europe  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and the united states 
international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and asia  including china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan  accounted for percent of net sales in  compared to percent for we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
gross profit and gross profit margin 
the increase in gross profit for compared with was primarily due to net recognition of million in previously deferred systems revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
our gross profit for included million of royalty revenue received from dns  compared with million for the royalty revenue carries no associated cost of sales 
gross profit margin increased by percentage points in compared to  percentage points of which was due to net recognition of previously deferred systems revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  percentage point of which was due to higher gross profit margin related to systems sales  percentage points of which was due to dns royalties and percentage point of which was due to higher gross profit margin from service and spare parts sales 
research  development and engineering 
the increase in rd e expenses in compared with was primarily due to increased activity in to expand our portfolio of products capable of addressing stringent sub nm requirements 
selling  general and administrative 
the increase in sg a expenses in compared with was primarily the result of a million increase in employee compensation and a million increase in stock based compensation as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  which were partially offset by a million decrease related to the release of amounts previously accrued upon completing all remaining obligations under a foreign government funded capital development project  a million decrease of accounts receivable that were collected during the period and were previously reserved  and a million decrease in outside services 
as a percentage of net sales  our sg a expenses increased in compared to because of the increased sg a spending in and a decrease in net sales in amortization of intangibles 
amortization expenses in and were due to our acquisition of vortek in october gain on disposition of wet business 
in  we concluded all activities related to the disposition of the wet business  and released an over accrual of million upon completion of our obligations under the sale of the wet business 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income increased in compared with due to higher cash investment balances in interest expense for and was minimal 
the million increase in other income  net in compared with was primarily due to a million increase due to foreign currency translation and a million increase in net gains on forward foreign exchange contracts settled in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million provision for federal and state income taxes and a million provision for foreign taxes 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million provision for federal and state income taxes  a million provision for taxes in germany and a provision of million for other foreign taxes 
stock based compensation during the years ended december   and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation related to stock options 
as of december   there was million of unrecorded deferred stock based compensation  after estimated forfeitures  related to stock options  which will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation related to our employee stock purchase plan and million  million and million  respectively  of compensation cost related to restricted stock units 
compensation cost for a restricted stock unit is determined based on the grant date fair value of the shares of common stock  and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
as of december   there was million of unrecorded deferred stock based compensation  after estimated forfeitures  related to non vested restricted stock units granted under the equity incentive plan 
we expect to recognize that cost over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  stockholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december  working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  credit arrangements in june  we renewed our million revolving line of credit with a bank 
the revolving line of credit now expires in june and has a facility fee of  as of december   we had no borrowing under this credit line 
all borrowings under this credit line bear interest at a per annum rate equal to either the bank s prime rate minus basis points or the london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points  at our option 
the line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets excluding intellectual property 
as of december  we were not in compliance with one of the covenants under this line of credit relating to tangible net worth 
the covenants were modified in february and the new terms of the line of credit require us to satisfy certain quarterly financial covenants  including sec reporting compliance  maintaining minimum financial ratios related to current assets and current liabilities and maintaining a minimum cash balance of million 
the cash balances may be withdrawn  but the availability of short term lines of credit is dependent upon maintenance of such cash balances 
as of this filing  we were in compliance with all covenants 
contractual obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
our contractual commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table operating vendor commitments sublease lease payments subcontractor inventory other total income thousands thereafter  other vendor commitments primarily include service related contracts and agreements for information technology support  commitments for non inventory purchases of assets  and other service related commitments 
our deferred income taxes have been excluded from the table above because the related future cash outflows are uncertain 
as discussed in note  on january  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
at december   we had approximately million of gross unrecognized tax benefits that may be subject to examination by applicable tax authorities 
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december  is million related to tax positions and estimated interest and penalties for which it is reasonably possible that the statute of limitations will expire in various foreign jurisdictions within the next twelve months 
in connection with the acquisition of vortek industries  ltd vortek in  we became party to an agreement between vortek and the canadian minister of industry the minister relating to an investment in vortek by technology partnerships canada 
under that agreement  as amended  mattson technology  inc or vortek renamed mattson technology  canada  inc or mtc agreed to various covenants  including a payment by us of a royalty to the minister of percent of revenues from flash rtp products  up to a total of cad  approximately million at december   b mtc maintaining a specified average workforce of employees in canada through october   c investment of a certain amount by october  and certain other covenants concerning protection of intellectual property rights and manufacturing obligations 
if we  or mtc  do not materially satisfy our covenants  the minister may demand payment of liquidated damages in the amount of cad  less any royalties paid by mtc or us to the minister 
we have been providing annual reports to the canadian government on the status of the entity and believe we are materially in compliance with these covenants 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
legal settlement on march   a jury in san jose  california rendered a verdict in favor of our subsidiary  mattson wet products  inc formally cfm technologies  inc  in a patent infringement suit against dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd 
dns  a japanese manufacturer of semiconductor wafer processing equipment 
on june   we entered into a settlement agreement and a license agreement with dns  under which dns agreed to make payments totaling between million minimum and million maximum  relating to past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney fees and costs and license fees 
as of december   dns has made payments aggregating million under the terms of the settlement and license agreements 
the agreement has expired and no further payments are anticipated 
in may  dns paid us the final royalty payment under the license agreement of million for royalties due through january  we recognized million  million and million of royalty revenue from dns for the years ended december   and  respectively  which is recognized as net sales in the consolidated income statements 
liquidity and capital resources outlook as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we believe that these balances will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months 
we will continue to review our expected cash requirements  and plan to take appropriate cost reduction measures to ensure that we have at least six to eight quarters of available cash 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operations of million in was primarily due to a net loss of million  non cash charges of million and a million decline in assets and liabilities 
the decline in net assets of million represented a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a million increase in inventories  a million decrease in deferred revenue  and a million decrease in other liabilities  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable and advanced billings  a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and a million decrease in other assets 
non cash charges of million  represented million in impairments of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets  million in depreciation and amortization charges  million in inventory valuation charges  million in stock based compensation  and million in allowance for doubtful accounts 
the increase in inventory was primarily for new product inventory  evaluation inventory shipped to customers  inventory transfers to property  plant and equipment and increases in spares inventory for customer satisfaction purposes 
approximately percent of our inventory balances relate to evaluation tools already placed in the field in customer fabrication plants 
spares inventory represents percent of our inventory balances 
a portion of the increase in inventory consists of million in inventory transfers to property  plant and equipment at our research and development facilities 
the decrease in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and accounts receivable is indicative of our declining revenue volumes 
the decrease in prepaid expenses of million was primarily due to decreases in our prepaid value added tax balances as we received tax refunds 
net cash provided by operations of million in was primarily due to net income of million  a million decrease in accounts receivable and advanced billings  a million increase in other liabilities  a million decrease in inventories delivered systems  million in depreciation and million in stock based compensation  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a million increase in inventories  a million decrease in deferred revenue and a million reduction in allowance for doubtful accounts 
net cash provided by operations of million in was primarily due to net income of million  depreciation and amortization charges of million  non cash charges of million for impairment of intangibles and million for stock based compensation  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and inventory valuation charges of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to record sales in the fourth quarter of and an increase in inventories of million 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our net sales and operating results  amount of revenue deferred  inventory purchases  collection of accounts receivable and timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily due to purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital spending of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million 
our capital spending in was primarily due to additions of laboratory tools and equipment used in our rd e activities 
net cash provided by investing activities of million in was primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million and proceeds from sales of property and equipment of million  partially offset by purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital spending of million 
our capital spending in was primarily due to additions of technology used in our rd e activities 
net cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily due to purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital spending of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million 
our capital spending in was primarily due to additions of technology used in our rd e activities 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities in was million  which was due to repurchases of our stock of million  partially offset by net proceeds from stock plans of million 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  which was primarily attributable to repurchases of our stock of million  partially offset by net proceeds of million from stock plans 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted of million in proceeds from stock plans 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring  income taxes and stock based compensation as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we account for equipment sales as follows for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for all sales of new products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  for equipment sales to existing customers who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance provisions  or equipment sales to new customers purchasing existing products with established reliability  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which we bifurcate a sale transaction into two separate elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
the two elements are the tool and installation of the tool 
under this approach  the portion of the invoice price that is due upon shipment  generally percent of the total invoice price  is recognized as revenue upon shipment and title transfer of the tool  percent of the costs of the tool are recognized at shipment and the remaining portion of the total invoice price  generally percent of the total invoice price  which is due once installation services have been accepted  is not recognized as revenue until final customer acceptance of the tool 
from time to time  however  we allow customers to evaluate systems  and since customers can return such systems at any time with limited or no penalty  we do not recognize revenue until the customers accept these evaluation systems 
in and earlier periods  revenues associated with sales to customers in japan were recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurred upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales of rtp products through our distributor in japan  where we recognized revenues upon title transfer to the distributor 
in december  we expanded our distributor relationship in japan to cover all our products 
under the new distributor agreement  revenues are recognized upon title transfer  which occurs upon shipment to the distributor 
for spare parts  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
we recognize service and maintenance contract revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is established based on historical trends  current economic conditions  delinquency status based on contractual terms and an analysis of specific exposures 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or if a customer was unable to make any payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for bad debts increased from million in to million in  principally due a change in estimate related to the collectability of certain receivables caused by bankruptcy of customers and worsening financial credit situations of some of our other customers 
warranty 
the warranty we offer on system sales generally ranges from months to months  depending on the product 
in  we transitioned our warranty period to months for most systems sales  except where previous customer agreements stated otherwise 
in  we also changed the coverage provided by the warranty to exclude certain consumable maintenance items 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty  based on historical costs  is recorded as a cost of sale when the revenue is recognized for the sale of the equipment or parts 
our warranty obligations require us to repair or replace defective products or parts  generally at a customer s site  during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the actual system performance and or field expense profiles may differ from historical experience  and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly 
actual warranty reserves and settlements against reserves are highly dependent on our system volumes  and workforce availability and utilizations 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot be certain that we will continue to experience the same warranty costs that we have had in the past 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis  and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
under our general terms of sale  title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  in each reporting period 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
inventory valuation 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated excess and obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we recorded inventory valuation charges of million in  million in and million in inventory includes evaluation tools placed at customer sites as part of our marketing efforts 
we amortize the cost of evaluation tools placed at customer sites over a two to three year period and charge the costs to sg a expenses 
we recorded amortization charges on our evaluation tools of million in and million in fair value measurements of assets and liabilities 
we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements for all financial assets and financial liabilities and for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and enhances fair value measurement disclosure 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on the our financial statements  and the resulting fair values calculated under sfas no 
after adoption were not significantly different than the fair values that would have been calculated under previous guidance 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for further details on fair value measurements 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and we also review goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with business acquisitions 
the value assigned to goodwill and intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not to be impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for further detail on goodwill impairment 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for further detail on impairment of intangibles and note for further detail on impairment of long lived assets 
restructuring 
we record costs associated with employee terminations and other exit activity in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
under sfas no 
 we record employee termination benefits as an operating expense when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required 
if employees were required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits  the fair value of the liability measured on termination date would be recognized ratably over the future service period 
the costs of severance are determined by local statutory requirements and company policies 
for some entities  where salaries are paid during the notice period  a portion of the severance reserves would be based on estimates of the ability to find employment during the notice period  and we would determine the reserves in accordance with these estimates 
we recognize the present value of facility lease termination obligations  net of estimated sublease income and other exit costs  when we have future lease payments with no future economic benefit 
in future periods we will record accretion expense to increase the liability to an amount equal to the estimated future cash payments necessary to exit the leases 
this requires a significant amount of judgment and management estimation in order to determine the expected time frame it will take to secure a subtenant  the amount of sublease income to be received and the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the future cash flows 
should actual lease exit costs differ from estimates  we will adjust the restructuring charge  which would impact net income in the period any adjustment was recorded 
for more information on restructuring charges refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin became effective for us beginning in fin addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the impact of our reassessment of our tax positions in accordance with fin resulted in a cumulative effect of adoption of million  which was recorded as an increase in our accumulated deficit in the first quarter of for all tax jurisdictions with the exception of our german operations  we recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we expect it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset as of december  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income and losses  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which would change income in the period of adjustment 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
total share based compensation for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
for more information on stock based compensation costs for  and  refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options  restricted stock awards and rights to purchase shares under employee stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not significant to the calculation of fair value 
we use historical volatility based on past performance of our common stock to estimate expected volatility  as we believe historical volatility is an appropriate indicator of expected future volatility 
if we determine that another method to estimate expected volatility or expected life is more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for share based awards could change significantly 
higher volatility and expected lives result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards  which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments in   and was insignificant 
the expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates 
we granted performance based restricted stock units to certain executives  officers and senior level management during the first quarter of the fair value of the performance based restricted stock units with market conditions was determined using a monte carlo valuation methodology with the assumptions on the volatility of our common stock  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
the fair value of the performance related component of the performance shares was equivalent to the grant date fair value of our common stock 
these restricted stock units vest in four equal tranches upon the achievement of four sequentially increasing revenue performance targets 
vesting is also contingent upon certain operating profit margin and stock price thresholds being met 
we recognize the compensation cost if we determine that the performance targets are capable of being met 
during the first quarter  we determined that the performance targets are capable of being met  but with the change in market conditions in the fourth quarter  we determined that it was not probable that the performance targets would be met by the specified dates 
we have not recorded any stock based compensation expense for these performance based restricted stock units 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  business combinations 
this standard establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired in a business combination 
this standard also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for our acquisitions made after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant impact on our financial statements  however  the implementation of sfas no 
r may have a material impact on financial statements for businesses acquired by us post adoption

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and enhances fair value measurement disclosure 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial statements  and the resulting fair values calculated under sfas no 
after adoption were not significantly different than the fair values that would have been calculated under previous guidance

 earnings per share 
this pronouncement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact that fsp no 
eitf will have on our financial statements beginning in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  nor hedge for these interest rate exposures 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of december  an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would not have a material adverse affect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  because of the short term nature of our portfolio  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates could harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio in the future as securities mature 
by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments 
about percent of our short term investments at december   mature in less than one year 
foreign currency risk historically  much of our revenues and capital spending has been transacted in us dollars 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the reporting period  and revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period 
gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local currencies are the functional currency are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred 
because much of our revenues and capital spending are transacted in us dollars  and a significant percentage of our expenses are incurred in euros and canadian dollars  we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially adversely affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows  depending on the strength of the us dollar relative to the currencies of other countries in which we operate 
during the year there have been significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar when compared to euro and canadian dollar 
by the end of the year  the us dollar when compared to the euro had strengthened by about percent during the twelve months ended december   and had strengthened by about percent against the canadian dollar 
other expense  net for the twelve months ended december  included a realized foreign currency exchange loss of million  compared to gains of million for the same period in cumulative translation adjustments included in comprehensive income during were million primarily due to the fluctuations of the us dollar against other currencies during  which favorably impacted the net assets used in our foreign operations and held in local currencies  resulting in an increase in cumulative translation adjustments to million at december   compared to million at december  during and  we employed a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency fluctuations associated with japanese yen denominated firm purchase commitments and accounts receivable balances 
the goal of the hedging program was to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations associated with the sales of systems to japan and the revaluation gains losses of foreign denominated accounts receivable 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these forward contracts did not qualify as designated hedges 
all outstanding forward foreign currency contracts were marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains losses recorded in other income expense  net 
we did not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at december  and  we had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts 
at december   we had one outstanding forward foreign exchange contract for the purchase in total of million in exchange for billion japanese yen 
recording the fair value of this contract as of december  resulted in an unrealized gain of million  which was charged to the consolidated income statement in with respect to forward foreign currency exchange contracts  we recorded a net gain of million for  and a net gain of million in in other income expense  net 
there were no gains or losses arising out of foreign exchange contracts during the twelve months ended december
