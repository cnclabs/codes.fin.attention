of this total charge  million was recorded to cost of sales  which reduced the gross margin by points 
as part of this change in strategy  all future development of mass marketed mobile navigation products ceased with future efforts limited to unique mobile navigation products sold into niche markets with specialized and focused distribution 
when such products are launched  lower cost sourcing arrangements utilizing the ppl platform or that of other qualified vendors will be employed 
the million charge consisted of costs related to the impairment of certain intellectual property  the write down of certain mobile navigation inventory  related parts and other assets to estimated net realizable value  the disposition of future product returns by means other than returning them to vendors for credit against new products  and severance

outlook the company s business is subject to economic cycles and retail industry conditions both domestically and internationally 
purchases of discretionary items  such as the company s citizens band and two way radios  radar detectors and other consumer electronic products  tend to decline during recessionary periods  particularly those in which consumer spending is weak 
the economic environment in the us  canada and europe  where substantially all of the company s sales occur  has deteriorated over the past several months and consumer spending has been adversely impacted as store traffic has declined at the mass merchants  consumer electronics specialty stores  large department store chains  warehouse clubs and travel center chains that sell the company s products 
if the global macroeconomic environment continues to be weak or deteriorates further  there will likely be a negative effect on the company s revenues and earnings for both of its reporting segments for fiscal year and potentially continuing into fiscal year however  to help mitigate the negative effects of this weakening global macroeconomic environment  the company has taken certain steps  including reducing its workforce by more than ten percent and eliminating certain selling  general and administrative expenses amounting to more than million in annualized savings and placing on hold other expenses  which the company is prepared to trim or eliminate if necessary 
also  the company will focus on maximizing cash flows in its core cobra product lines  and  at the same time  launch key  new ppl products 
the company expects that these actions will enable it to be profitable in  with revenues at approximately the same levels as those in ebitda the company s ebitda showed substantial improvement in  as improved gross margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses offset substantially increased non cash charges

the company believes ebitda is a useful performance indicator and is frequently used by management  securities analysts and investors to judge operating performance between time periods and among other companies 
the company uses ebitda as defined to assess operating performance and ensure compliance with financial covenants 
ebitda and ebitda as defined are non gaap performance indicators that should be used in conjunction with gaap performance measurements such as net sales  operating profit and net income to evaluate the company s operating performance 
ebitda and ebitda as defined are not alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap

two way radio sales were also adversely affected by the declining emphasis on the category by retailers 
partially offsetting these declines were higher sales of power inverters  as a result of expanded distribution and increased promotional activity at travel centers  and two way radios in canada because of increased placement  which helped continue cobra s leading position in this market

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or a historical based estimation process that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the company as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
critical accounting policies generally consist of those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions 
the accounting policies and estimates that may have a significant impact upon the operating results  financial position and footnote disclosures of the company are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the time of shipment  except for revenue from sales of products to certain customers whose contractual terms specify fob destination 
revenue from sales of products to these customers is recognized at the estimated time of receipt by the customer when title and risk of loss would pass to the customer 
obligations for sales returns and allowances and product warranties are recognized at the time of sale on an accrual basis as described in the policies for sales returns reserve and warranty reserve 
in  the company adopted eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables for revenues associated with the ongoing access to its proprietary speed camera database that was bundled for sale with selected products and considered a single unit of accounting 
sales returns reserve 
the company has a policy that allows its customers to return product that was returned to them by their customers 
the reserve reflects the sales  cost of sales and gross profit impact of expected returns and related stock adjustments  as well as reduction in accounts receivable and increases in inventory for the amount of expected returns 
the amount of the reserve is determined by multiplying the sales and cost of sales by product category for the current quarter by historical return rates adjusted for any 
table of contents known changes in key variables affecting these return rates 
thus  judgments must be made regarding whether current return rates will approximate anticipated return rates 
this reserve will vary based on the changes in sales  gross margin and historical  as well as anticipated  return rates from quarter to quarter 
warranty reserve 
the company generally provides a one year consumer warranty for its products and also allows its customers to return product that has been returned by their customers 
consequently  the company maintains a warranty reserve  which reflects historical return rates by product category multiplied by the most recent six months of unit sales and the unit standard cost of each model 
the company uses the most recent six months of unit sales in its estimate  as historical experience indicates that most returns will occur within six months of the company s original sale date 
therefore  judgments must be made based on historical return rates and how the returned product will be disposed of  either by liquidation or return to vendors for credit on new purchases 
this reserve may vary based upon the level of sales and changes in historical return rates from quarter to quarter as well as estimated costs of disposal  either liquidation prices or the credit given by vendors 
liquidation reserve 
the company maintains a liquidation reserve representing the write down of returned product from our customers to its net realizable value 
returned inventory is either sold to various liquidators or returned to vendors for partial credit against similar  new models  this decision depends upon the estimated future demand for the models 
judgments are made as to whether various models are to be liquidated or returned to the vendor  taking into consideration the liquidation prices expected to be received and the amount of vendor credit 
the amount of the reserve is determined by comparing the cost of each unit returned to the estimated amount to be realized upon each unit s disposition  either from returning the unit to the vendor for credit towards the cost of new  similar product or liquidating the unit 
this reserve can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon quantities of returned inventory on hand and the estimated liquidation price or vendor credit per unit 
net realizable value reserve 
the company maintains a net realizable value reserve to write down below cost  as necessary  certain inventory not previously sold to customers where it is determined that net realizable value is less than cost 
thus  judgments must be made about which slow moving  excess or non current models are to be included in the reserve and the estimated net realizable value of such model ie  the per unit price that it is estimated can be received in the marketplace if the model was sold 
this reserve will vary depending upon the specific models selected  the estimated net realizable value for each model and quantities of each model that are determined will be sold below cost from quarter to quarter 
advertising and sales promotion accrual 
the advertising and sales promotion accrual reflects amounts provided to retailers and distributors for advertising and sales promotions 
customer programs  generally agreed to at the beginning of each year  are mainly variable programs dependent on sales and may be revised during the course of the year  based upon a customer s projected sales and other factors  such as new promotional opportunities 
accruals are made monthly for each customer by multiplying the customer s estimated program accrual percentage by the customer s actual sales 
therefore  this accrual will vary quarter to quarter depending on a given quarter s sales and the sales mix of customers 
in addition  should a customer significantly exceed or fall short of its planned program sales  negotiate changes to the term of the existing programs or add new ones  adjustments may need to be made to the customer s estimated program accrual percentage due to certain minimum and or maximum sales thresholds in such customer s programs 
periodic adjustments may also be necessary for unused customer funds 
deferred compensation 
obligations under the deferred compensation plans which are non qualified defined benefit plans and annual deferred compensation expense are determined by a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in the determination of obligations under the deferred compensation plans and annual deferred compensation expense include the discount rate and anticipated compensation for each individual covered by the plans  which in part is dependent upon the anticipated future profitability of the company 
the discount rate for and was percent 
the compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience and anticipated future performance 
the company maintains life insurance policies for certain current and former executives to provide funding for future obligations

such costs consist of expenditures incurred after technological feasibility of the software has been established either from a working model of the product developed  a detail design  or the purchase of computer software that has an alternative future use 
such costs which consist principally of coding and related costs are charged to earnings based on the ratio of actual product sales during the reporting period to expected product sales over the estimated product life cycle

if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
the fair values used in the sfas evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections and comparisons with comparable companies as well as the company s market capitalization

if the projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible assets  no impairment charge is recorded

r business combinations in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
r revised  business combinations sfas r to change how an entity accounts for the acquisition of a business 
when effective  sfas r will replace existing sfas in its entirety 
sfas r carries forward the existing requirements to account for all business combinations using the acquisition method formerly called the purchase method 
in general  sfas r will require acquisition date fair value measurement of identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests in the acquiree 
sfas r will eliminate the current cost based purchase method under sfas the new measurement requirements will result in the recognition of the full amount of acquisition date goodwill  which includes amounts attributable to non controlling interests 
the acquirer will recognize in income any gain or loss on the remeasurement to acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred or of previously acquired equity interests in the acquiree 
neither the direct costs incurred to effect a business combination nor the costs the acquirer expects to incur under a plan to restructure an acquired business will be included as part of the business combination accounting 
as a result  those costs will be charged to expense when incurred  except for debt or equity issuance costs  which will be accounted for in accordance with other generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas r will also change the accounting for contingent consideration  in process research and development  contingencies  and restructuring costs 
in addition  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination that occur after the measurement period will impact income taxes under sfas r 
sfas r amends the goodwill impairment test requirements in sfas for a goodwill impairment test as of a date after the effective date of sfas r  the value of the reporting unit and the amount of implied goodwill  calculated in the second step of the test  will be determined in accordance with the measurement and recognition guidance on accounting for business combinations under statement r 
this change could effect the determination of what amount  if any  should be recognized as an impairment loss for goodwill recorded before the effective date of statement r 
this accounting will be required when statement r becomes effective january  for the company and applies to goodwill related to acquisitions accounted for originally under sfas as well as those accounted for under sfas r 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited 
the company will adopt sfas r effective january  and apply its provisions prospectively

revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions 
the adoption of sfas  as it relates to financial assets  had no impact on the financial statements 
management is currently evaluating the potential impact of sfas  as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities  on the financial statements 
sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
this standard is now the single source in gaap for the definition of fair value  except for the fair value of leased property as defined in sfas sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas are described below level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg  interest rates  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
level inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable

non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements in december  the fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas an amendment of arb no 
sfas changes the accounting for  and the financial statement presentation of  non controlling equity interests in a consolidated subsidiary 
sfas replaces the existing minority interest provisions of accounting research bulletin arb  consolidated financial statements  by defining a new term non controlling interests to replace what were previously called minority interests 
the new standard establishes non controlling interests as a component of the equity of a consolidated entity 
the underlying principle of the new standard is that both the controlling interest and the non controlling interests are part of the equity of a single economic entity the consolidated reporting entity 
classifying non controlling

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange risks and interest rates are inherent to the company s operations 
changes to these factors could cause fluctuations in the company s net earnings  cash flows and the fair values of financial instruments subject to market risks 
the company identifies these risks and mitigates the financial impact with hedging and interest rate swaps 
debt incurred under a revolving loan agreement with a balance of million as of december  is priced at an interest rate that floats with the market 
therefore  this debt is not significantly affected by changes in the interest rate market 
a basis point movement in the floating debt rate would result in approximately a  increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows 
also  the company has million of debt as of december  with a rate of interest that is fixed as a result of an interest rate swap 
accordingly  fair value of this fixed rate debt can be significantly affected by changes in the interest rate market
