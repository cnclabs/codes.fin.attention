table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview plexus corp 
and its subsidiaries together plexus  the company  or we participate in the electronic manufacturing services ems industry 
we provide product realization services to original equipment manufacturers oems and other technology companies in the wireline networking  wireless infrastructure  medical  industrial commercial and defense security aerospace market sectors 
we provide advanced product design  manufacturing and testing services to our customers with a focus on the mid to lower volume  higher mix segment of the ems market 
our customers products typically require exceptional production and supply chain flexibility  necessitating an optimized demand pull based manufacturing and supply chain solution across an integrated global platform 
many of our customers products require complex configuration management and direct order fulfillment to their customers across the globe 
in such cases we provide global logistics management and after market service and repair 
our customers products may have stringent requirements for quality  reliability and regulatory compliance 
we offer our customers the ability to outsource all phases of product realization  including product specifications  development  design and design validation  regulatory compliance support  prototyping and new product introduction  manufacturing test equipment development  materials sourcing  procurement and supply chain management  product assembly manufacturing  configuration and test  order fulfillment  logistics and service repair 
plexus is passionate about its goal to be the best ems company in the world at providing services for customers that have mid to lower volume requirements and a higher mix of products 
we have tailored our engineering services  manufacturing operations  supply chain management  workforce  business intelligence systems  financial goals and metrics specifically to support these types of programs 
our flexible manufacturing facilities and processes are designed to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations as well as unique quality and regulatory requirements 
each of these customers is supported by a multi disciplinary customer team and one or more uniquely configured focus factories supported by a supply chain and logistics solution specifically designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness required to support that customer s fulfillment requirements 
our go to market strategy is also tailored to our target market sectors and business strategy 
we have business development and customer management teams that are dedicated to each of the five sectors we serve 
these teams are accountable for understanding the sector participants  technology  unique quality and regulatory requirements and longer term trends 
further  these teams help set our strategy for growth in their sectors with a particular focus on expanding the services and value add that we provide to our current customers while strategically targeting select new customers to add to our portfolio 
our financial model is aligned with our business strategy  with our primary focus to earn a return on invested capital roic in excess of our weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the smaller volumes  flexibility requirements and fulfillment needs of our customers typically result in greater investments in inventory than many of our competitors  particularly those that provide ems services for high volume  less complex products with less stringent requirements such as consumer electronics 
in addition  our cost structure relative to these peers includes higher investments in selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales to support our sector based go to market strategy  smaller program sizes  flexibility  and complex quality and regulatory compliance requirements 
by exercising discipline to generate a roic in excess of our wacc  our goal is to ensure that plexus creates a value proposition for our shareholders as well as our customers 
our customers include both industry leading original equipment manufacturers and technology companies that have never manufactured product internally 
as a result of our focus on serving market sectors that rely on advanced electronics technology  our business is influenced by technological trends such as the level and rate of development of telecommunications infrastructure and the expansion of networks and use of the internet 
in addition  the federal food and drug administration s approval of new medical devices  defense procurement practices and other government approval and regulatory processes can affect our business 
our business has also benefited from the trend to increased outsourcing by oems 
we provide most of our contract manufacturing services on a turnkey basis  which means that we procure some or all of the materials required for product assembly 
we provide some services on a consignment basis  which means that the customer supplies the necessary materials  and we provide the labor and other services required for product assembly 
turnkey services require material procurement and warehousing  in addition to manufacturing  and 
table of contents involve greater resource investments than consignment services 
other than certain test equipment and software used for internal manufacturing  we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products 
the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and risk factors included in item a herein 
executive summary as a consequence of the company s use of a weekly accounting system  periodically an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re align with a fiscal year end at the saturday closest to september in fiscal  this required an additional week  which was added to the first fiscal quarter 
therefore  the comparisons between fiscal and fiscal reflect that fiscal included days while fiscal included days 
fiscal net sales for fiscal decreased by million  or percent  from fiscal year to  million 
the challenging global economic environment contributed to flat revenues and decreased demand in all five of our end market sectors 
the overall reduction in net sales was driven primarily by decreased demand  resulting from economic conditions and lower end market demand for our customers products  in particular from customers in the industrial commercial  defense security aerospace and wireline networking sectors 
in addition  the inability of our customer to secure additional orders for the product we formerly manufactured for our unnamed defense customer led to decreased demand of million 
net sales in our wireline networking sector declined mainly due to decreased demand from several customers  including juniper networks  inc juniper  our largest customer 
the impact of overall economic conditions significantly contributed to reduced revenue  gross margin and roic below our normal expectations for the business 
as a result  we took action in the second fiscal quarter of to control costs  including reducing discretionary spending and workforce reductions  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we believe we took prudent steps to reduce our planned capital expenditures and working capital investments to balance potential future growth with current results 
we also identified other cost cutting measures that could be implemented quickly if forecasted revenues decline further or market conditions worsen 
gross margin was percent for fiscal  which compared unfavorably to percent for fiscal gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by the decline in net sales and unfavorable changes in customer mix  particularly related to our unnamed defense customer as well as reduced demand from juniper 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or percent  from the million for fiscal decreased variable incentive compensation of million as compared to fiscal  as well as reductions relating to cost cutting measures  contributed to the decline 
restructuring and asset impairment costs were million in fiscal  related to goodwill impairment in our europe reportable segment  the closure of our ayer facility and the reduction of our workforce across our united states facilities and in juarez 
net income for fiscal was million and diluted earnings per share were  which compared unfavorably to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal fiscal was favorably impacted by a percent effective tax rate benefit  a decrease from the percent effective tax rate in fiscal  due to a higher proportion of income in malaysia and xiamen  china  where we currently have reduced tax rates due to tax holidays which extend through and  respectively 
fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by million  or percent  over fiscal year to  million 
our sector focused business development strategy delivered growth in all five of our end market sectors 
net sales in the defense security aerospace sector exhibited the highest percentage growth due to new program wins  strong end market demand from the top three customers in this sector and strong demand from our largest defense customer in the first half of fiscal however  net sales to this customer decreased significantly in the second half of fiscal  from million in the first half of the year to million in the second half 
net sales in our wireline networking sector also increased due to increased demand from several customers  including juniper 
gross margin was percent for fiscal  which compared favorably to percent for fiscal gross margin in fiscal benefited from the operating leverage gained on increased revenues while moderating the 
table of contents increase in fixed manufacturing costs  favorable changes in the customer and sector mix and further operational efficiencies 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or percent  from the million for fiscal fiscal had increased variable incentive compensation of million over fiscal  as well as increased stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition  salaries and benefits increased  reflecting wage increases and additional headcount 
net income for fiscal was million and diluted earnings per share were  which compared favorably to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal fiscal was favorably impacted by an percent effective tax rate  a decrease from the percent effective tax rate in fiscal other 
the effective income tax rates benefits for fiscal  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the decreases in our effective tax rates were primarily due to a higher proportion of income in malaysia and xiamen  china  where we currently have reduced tax rates due to tax holidays that extend through and  respectively 
roic 
one of our metrics for measuring financial performance is after tax roic 
we define after tax roic as tax effected operating income  excluding unusual charges  divided by average capital employed over a rolling five quarter period 
capital employed is defined as equity plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
roic was percent  percent and percent for fiscal  and  respectively 
see the table below for our calculation of roic dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  september  september  operating income tax effected  excluding unusual charges average invested capital after tax roic roic is a non gaap financial measure which should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  measures of the company s financial performance prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
non gaap financial measures  including return on invested capital roic  are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance 
in particular  we provide roic because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions as well as management s performance under the tests which it sets for itself 
for a reconciliation of roic to our financial statements that were prepared using gaap  see exhibit to this annual report on form k  which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 
fiscal outlook 
our financial goals for fiscal are to capitalize on the ramp of new business wins and signs of improving customer demand to drive improvements in our operating income  which we believe will return our roic above our estimated wacc 
over the past several years  we have consistently set our target annual revenue growth range at percent to percent 
however  given the current macroeconomic environment and our uncertainty in longer range customer forecasts  we are refraining from providing fiscal full year revenue targets until forecasts begin to stabilize and visibility improves 
we currently expect net sales in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million to million  however  our results will ultimately depend upon the actual level of customer orders  which could vary 
assuming that net sales are in the range noted above  we would expect to earn  before any restructuring and asset impairment costs as well as our anticipated litigation recovery discussed in note in notes to consolidated financial statements  between to per diluted share in the first quarter 
we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be near zero percent due to the mix of pre tax income expected to occur in each tax jurisdiction 
due to significant tax rate differences in the jurisdictions in which we operate  our effective tax rate can change significantly as the relative amount of income earned in these jurisdictions changes 
china and mexico passed new tax laws that were effective on january  these new laws did not materially impact our tax rates in fiscal  but may result in a higher effective tax rate on our operations in future periods 
also  on november   mexico adopted tax reform legislation to take effect january   providing for a temporary increase in its income tax and value added tax rates from to and to  respectively  along with certain other changes 
while we are still analyzing the impact of this legislation  we do not currently believe it will have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods

reportable segments a further discussion of our fiscal and financial performance by reportable segment is presented below dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  september  september  net sales united states asia mexico europe elimination of inter segment sales operating income loss united states asia mexico europe corporate and other costs united states net sales for fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal to  million 
this decline reflected lower demand  mainly from our unnamed defense security aerospace customer  and the transfer of production for a wireline networking customer s product to our asia reportable segment as well as the decrease in the demand from this customer due to lower end market demand 
operating income for fiscal decreased million from fiscal primarily as a result of decreased sales and unfavorable changes in customer mix  particularly related to our unnamed defense customer 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to  million 
this growth reflected higher demand from an unnamed defense security aerospace customer  a wireless infrastructure customer and several wireline networking customers  including juniper 
operating income for fiscal improved million from fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales and favorable changes in customer mix  offset by bad debt expense of approximately million related to a customer that filed chapter bankruptcy during the year 
in addition  operating income in the prior year period was negatively impacted by a million write down of inventories 
asia net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to million 
this growth reflected increased net sales to several customers  with the most significant customer growth coming from the transfer of production of a wireline networking customer s product from the united states reportable segment to the asia reportable segment as well as increased demand from another customer in the wireline networking sector and a customer in the medical sector 
operating income improved million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher net sales and operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to million 
this growth reflected increased net sales to several customers  with the most significant customer growth coming from a customer in the medical sector  two customers in the wireline networking sector and a customer in the industrial commercial sector 
operating income improved million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal operating income improved primarily as a result of higher net sales and operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels 
increased operating income was partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs associated with the expansion of facilities and related production equipment  as well as additional selling and administrative costs incurred to support growth 

table of contents mexico net sales for fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal to million 
the net sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased demand from multiple customers across sectors due to lower end market demand  offset by increased demand from a new program in the industrial commercial sector

net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to million 
the net sales increase was primarily driven by increased demand from an industrial commercial customer as well as a new wireline networking customer  offset by decreased demand from two medical customers 
operating loss improved million from the prior year period to a loss of million 
the significant improvement from fiscal resulted from a concentrated effort to improve operating results and profitability 
this included the replacement of certain key members of the leadership team  headcount reductions to better align the cost structure to revenue and assistance from other plexus resources as needed 
in addition  fiscal results benefited from approximately million of revenue from shipping previously written down inventories and the ramping up of production for several new customers of the site 
europe net sales for fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal to million 
the change in net sales can be attributed to a decrease in exchange rates as well as decreased demand due to lower end market demand from one customer in the industrial commercial sector 
operating income decreased million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased net sales  start up costs associated with our oradea  romania facility and unfavorable changes in customer mix

for our significant customers  we generally manufacture products in more than one location 
net sales to juniper  our largest customer  occur in the united states and asia 
net sales to ge  another significant customer  occur in the united states  asia  mexico and europe 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for certain financial information regarding our reportable segments  including a detail of net sales by reportable segment 
facility closures expansions in fiscal  we announced the addition of a new facility in oradea  romania 
the leased facility will provide approximately  square feet of manufacturing space 
we began manufacturing in this facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal in early fiscal  we purchased a second manufacturing facility in appleton  wisconsin 
the new facility provided an additional  square feet of manufacturing space 
we began manufacturing in this facility in the second half of fiscal in april  we closed our ayer manufacturing facility and transitioned the customer programs to other facilities in our organization 
this decision was the result of our proactive strategic planning process which determined that the ayer facility was not strategically aligned with our future growth prospects and we could provide greater value to its customers by providing services at other plexus locations 
in fiscal  we leased approximately  square feet of manufacturing space in hangzhou  china 
we began manufacturing in the new facility during the first quarter of fiscal plexus currently has under construction a new corporate headquarters office facility in neenah  wisconsin  which will have approximately  square feet  occupancy is expected in the second half of fiscal the building will be owned by plexus and located on a parcel of real estate on which plexus has a ground lease with an option to purchase 
after plexus headquarters moves to the new facility  the current headquarters facility in neenah  which is shared with plexus engineering operations  will be used primarily for engineering

we remain dependent on continued net sales to our significant customers  and our customer concentration has remained at or above percent during the year 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end market demand and other factors 
any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts  or other customers  could materially affect our results of operations 
in addition  as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors  we become increasingly dependent upon economic and business conditions affecting that sector 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit and gross margin for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance october  september  increase september  september  increase decrease decrease gross profit gross margin for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors decreased net sales in three of our four reportable segments us  mexico and europe  particularly related to our largest customer  our unnamed defense customer and another significant customer as well as unfavorable changes in customer mix  which together accounted for approximately percent of the decrease in gross profit increased costs related to manufacturing in china  romania  mexico and the north american mechatronics facilities  which are not at full capacity  accounted for approximately percent of the decrease and a decrease in our variable incentive compensation expense  which offset the overall decrease in gross profit by approximately percent 
for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors increased net sales in all four us  asia  mexico and europe reportable segments as well as favorable changes in customer mix  including an increase in sales during the first half of fiscal to the large unnamed defense customer  which helped to improve operating efficiencies a moderate increase in fixed manufacturing costs in the us and asian reportable segments primarily due to higher salaries and benefits  as a result of additional employees to support net sales growth  and increased variable incentive compensation an increase in depreciation expense and other fixed manufacturing expenses as a result of our expanded facilities in penang being operational for an entire fiscal year and recognition of million of net sales in the europe and mexico reportable segments associated with shipments of previously written down inventories 
gross margin reflects a number of factors that can vary from period to period  including product and service mix  the level of new facility start up costs  inefficiencies resulting from the transition of new programs  product life cycles  sales volumes  price reductions  overall capacity utilization  labor costs and efficiencies  the management of inventories  component pricing and shortages  the mix of turnkey and consignment business  fluctuations and timing of customer orders  changing demand for our customers products and competition within the electronics industry 
additionally  turnkey manufacturing involves the risk of inventory management  and a change in component costs can directly impact average selling prices  gross margin and net sales 
although we focus on maintaining gross margin  there can be no assurance that gross margin will not decrease in future periods 
design work performed by us is not our proprietary property and all costs incurred with this work are generally considered reimbursable by our customers 
we do not track research and development costs that are not reimbursed by our customers and we consider these amounts immaterial

table of contents seventy percent of the dollar reduction in s a for fiscal was due to lower variable incentive compensation expense 
in addition  savings from various other cost cutting measures were partially offset by additional expenses related to expansions in china and romania 
s a as a percentage of net sales increased because these costs did not decline as quickly as net sales did in fiscal the dollar increase in s a for fiscal was due to increased salaries and benefits  reflecting wage increases  additional headcount to augment business development activities and additional expense for variable incentive compensation and stock based compensation expense 
variable incentive compensation expense increased million over the prior year period as a result of strong financial performance compared to incentive plan targets

fiscal restructuring and asset impairment costs for fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and asset impairment costs of million  related to goodwill impairment in our europe reportable segment  the closure of our ayer facility and the reduction of our workforce across our facilities in the united states and juarez 
the details of these fiscal restructuring actions are listed below 
goodwill impairment during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  writing off the entire carrying value of our goodwill related to our kelso facility 
the impairment charge was driven by macroeconomic conditions that contributed to an overall reduction in demand for the company s offerings from the kelso facility 
these conditions led to an interim triggering event  leading management to perform an interim goodwill impairment test 
this test resulted in the determination that the carrying value of the goodwill relating to kelso was fully impaired and therefore an impairment charge of million was recorded

income taxes 
income taxes for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  september  september  income tax expense benefit effective annual tax rate benefit the decrease in our effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to a higher proportion of income in malaysia and xiamen  china where we currently have reduced tax rates due to tax holidays that extend through and  respectively 
as a result of using the with and without method under the requirements for accounting for stock based compensation  we recorded a valuation allowance against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options until such time as the related deductions actually reduce income taxes payable

the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  which include a maximum total leverage ratio  maximum value of fixed rentals and operating lease obligations  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test  all as defined in the agreement 
as of october   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
if we incur an event of default  as defined in the credit facility including any failure to comply with a financial covenant  the group of banks has the right to terminate the credit facility and all other obligations  and demand immediate repayment of all outstanding sums principal and accrued interest 
interest on borrowing varies depending upon our then current total leverage ratio  as of october   the company could elect to pay interest at a defined base rate or the libor rate plus

origination fees and expenses associated with the credit facility totaled approximately million and have been deferred 
these origination fees and expenses will be amortized over the five year term of the credit facility 
quarterly principal repayments on the term loan of million each began june   and end on april   with a final balloon repayment of million 
the credit facility allows for the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchases of shares provided that no event of default including any failure to comply with a financial covenant is existing at the time of  or would be caused by  the dividend payment or the share repurchases 
as of october   we held million of auction rate securities  which were classified as long term investments and whose underlying assets were in guaranteed student loans backed by a u 
s 
government agency 
auction rate securities are adjustable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are reset every to days through an auction process  with underlying securities that have original contractual maturities greater than years 
auctions for these investments failed during fiscal and fiscal and there is no assurance that future auctions on these securities will succeed 
we do not intend to sell  nor will we be required to sell  these securities until a successful auction occurs and these securities are liquidated at par value 
at this time  we believe that the securities will eventually be recovered  although we cannot provide assurances 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not do so 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our adjustable rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
these developments have resulted in the classification of these securities as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements 
if the issuers of these adjustable rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit quality deteriorates  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments recorded value 
based on current expectations  we believe that our projected cash flows from operations  available cash and cash equivalents  the credit facility  and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months 
we currently do not anticipate having to use our credit facility to satisfy any of our capital needs 
if our future financing needs increase  we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing 
accordingly  we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources 
however  particularly due to the current instability of the credit and financial markets  we cannot be certain that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future 
however  the company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash  which in the future may include share repurchases  a special dividend or recurring dividends 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet obligations our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of october  dollars in millions payments due by fiscal year and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities on the balance sheet other long term liabilities not on the balance sheet total contractual cash obligations as of april   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement and immediately funded a term loan for million 
as of october   the outstanding balance was million 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of october   purchase obligations consisted of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business 
as of october   other long term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers as well as other key employees  and an asset retirement obligation 
we have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately million  as of october   related to unrecognized income tax benefits 
the company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation 
as of october   other long term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of a commitment for salary continuation in the event employment of one executive officer of the company is terminated without cause 
we did not have  and were not subject to  any lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations  other off balance sheet arrangements or other commercial commitments that were material 
disclosure about critical accounting policies our accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  there were no material changes to these policies 
our more critical accounting policies are noted below stock based compensation the financial accounting standard board fasb requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the service period generally the vesting period of the grant 
we used the modified prospective application  under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the first period that we adopted the fasb regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter 
prior periods stock based compensation expense is still presented on a pro forma basis 
we continue to use the black scholes valuation model to value stock options 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and 
table of contents cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings 
intangible assets during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  related to the company s sole goodwill asset 
the impairment wrote off the entire carrying value of our goodwill related to our kelso facility  which was the sole reporting unit in the europe reportable segment 
the impairment charge was driven by adverse macroeconomic conditions that contributed to an overall reduction in demand for the company s offerings from the kelso facility 
these conditions led to an interim triggering event  leading management to perform an interim goodwill impairment test 
this test resulted in the determination that the carrying value of the goodwill relating to kelso was fully impaired and therefore an impairment charge of million was taken 
should we have goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in the future  we would test those assets for impairment  at least annually  and recognize any related losses when incurred 
we would also measure the recoverability of goodwill under the annual impairment test by comparing a reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the reporting unit s estimated fair market value  which is primarily estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows  although market valuations may also be employed 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill would be considered impaired and a second test performed to measure the amount of impairment 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant customer or customers and unforeseen reductions in customer demand  future operating performance or industry demand 
revenue net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped  the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
this point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from plexus 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  if such requirements or obligations exist  then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled 
net sales from engineering design and development services  which are generally performed under contracts of twelve months or less duration  are recognized as costs are incurred utilizing a percentage of completion method  any losses are recognized when anticipated 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand 
net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling  if applicable 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
derivatives and hedging activities all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation 
the company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity 
in june  the company entered into three interest rate swap contracts related to the million in term loans under the credit facility that had a total notional value of million and mature on april  these interest rate swap contracts will pay the company variable interest at the three month libor rate  and the company will pay the counterparties a fixed interest rate 
the fixed interest rates for each of these contracts are  and  respectively 
these interest rate swap contracts were entered into to convert million of the variable rate term loan under the credit facility into fixed rate debt 
based on the terms of the interest rate swap contracts and the underlying debt  these interest rate contracts were determined to be effective  and thus qualify as a cash flow hedge 
as such  any changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
any gain or loss on the derivatives will be recorded in the income statement in interest expense 
the total fair value 
table of contents of these interest rate swap contracts was million at october  and at september   respectively  and the company recorded this amount in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
beginning in july  our malaysian subsidiary entered into twelve separate forward contracts with a total notional value of million  which expire monthly throughout fiscal these forward contracts will fix the foreign exchange rates for our cash required to pay local currency expenses 
the contracts are recorded as liabilities and the changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
the total fair value of the forward contracts was million at october   and the company recorded this amount in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
although our net deferred income tax assets as of october   still reflect a million valuation allowance against certain deferred income tax assets  we may be able to utilize these deferred income tax assets to offset future taxable income in certain states 
we also had a remaining valuation allowance of million related to tax deductions associated with stock based compensation as of october  new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding business combinations whether full  partial or step acquisitions which will result in all assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their fair values 
certain forms of contingent consideration and certain acquired contingencies will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
the guidance also stated acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred and restructuring costs will be expensed in periods after the acquisition date 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and will be effective for the company beginning october   the first day of fiscal in march  the fasb issued authoritative guidance changing the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this guidance requires enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the company adopted this guidance during the second fiscal quarter of the principal impact to the company was to require the expansion of its disclosures regarding its derivative instruments 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which modified the definition of what qualifies as a subsequent event those events or transactions that occur following the balance sheet date  but before the financial statements are issued  or are available to be issued and required companies to disclose the date through which it has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for determining that date 
the company adopted this guidance in the third fiscal quarter of see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe removes the exception from applying the consolidation guidance within this amendment 
this amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a vie 
the amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a vie 
additionally  the amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with vies and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement  as well as how its involvement with vies impacts the enterprise s financial statements 
finally  an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a vie 
this amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on its consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification 
the codification will become the single source for all authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied for 
table of contents financial statements issued for periods ending after september  the codification does not change gaap and the company has determined that it will not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  we have used foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
beginning in july  we entered into twelve separate forward contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated transactions in our asia reportable segment as described in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal year net sales total costs interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions and have entered into interest rate swaps for million in term loans as described in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
our only material interest rate risk is associated with our credit facility under which we borrowed million on april  through the use of interest rate swaps  as described above  we have fixed the basis on which we pay interest  thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk 
a percent change in the weighted average interest rate on our average long term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on net interest expense 
auction rate securities as of october   we held million of auction rate securities  which were classified as long term other assets 
on february   we were unable to liquidate these investments  whose underlying assets were in guaranteed student loans backed by a us government agency 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until a successful auction occurs and these securities are liquidated at par value 
at this time  we believe that the securities will eventually be recovered 
however  we may be required to hold these securities until market stability is restored for these instruments or final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments recorded value 
accordingly  we have classified these securities as long term other assets
