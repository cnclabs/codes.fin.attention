critical accounting policies and estimates certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the reported results of operations and financial position 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
certain accounting policies  however  are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of its board of directors 
net sales revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped fob origin to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale  the risk of loss has been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable 
at the end of each period  for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer  the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer 
the company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors 
revenue billing the company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements 
contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors  costs  and competition 
pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment premium or discount from the company s published price lists 
the customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
returns credits some of the terms of the company s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers distributors the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced 
this practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program 
this program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions 
under certain circumstances usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity  a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer 
if the company approves such a reduction  the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price 
the company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue in accordance with the guidance of fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 paragraph accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 

table of contents the company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit

sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas 
the company properly meets all of the criteria of sfas for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists under staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition 
specifically  the company meets those requirements because the company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale 
the company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company 
the company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product 
all ship and debit and returns to stock require specific circumstances and authorization 
the risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft  physical destruction or damage of the product 
the company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in transit time until the product is delivered for fob destination sales 
the company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by littelfuse 
all distributors are independent of the company 
the company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers 
the company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
volume rebates the company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets 
if customers achieve their sales targets  they are entitled to rebates 
the company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
the company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and  when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and past experience 
historically  the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory the company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory  which include a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  shelf life and quality issues 
based on the analysis  the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities  obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
historically  inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets the company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  or if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired 
management determined the fair value of each of its business unit segments by using a discounted cash flow model which includes forecasted five year income statement and working capital projections  a market based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years to estimate market value 
the company has defined its reportable segments as its reporting units for goodwill accounting 
as of the most recent annual test conducted on september   the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore  no goodwill impairment existed 
specifically  the company noted that its headroom  defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital  was  and for its electronics  automotive and electrical reporting units  respectively  at september  certain key assumptions used in the annual test included electronics automotive electrical discount rate long term growth rate in addition  the company performed a sensitivity test at september  that showed a basis point increase in its discount rate or a basis point decrease in the long term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no goodwill impairment existed at september  the goodwill of a reporting unit also must be tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
as a result of the downturn in the us and global economies  the littelfuse share price and market capitalization decreased in the fourth quarter 
throughout the fourth quarter  management considered whether there were any indicators that the company s goodwill was impaired 
the company concluded that no indicators of impairment were present and therefore an additional impairment test during the fourth quarter was determined to not be required 
the company s conclusion was based on its review of its market capitalization throughout the fourth quarter plus a reasonable control premium  when compared to the company s carrying value of its invested capital 
throughout the fourth quarter  the company s fair value estimate based on its market capitalization plus a reasonable control premium consistently exceeded its carrying value of invested capital 
the company s conclusion that no impairment indicator was present also was based on its expectations for fiscal when compared to the forecast presented in its september  goodwill impairment test 
given the company s headroom by reporting unit at its september  test date  the company performed a sensitivity test on its september  annual test showing the impact of using the revised forecasts to determine if an indicator of impairment was present in any of its reporting units 
the company concluded that although the value of the entity as a whole and each respective reporting unit had declined from its september  test date  the decline in value did not indicate that any reporting unit s fair value would have fallen below its carrying value of invested capital 

table of contents the company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis  if certain conditions exist 
factors the company considers important  which could result in changes to its estimates  include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples 
long lived assets the company evaluates long lived assets on an ongoing basis 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results 
environmental liabilities environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure 
expenses related to on going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred 
if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
pension and supplemental executive retirement plan littelfuse has a number of company sponsored defined benefit plans primarily in north america  europe and the asia pacific region 
historically these plans have been accounted for using sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  and the company recognized the net unfunded status of the plan on the balance sheet 
the company adopted sfas effective december   which requires the full unfunded status of the plan to be recognized

these assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods
