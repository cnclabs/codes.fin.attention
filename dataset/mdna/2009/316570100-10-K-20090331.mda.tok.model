the information below should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future 
such discussion represents only the best present assessment of the management of fieldpoint petroleum corporation 
overview fieldpoint petroleum corporation derives its revenues from its operating activities including sales of oil and natural gas and operating oil and natural gas properties 
the company s capital for investment in producing oil and natural gas properties has been provided by cash flow from operating activities and from bank financing 
the company categorizes its operating expenses into the categories of production expenses and other expenses

table of contents years ended december  costs and expenses boe lease operating production taxes depletion and depreciation impairment of oil and natural gas properties accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations general and administrative total revenues oil and natural gas sales revenues increased by  or  primarily due to increases in oil sales of  oil sales increased due to both higher prices realized during as well as increased volumes 
higher prices contributed  to the increase in oil sales revenues  and increased production contributed an additional  oil sales volumes increased by primarily resulting from the acquisitions of the apache bromide unit and quinoco sulimar consummated in natural gas sales increased  or due primarily to higher prices realized during  offset by lower production resulting from normal declines 
oil and natural gas prices have been volatile during and the company expects this to continue 
fieldpoint s oil and natural gas sales revenue will be highly dependent on commodity prices in lease operating expenses lease operating expenses increased by  or due to a combination of increased costs and increased sales volumes 
costs increased by per barrel equivalent boe or due primarily to repair and maintenance workovers incurred in as compared to many of fieldpoint s properties are mature and bear high operating expense 
increased costs per equivalent unit contributed approximately  of the increase in lease operating expense while increased sales volumes contributed approximately  of the increase 
production taxes production taxes increased  or  primarily the result of increased oil and natural gas sales revenues as discussed above 
production taxes amounted to approximately of oil and natural gas sales revenue during both and management expects production taxes to range between and of oil and natural gas sales revenue 
depletion and depreciation depletion and depreciation expense increased by  or 
the increase in depletion and depreciation was primarily due to higher costs associated with properties acquired 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties impairments recorded during were primarily the result of lower year end commodity prices 
as mentioned elsewhere in this annual report  the company acquired the apache bromide during when commodity prices were higher than those in existence at the end of the impairments in related primarily to properties acquired during impairment charges recorded during were primarily the result of writing off the investment in palo duro basin unproved acreage since the company abandoned plans to develop that property 

table of contents general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses remained substantially constant 
significant components of general and administrative expenses include personnel related costs and professional services fees 
during  there were increases in personnel related costs of approximately  offset by recovered bad debt expense resulting from the full collection of a long overdue joint interest billing receivable for which the company had previously provided an allowance for doubtful accounts amounting to approximately  management expects fieldpoint s general and administrative expenses to remain relatively comparable between years 
other income expense the most significant components of other income and expense are interest expense and unrealized gain and loss on short term investments 
interest expense increased by  or  due primarily to higher outstanding borrowings under the line of credit during as compared to the company borrowed approximately million during to fund acquisitions 
during  fieldpoint repaid approximately million of those amounts and accordingly management expects interest expense to decrease in unless the company borrows additional funds 
short term investments include certificates of deposit and investments in mutual funds 
the value of the company s investment in mutual funds decreased by approximately  during  resulting in a charge to earnings 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the increase in the results of oil and natural gas operations 
during  fieldpoint used its operating cash flow along with cash on hand to fund million of acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties  to repay million of amounts outstanding under the company s revolving line of credit  and to repurchase an aggregate of  shares of fieldpoint common stock for a total purchase price of  the repurchases were undertaken pursuant to a stock buy back program approved by the board of directors 
management continuously searches for opportunities to make cost effective acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties 
further  management evaluates the market price and trading volume of fieldpoint s common stock and may repurchase shares if capital is available and management believes that such repurchase would be advantageous to the company and its stockholders 
capital requirements management believes the company will be able to meet its current operating needs through internally generated cash from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had working capital of approximately million and million of borrowings available under its line of credit based on a borrowing base of million 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination based on the value of proved reserves  and could be decreased during although the company had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at december   management anticipates continued investments in oil and natural gas properties during if bank credit is not available  fieldpoint may not be able to continue to invest in strategic oil and natural gas properties 
management cannot predict how oil and natural gas prices will fluctuate during and what effect they will ultimately have on the company  but management believes that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to service its bank debt and provide for maintaining current production of its oil and natural gas properties 
the timing of most capital expenditures is relatively discretionary 
therefore  the company can plan expenditures to coincide with available funds in order to minimize business risks 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments that affect our consolidated results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the following table is a summary of our significant cash contractual obligations obligation due in period cash contractual obligations thereafter total in thousands credit facility secured interest on credit facility facilities and office leases purchase obligations total 
table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we periodically enter into certain commodity price risk management transactions to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
these transactions may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
all data relating to our derivative positions is presented in accordance with requirements of sfas no 
 which we adopted on january  accordingly  unrealized gains and losses related to the change in fair market value of derivative contracts that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as other comprehensive income or loss and such amounts are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenues as the associated production occurs 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
while such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  management believes these contracts can be utilized as an effective component of commodity price risk management activities 
at december  and december   there were no open positions 
we did not have any derivative transactions during or critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in
