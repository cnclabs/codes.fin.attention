item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional geographic data 
our international business and presence expose us to certain risks  such as currency  interest rate and political risks 
with respect to currency risk  we transact business in different currencies primarily through our foreign subsidiaries 
the fluctuation of currencies impacts sales and profitability 
frequently  sales and the costs associated with those sales are not denominated in the same currency 
we transacted business in approximately thirty nine currencies in fiscal year compared to thirty six currencies in fiscal years and the relative currency mix over the past three fiscal years was as follows fiscal year ended june  of reported revenues exchange rates revenues by currency united states dollar european euro british pound sterling australian dollar swiss franc n a na japanese yen mexican peso canadian dollar singapore dollar all other currencies total calculated using weighted average exchange rates for the fiscal year 
the of reported revenue for all other currencies is calculated based on the weighted average twelve month exchange rates for all other currencies 
the exchange rates as of june for all other currencies represents the weighted average june exchange rates for all other currencies 
weighting is based on the twelve month fiscal year revenue for each country or region 
a increase or decrease in the value of the euro and british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar in fiscal year would have affected total revenues by approximately million  or 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a weighted average change in the exchange rate during the year with all other variables being held constant 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider the effect of exchange rate changes on either cost of sales  operating expenses  or income taxes  and accordingly  is not necessarily an indicator of the effect of potential exchange rate changes on our net income 
we are also subject to interest rate fluctuations in foreign countries to the extent that we elect to borrow in the local foreign currency 
in the past  this has not been an issue of concern as we have the capacity to elect to borrow in other jurisdictions with more favorable interest rates 
we will continue to evaluate the need to invest in financial instruments designed to protect against interest rate fluctuations 
finally  we are subject to  among others  those environmental and geopolitical risks  and economic  pricing  financial  and other risks described in item a  risk factors 
patents and trademarks we hold six patents through our jtech subsidiary 
in general  we believe that  historically  our competitive position has not been materially dependent upon patent protection 
the technology used in the design and manufacture of most of our hardware products is largely licensed or purchased from third parties 
with respect to our software products  we have historically relied on nondisclosure agreements and applicable us and foreign copyright and trademark laws for protection 
in the us and in most other countries  we believe that applicable law has provided and will continue to provide us with sufficient protection 
there are risks that third party entities  including competitors  could attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property 
given these potential risks  we have implemented procedures to monitor misappropriation of its intellectual property 
if a misappropriation is detected  we pursue appropriate legal action when we determine that such action is appropriate

we also own numerous other trademarks and servicemarks 
this annual report on form k also contains trademarks  trade names and servicemarks of other companies that are the property of their respective owners 
fluctuations and customers our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future depending upon various factors  including the timing of new product introductions  changes in our pricing and promotion policies and those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products and the capital expenditure budgets of our customers 
political uncertainty and international events that often are unpredictable  eg  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  and the volatile and unpredictable political climate in the middle east  are expected to continue to adversely impact travel and tourism and therefore our quarterly operating results 
in addition  over the last fiscal year  world macro economic conditions materially worsened  resulting in the failure of several key global financial services providers  and a virtual freezing of the credit markets 
these economic conditions resulted in reduced demand from customers  and the inability of other customers to secure financing for intended purchases 
we believe that these economic conditions have resulted in reduced demand for our products and services 
historically  our business has been affected by seasonal trends 
for example  the european summer holidays tend to lower our sales volume in the european countries during our first fiscal quarter  as compared to other quarters 
we also experience a stronger than average sales volume for the retail products and services in our second fiscal quarter due to the holiday season 
additionally  with the relative slowdown in corporate buying at the beginning of the calendar year  which is our third fiscal quarter  seasonal weakness for the third quarter ending march has been experienced 
therefore  we believe that sequential quarter to quarter historic comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
no single customer accounts for or more of our consolidated revenues 
during the three fiscal years ended june   we have been a party  directly and indirectly  to certain contracts with the us federal government  which contracts contained standard termination for convenience clauses 
our us government related revenue was approximately  and of our total consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact if the us government elected to exercise its rights under a termination for convenience clause 
environmental matters we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and do not anticipate that environmental compliance will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations 
backlog we generally have a backlog of approximately two months revenue  substantially all of which is cancelable at any time before shipment of hardware and software or rendering of services 
as of june   and  the backlog totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically  only an immaterial portion of the backlog existing as of the first day of the fiscal year does not result in recognizable revenue in that fiscal year

item a 
risk factors there are a number of risks to which we are subject 
these risks include the following environmental and geopolitical risks 
while we do not sell our products and services directly to consumers  changes in consumer habits in response to environmental or geopolitical risks affect demand for our products and services by the hospitality and tourism industries 
our business is very sensitive to the threat of terrorism and political uncertainty 
as the hospitality and tourism industries we serve are highly sensitive to consumer sentiments caused by world events  we are very vulnerable to downturns in customer buying habits associated with the threat of terrorist attacks and uncertain political climates  such as those existing in the middle east and parts of asia 
our business is very sensitive to environmental and health disasters 
actual or anticipated environmental disasters and epidemics  including for example  hurricanes  tsunamis  and disease  such as swine flu  will deter and delay purchases of our products by customers  as concerns about potential or anticipated instances of environmental or health disasters tend to suppress travel and tourism 
environmental disasters also adversely affect our operations in the affected areas 
higher oil and gas prices worldwide could have a material adverse impact on the travel and tourism industries  and indirectly  on our business 
material increases in oil and gas prices tend to reduce discretionary spending by consumers  such as on travel and dining  as well as on retail spending generally 
reductions in discretionary spending by consumers adversely affect our customers and  indirectly  our business 
moreover  increases in oil and gas prices also directly adversely affect our customer base in other ways 
for example  gas price increases can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our restaurant customers 
we maintain offices in certain parts of the world that are subject to economic instability  political unrest  and terrorism  such as argentina  brazil  israel and thailand 
the performance of our offices in these areas will be adversely impacted if these regions become subject to economic declines  political strife or episodes of terrorism 
economic  pricing and financial risks 
we are subject to the variability of world economies 
since a substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign countries  a downturn in the economies of foreign countries could adversely affect our financial results 
while  under certain circumstances  reliance on foreign operations can have a moderating impact as one region s improving conditions can offset another region s declining conditions  our foreign businesses nonetheless add a degree of uncertainty to our planning and forecasting process 
we are subject to the global economic crisis 
starting in the summer of  world macro economic conditions materially worsened  resulting in the failure of several key global financial services providers  and a virtual freezing of the credit markets 
these economic conditions resulted in reduced demand from customers  and the inability of other customers to secure financing for intended purchases 
while many economists have noted signs of slow recovery  and credit markets are operating with more efficiencies  the current economic weakness may continue to result in the reduced demand for our products 
these economic conditions have also increased our bad debts and  notwithstanding our efforts to collect on accounts  we may experience greater difficulty in receiving monies that we are owed by our customers 
our quarterly financial results are dependent upon the timing and size of customer orders and the shipment of products for large orders 
large software orders from customers may account for more than an insignificant portion of earnings in any quarter 
we expect the customers with whom we do the largest amount of business to vary from year to year as a result of the timing of the rollout of each customer s system 
further  if a customer delays or accelerates its delivery requirements  or if a product s completion is delayed or accelerated  revenues that we may have expected in a given quarter could be deferred or accelerated into subsequent or earlier quarters  respectively 
these events could have a meaningful effect on our quarterly results 
our ability to establish pricing is subject to rapidly changing market and competitive conditions 
to be competitive and to avoid losing business on the basis of price  we must evaluate our pricing routinely 
there are instances where we may have to reduce our pricing to obtain business 
market forces have and will continue to place pressure on our gross margins and overall profitability 
our gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter based upon product mix 
product mix can affect our operating results 
for example  as we enjoy a higher gross margin on software than on hardware  our overall gross margin will vary depending upon the percentage of software licensed and the percentage of hardware sold each quarter 
because actual product mix is difficult to predict on a quarter to quarter basis  there is uncertainty and variability as to the projected gross margin on a quarter to quarter basis 
our non major account business is difficult to predict 
our major account customers generally those customers who operate or more locations have longer sales cycles and deployments  our non major account sales have much shorter sales cycles and shorter deployments 
as a significant portion of our business involves non major accounts  there is inherent difficulty in predicting buying patterns 
accordingly  it is much harder to appropriately staff and prepare for fluctuations in buying demand for non major account customers 
this can result in inefficiencies that adversely affect our operating results 
some of the advanced systems we sell are very complex and require a high level of technical sophistication  which may result in increased costs that adversely affect our operating results 
the costs of the implementation and operation of an effective service structure capable of addressing increasingly complex software systems in more remote locations is high and may require us to engage contractors  who generally have a higher cost structure than that of our own employees 
the additional costs also reflect the complexity of open systems  which generally incorporate third party software products that may entail difficult and costly support and service  and difficulty in implementing  operating  maintaining and supporting centrally hosted systems  such as central reservation systems  and centrally hosted property management systems and reporting systems 
we are subject to certain material cost increases that may be out of our control 
while we attempt to control third party costs  we have little or no control over certain material expenses  such as health care costs which are generally experience based and costs of compliance with new legislation 
significant increases in any of these expenses could adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies and exchange rates 
because we conduct significant portions of our business in foreign currencies  we experience exchange rate fluctuations that can have a significant impact on our reported results 
for example  as much of our european business is transacted in euros  our revenue on a consolidated basis will decline if the euro weakens relative to the us dollar and increase if the euro strengthens relative to the us dollar 
as a publicly traded company  our stock price is subject to certain market trends that are out of our control and that may not reflect our actual operating performance 
we can experience short term increases and declines in our stock price due to factors other than those specific to our business  such as economic news or other events generally affecting the trading markets 
in this regard  the trading markets generally suffered a precipitous decline during and early in conjunction with the global economic crisis 
we have encountered risks associated with maintaining large cash balances 
while we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments generally considered to be relatively safe  we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks 
for example  the company has invested some of its cash in auction rate securities  which proved to be illiquid when the financial resale markets contracted in february those securities may continue to be illiquid  and there can be no assurance of a return to pre february liquidity levels 
we may continue to experience financial losses if these investments remain illiquid 
additionally  bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts 
technology risks 
our customers requirements are increasingly sophisticated 
to be able to continue to offer competitive products and to meet our customers requirements  we must continually develop and update our products 
unexpected costs and delays in development and implementation  and addressing our commitments to various customers  could adversely affect our financial results 
the development of software is an inherently difficult process that may result in software bugs that adversely impact a customer s business 
while we have a testing and beta program and protocol that we implement before the general release of any product  such processes cannot guarantee that the released software will not have any bugs 
our business could be adversely affected if these problems are significant and not readily resolvable 
the manufacturing of our hardware platform is performed primarily by ges  a company in singapore 
while we believe we have a very good relationship with ges  and while we have not experienced any material manufacturing problems with ges  we cannot be certain that the relationship will remain in force  nor can we be certain that ges will not experience labor or manufacturing challenges in the future  which may include claims of patent infringement with respect to key product components 
additionally  ges procures many of its components from other third parties who could experience manufacturing or labor issues 
we believe that  if our relationship with ges were to terminate  we could readily replace ges with other contract manufacturers or resell appropriate third party hardware products in lieu of those manufactured for us by ges 
however  any disruption or interruption of the supply of hardware products from ges could adversely affect our business in the short run 
large customized deployments may be difficult and may result in cost overruns that are not recoverable 
we have certain contracts under which we are required to provide systems and services at a fixed price 
we may be contractually required to absorb costs that may not be recoverable if we underestimate the amount of work required or if we encounter unanticipated technical issues 
this risk can be pronounced given the complexity of some of the systems we install and the size and scope of some of the deployments 
unanticipated costs that are not recoverable could adversely affect our operations 
our investment in certain technologies may prove to be unsuccessful and may delay our focus on more promising technologies 
as we invest significantly in research and development  there is a risk that we will pursue technology that we ultimately determine is not marketable or does not achieve the desired solution 
in such an event  we may be required to write off our investment  which could have an adverse impact on our operating income 
moreover  if we are delayed in deploying better technologies  our business also could be adversely affected 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities 
our software may be used in connection with processing sensitive data eg  credit card numbers  and is sometimes used to store such data 
it may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures 
in those instances  the customer may attempt to seek damages from us 
while we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we use appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our support and other systems  we cannot assure that our customers systems will not be breached  or that all unauthorized access can be prevented 
if a customer  or other person  seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach  our business could be adversely affected 
hosting of software applications presents increased security and liability risks 
as we expand our software hosting capabilities and offer more of our software applications to our customers on a hosted basis  our responsibility for data and system security with respect to data held in the hosting centers increases 
while we believe that our current software applications comply with applicable laws and industry security requirements  and while we believe that we use appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of unauthorized access or misuse of data in the hosting center  we cannot provide absolute assurance that our hosted systems will not be breached  or that all unauthorized access can be prevented 
if a security breach were to occur  a customer  regulatory agency  or other person could seek redress from us  which could adversely affect our business 
resource and personnel risks 
we could be adversely affected by vendor labor difficulties 
some of our vendors may have employees who are protected by certain labor laws or who may be members of unions 
we could experience unanticipated manufacturing or supply shortages if any of our key vendors are subject to labor difficulties or work slow downs or stoppages 
our inability to hire qualified personnel  including particularly research development personnel  could adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer requirements on an efficient basis 
finding qualified technical personnel in all the localities where our research and development facilities are situated is an ongoing challenge 
if we cannot find appropriate personnel  we risk delays in satisfying customer demands  or may even lose the opportunity to provide software to the customer 
if we are required to retain a consultant because we do not have available personnel  development costs would increase 
in general  our inability to recruit and retain appropriate personnel would adversely affect our business 
legal and accounting risks 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology  these protections do not preclude competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
we cannot guarantee that we can effectively preserve the proprietary nature and competitive advantages of our products  despite our efforts to do so through a combination of trade secrets  copyright  trademark law  non disclosure agreements  and technical measures 
others could attempt to copy what we have developed  either through legal or illegal means 
moreover  others have been able to develop competitive products and services that do not violate our proprietary rights 
we are subject to litigation  which may be costly 
as a company that does business with many customers  employees  and vendors throughout the world  we are subject to litigation  including claims made by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses 
for example  we recently were subject to an adverse jury determination that we were liable for million in damages in connection with the termination of dealer relationships in while we are pursuing an appeal in that particular matter  and while we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation and damages  litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to claims by others that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
from time to time we receive letters from entities that assert that we are infringing a patent 
in those instances  we assess the validity of the claims and the purported patent  and determine whether a license is appropriate or necessary 
if we conclude that a license is not necessary  there is a risk that we will be sued  we may also face indirect liability as a result of infringement claims brought against our customers 
there are currently several actions pending in which some of our customers have been sued on such a claim and have sought indemnity from us 
while we do not believe that any of our products and services infringe any patents  we may become involved in additional patent infringement litigation 
we may incur significant legal expenses and  if we are found liable  significant damages in connection with patent infringement litigation 
credit card issuers have promulgated credit card security guidelines as part of their ongoing effort to battle identity theft and credit card fraud  which may substantially increase our expenses  breaches of our customers credit card security may adversely affect us 
we continue to work with credit card issuers to assure that our products and services comply with the credit card associations security regulations and best practices applicable to our products and services 
we cannot assure  however  that our products and services are invulnerable to unauthorized access or hacking 
additionally  we cannot assure that our customers will implement all of the credit card security features that we introduce  or all of the protections and procedures required by the credit card issuers 
our customers may not establish and maintain appropriate levels of firewall protection and other security measures 
if there is unauthorized access to credit card data that results in financial loss  there is a potential that parties could seek damages from us 
additionally  changes in the security guidelines could require significant and unanticipated development efforts

item legal proceedings we are and have been involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
there is a case pending in the us district court for the northern district of georgia  styled ware v 
abercrombie fitch stores  inc et al  although we are not a party to that case  we may have some obligation to indemnify certain of the defendants who are our customers  based on the terms of our contracts with those customers 
the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants are infringing a patent relating to the processing of credit card transactions 
the defendants include approximately individual retailers  of whom are our customers for retail point of sale software 
we are currently providing indemnity coverage to five of the defendants who are our customers in accordance with applicable provisions of the contracts between us and those customers 
through june   our legal fees with respect to indemnity coverage for this matter have not been material  and we do not anticipate that our future indemnification obligations will be material 
the case was subject to a court ordered stay pending the completion of the united states patent and trademark office s reexamination of the patent that is the subject of the lawsuit 
on july   the united states patent and trademark office issued a reexamination certificate upholding the validity of the patent and the plaintiff moved the court to lift the stay 
as the patent is the subject of another lawsuit that is significantly further along in the litigation process than this case  the defendants are opposing the plaintiff s motion and have also filed a cross motion to continue the stay 
should the case proceed  we will vigorously defend the action and assert all available defenses and arguments 
in any event  based on currently available information  we do not believe that our products infringe the patent 
heartland payment systems  inc  has filed an action in the us district court for the district of new jersey naming as defendants micros systems  inc  merchant link llc  and chase paymentech solutions  llc

heartland claims it has been damaged by virtue of being required to deal with merchant link if it wishes to provide services to users of micros point of sale software  by being required to pay fees to merchant link that it claims are inappropriate or excessive  and by being competitively disadvantaged relative to chase paymentech s services 
heartland seeks monetary damages in excess of million  and also injunctive and other equitable relief 
we and the other defendants have filed answers to the complaint  in which we and the other defendants have denied all material allegations 
we have also asserted counterclaims  alleging that heartland has engaged in tortious activity by defaming and libeling us and by improperly interfering with our customer contracts and customer relationships

micros systems  inc  et al 
and shenango systems solutions v 
micros systems  inc  et al 
the cases initially were filed in in the court of common pleas of allegheny county  pennsylvania 
the complaints both related to the non renewal of dealership agreements in the year between us and the respective plaintiffs 
the agreements were non renewed as part of a restructuring of the dealer channel 
there are no other litigation matters relating to the restructuring of the dealer channel in the year the plaintiffs alleged that we and certain of our subsidiaries and employees entered into a plan to eliminate the plaintiffs as authorized dealers and improperly interfere with the plaintiffs relationships with their respective existing and potential future clients and customers without compensation to the plaintiffs 
as a result  the plaintiffs claimed that we were liable for  among other things  breach of contract and tortious interference with existing and prospective contractual relationships 
we and the plaintiffs have appealed the verdicts on various grounds 
the initial briefs for the appeals are due in september we have established only an immaterial reserve for any potential liability relating to these matters  as we believe that we have raised and can present strong arguments to reverse the verdicts  and therefore believe that an unfavorable outcome in these cases is not probable 
nevertheless  even if the verdicts were not reversed or reduced as a result of the post trial motions or any subsequent appeals  we are of the opinion  based upon presently available information and the advice of counsel concerning pertinent legal matters  that any resulting liability should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity

 revenue recognition in financial statements and in some cases  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  among others 
the application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale includes hardware  software and services or a combination of these items 
our revenue recognition involves judgment  including estimates of fair value in arrangements that contain multiple elements  assessments of the likelihood of nonpayment and estimates of total costs and costs to complete a project 
in making these judgments we analyze various factors  including the nature and terms of the specific transaction  the nature and terms of comparable transactions  the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience  accuracy of prior estimates and overall market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments related to these items  or a deterioration in market or economic conditions deteriorate  could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for limited circumstances when the customer disputes the amounts due to us 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires estimates and is based on the age of the receivable  customer payment practices and history  inquiries  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which could affect our financial results in future periods 
as of june  and  accounts receivable totaled approximately million and million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  bad debt expenses for the fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out pricing method 
we maintain a reserve for obsolescence for inventory in the amount of approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
nevertheless  changes in business trends  competition and other factors not apparent when we make our estimates of inventory obsolescence could result in the need to undertake additional inventory write offs in future periods 
financial instruments and fair value measurements all of our short term investments are recorded at fair value  which approximates cost 
our investments in auction rate securities debt instruments with long term scheduled maturities and periodic interest rate reset dates  classified as long term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as discussed below  are carried at fair value 
we periodically review to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss 
unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are reported  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
prior to april   any unrealized loss identified as other than temporary would have been recorded directly in the consolidated statements of operations 
effective upon our adoption of fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  on april   other than temporary credit loss loss due to security issuer s credit risk is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations  while other than temporary impairment loss related to factors other than credit loss  net of tax  is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we estimate the extent to which other than temporary credit loss or non credit loss was applicable to our investments in auction rate securities 
the factors considered in classifying the impairment include a the credit quality of the underlying security  b the extent to which and time period during which the fair value of each investment has been below cost  c the expected holding or recovery period for each investment  d our intent to hold each investment until recovery  the likelihood that we will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery and our expectation of recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of the security and e the existence of any evidence of default by the issuer 
applying these factors entails significant judgment and considerable uncertainty 
because there does not exist a liquid market or negotiated transaction history with regard to the auction rate securities  we engaged an independent valuation firm to perform a valuation of our investments in auction rate securities at june  and we reviewed and agreed with this valuation 
as of june  and  we held approximately million and million  respectively  in auction rate securities 
as of june   these investments were impaired by approximately million  of which approximately million of the impairment losses were determined to be other than temporary credit losses and recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended june  the remaining impairment losses of approximately million approximately million  net of tax have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as of june  as of june   there were temporary unrealized losses of approximately million approximately million  net of tax on these investments which were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we had no realized gains or losses related to the sale or redemption of our investments in auction rate securities during the three fiscal years ended june  see note financial instruments and fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
a change in factors  including economic conditions  rates of default with respect to the obligations underlying the securities  our liquidity needs  and a variety of other factors may cause our future valuation results to differ  in which case our financial results in future periods could be affected significantly 
capitalized software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of new software products to be licensed to others  primarily consisting of salaries  employee benefits and administrative costs  are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses until technological feasibility is established 
the capitalization of software development costs on a product by product basis starts when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized software development costs begins 
technological feasibility is established when the product reaches the working model stage 
the cost of purchased software is also capitalized 
annual amortization of capitalized software development costs is included in software cost of sales 
for each capitalized software product  the annual amortization is equal to the greater of i the amount computed using the ratio that the software product s current fiscal year gross revenue bears to the total current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or ii the amount computed based on straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
if we incorrectly estimate the remaining economic life of a product or the anticipated future gross revenues of a product  our future financial results could be materially affected if we are required to take a significant write off of capitalized software development costs or to accelerate amortization 
amortization expenses for the fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during the fiscal years and  we wrote off approximately million and million in capitalized software costs  respectively 
no capitalized software costs were written off in fiscal year valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when indicators of impairment are present  we compare the fair value of the asset groups  based on the undiscounted cash flows the asset groups are expected to generate or market value  if available  to the net book value of the asset groups 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the asset group is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the net book value over the fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the asset groups for the purposes of our analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these asset groups 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the company 
a change in assumptions and estimates in future periods could cause us to determine that asset groups are impaired  resulting in a significant charge in future periods 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  we assess annually  in the first quarter of the fiscal year  whether goodwill and certain of our trademarks  which are our only indefinite lived purchased intangible assets  are impaired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units our four operating segments consisting of us  europe  the pacific rim and latin america to their book value 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on a weighting of future income approach ie  discounted future income and market approach ie  comparison to the purchase and sale of similar assets in the relevant industry 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if goodwill is impaired  we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 
trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing their fair value to book value 
we estimate the fair value of trademarks using an income approach to value  and recognize an impairment loss if the estimated fair value of a trademark is less than its book value 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances indicating that it is more likely than not that the book value of goodwill and or trademarks has been impaired 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and or trademarks is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the purposes of our annual or interim analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying reporting units and factor in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  factoring in customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
additionally  these cash flow analyses factor in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date the analysis is performed 
a determination that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired which could result from a change in our assumptions could result in a significant charge in future periods 
as of june  and  goodwill totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
share based compensation we account for our option awards granted under our stock option program in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the estimated fair value of option awards granted under the stock option program are measured as of the date of grant  and non cash share based compensation expenses  adjusted for expected pre vesting forfeitures  are recognized ratably over the requisite service ie vesting period of options in the consolidated statement of operations 
we value stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions 
therefore  we are required to input highly subjective assumptions about volatility rates  expected term of options  dividend yields and applicable interest rates in the option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical stock prices 
the expected term of options granted is based on historical option activities  adjusted for the remaining option life cycle by assuming ratable exercise of any unexercised vested options over the remaining term 
for this purpose  we separate groups of employees that have historically exhibited similar behavior with regard to option exercises and post vesting cancellations 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
total expense recorded from period to period can be significantly different depending on several variables  including the number of options granted  any changes to assumptions such as pre vesting cancellations and the estimated fair value of those vested awards 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination is made 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities could be materially affected if  based on subsequent events  we determine that we must derecognize or recognize a tax position 
such a change also could materially affect our annual tax rate in the year in which the change occurs 
although we are profitable on a consolidated basis  we have incurred losses in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we applied valuation allowances in some circumstances where the prospects of realizing the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards are subject to uncertainty 
the determination of the likelihood of realizing this tax benefit requires significant judgment in some instances  and actual results of our operating subsidiaries  particularly certain international subsidiaries  could result in material adjustments to our deferred tax assets or liabilities  and changes in our annual tax rate in the year in which the adjustments occur 
effective july   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
among other things  fin requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
the net unrecognized income tax benefits as of june  and were approximately million and million  including interest and penalties of approximately million and million  respectively 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax positions and evaluating uncertainties relating to these positions

a partially offsetting million decrease in the foreign currency exchange transaction loss from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year income tax expense the effective tax rates for fiscal years and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the fiscal years and were less than the us statutory federal income tax rate  mainly due to final settlement of certain tax audits resulting in a decrease of certain unrecognized tax positions  tax benefits realized upon the expiration of statutes of limitations  the mix of earnings from jurisdictions that have a lower statutory tax rate than the us and the phase in of the deduction for domestic production activities 
these benefits were partially offset by the non deductible nature of certain non cash share based compensation items  valuation allowances  other non deductible compensation items  non deductible foreign withholding taxes and the inclusion of foreign income in our us tax base 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to the final settlement of certain tax audits  and the expiration of statutes of limitations resulting in a decrease of certain unrecognized tax positions and other non deductible compensation 
effective july   we adopted the provisions of fin  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  and classification of the effect of a tax position  recognition of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin of approximately million  including interest and penalties of million  was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings and an increase in income taxes payable 
we recorded net unrecognized income tax benefits of approximately million and million  including accrued interest and penalties of approximately million and million at june  and  respectively 
we have recognized approximately million of interest expense for each of the fiscal years and the non current portion of the net unrecognized income tax benefits represents benefits with respect to which we do not anticipate making a payment within months of the balance sheet date 
if recognized  all of the net unrecognized income tax benefit would be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense  impacting the effective income tax rate 
we have reviewed our uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fin we have recognized a decrease of certain unrecognized tax positions in fiscal year due to the expiration of statutes of limitations and final settlement of certain tax audits for tax years to  which resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of approximately million  and impacted the effective income tax rate 
we estimate that within the next months  we will decrease the unrecognized income tax benefits by approximately million to million due to the expiration of statues of limitations and settlement of issues with tax authorities  which we believe would increase earnings as a result of the impact of decreased unrecognized tax benefits on the effective tax rate 
however  audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty 
further  over the next months  it is reasonably possible that our tax positions will continue to generate liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
we historically classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
we have maintained this practice following our adoption of fin in the ordinary course of our business  transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome may be uncertain 
in addition  tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include examination of our significant tax filing positions  including the timing and amounts of deductions and the allocation of income and expenses among tax jurisdictions 
our major taxing jurisdictions include australia  ireland  germany  singapore  the united kingdom and the united states 
net income and diluted net income per common share net income for fiscal year decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million  compared to fiscal year the decrease is mainly due to an overall decrease in sales volume and overall lower interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments

fsp fas clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured 
fsp fas and fas establishes a new model for measuring other than temporary impairments for debt securities  including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write down through earnings versus other comprehensive income 
fsp fas and apb expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  to interim periods 
as a result of adopting these fsps  we recognized other than temporary credit based impairment losses of approximately million related to our investments in auction rate securities and have recorded the losses in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june  adoption of these fsps also expanded our associated disclosures 
sfas on july   we adopted sfas  fair value measurements  for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements

such statements include the following i our statements about the growth and direction of the hospitality and retail industries generally  and our analysis of the growth and direction of various sectors within those industries  ii our expectation that product and service margins may decline in response to the competitive nature of our market  iii our statements regarding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations in particular  euro and british pound sterling on our financial performance  iv our expectations that the customers with whom we do the largest amount of business will fluctuate from year to year  and our statements about the effects of large customer orders on our quarterly earnings  revenues  and total revenues  v our statements regarding the impact on financial results in future periods if we determine that the financial condition of customers has deteriorated  vi our statements regarding the impact on financial results in future periods if we misjudge the remaining economic life of a product  vii our statements concerning the fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  whether as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results or other factors  viii our belief that any existing legal claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position  ix our beliefs about our competitive strengths  x our expectations regarding effective tax rates in future periods  xi our expectations regarding the impact or lack of impact on our financial position and results of operations of the application of recent accounting standards  xii our expectations about the adequacy of our cash flows and our available lines of credit to meet our working capital needs  and our ability to raise additional funds if and when needed  xiii our expectations about our capital expenditures for future periods  xiv our expectations that our exposure to interest rate risk will not materially change in the future  xv our expectation that we will evaluate our need to invest in instruments to protect against interest rate fluctuations and our exposure to such interest rate risk  xvi our statements about the effects on our revenue recognition as a result of changes to a customers delivery requirements or a products completion  xvii our statements regarding our ability to increase sales of our higher margin products  xviii our expected costs associated with modifying our products to comply with applicable legal rules  regulations  and guidelines  including the credit card associations security and data protection rules  and xix our expectations regarding valuation and liquidity of auction rate securities in which we have invested 
there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
these may include changes in applicable laws and regulations  other activities of governments  governmental agencies  or other regulatory bodies that affect our products  services  or business operations  changes in accounting and auditing rules and changes in the interpretations of those rules  as well as those matters described in item a  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
see foreign sales and foreign market risks in part business  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  above for information regarding foreign currency exchange risks 
our committed lines of credit bear interest at a floating rate  which exposes us to interest rate risks 
we manage our exposure to this risk by minimizing  to the extent feasible  overall borrowing and monitoring available financing alternatives 
at june   we had total borrowings of approximately million  and had not entered into any instruments to hedge the resulting exposure to interest rate risk 
management believes that the fair value of the debt equals its carrying value at june  and june  our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under the line of credit 
as our total borrowing as of june  was approximately million  a change in interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities  including auction rate securities  are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed interest rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
should interest rates fluctuate by  the change in value of our marketable securities would not have been material as of june   and the change in our interest income would not have changed by a material amount for the year then ended 
to minimize our exposure to credit risk associated with financial instruments  we place our temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions  generally with bond rating of a and above
