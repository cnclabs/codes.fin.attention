item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading the impact of seasonality and cyclicality  which is incorporated herein by reference  for a discussion of the extent to which our business is seasonal 
employees as of december   we had employees located at our corporate headquarters in kirkland  washington 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced employment related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good 
available information our financial statements for the three years ended december   are included in item of this report 
our internet address is www

on the investor relations section of our web site  we provide free access to our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and 
table of contents any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec 
the information found on our web site is not a part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the sec 
in addition  our filings are available at the sec s web site www 
sec 
gov and at the sec s public reference room at f street  ne  washington  dc  or by calling sec item a risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors that may affect our business  future operating results and financial condition  as well as other information included in this annual report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause our stock price to decline 
we have reported net losses for the past three years 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
our revenues are unpredictable and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to changes in rates of customer acquisition and retention  the cyclical nature of the real estate industry  and other factors outside of our control 
in addition  our expenses and revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to  among other factors  the timing of sales and marketing campaigns 
our reported net losses have included significant impairment charges due in part to the decline in our business and our lower market capitalization 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our past operating results may not be good indicators of our future performance and should not be relied on to predict the future performance of our stock price 
it is possible that in the future our operating results will not meet the expectations of investors  causing the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the past  companies that have experienced decreases in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
a securities class action lawsuit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
our operating results may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the real estate industry 
our business is dependent on the health of the residential real estate industry 
the residential real estate market historically has been subject to economic cycles 
an economic slowdown or recession  adverse tax policies  lower availability of credit  increased interest rates  or other factors that impact consumer confidence could decrease demand for residential real estate 
for example  our revenues have declined over the past two years due in part to the national downturn in the real estate industry  including a decrease in the number of real estate professionals  and the economic slowdown 
trends in the real estate industry are unpredictable  therefore  our operating results  to the extent they reflect changes in the broader real estate industry  may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and expect that competition will continue to be intense 
the barriers to entry in our industry are low  making it possible for current or new competitors to adopt certain aspects of our business model without great financial expense  thereby reducing our ability to differentiate our services 
all of our services  including online lead generation  online prospect management  online real estate portal content and advertising  and customer coaching and training  are provided in part or in combination by other companies 
one or more of these companies  or a new market entrant  could adopt a business model that competes directly with us  which could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 

table of contents our current and potential competitors include traditional sellers of advertising to real estate professionals 
we compete with traditional sellers of advertising  including local and regional newspapers  local magazines  and rack publications advertising homes for sale  for a share of the marketing dollars that residential real estate professionals spend to attract prospective home buyers and sellers 
real estate professionals may continue to view traditional advertising sources as the most effective means to reach prospective home buyers and sellers  leading to a lack of demand for our services 
if we fail to persuade these customers to spend marketing dollars on our services  our business and operating results will suffer 
internet media companies 
we compete with large internet media companies  such as aol  google  msn and yahoo for real estate professionals marketing dollars 
some of the large internet media companies are currently developing enhanced search products  including search products that would allow a user to find real estate related search results in a specific city or geographic area 
if their existing or new products become a cost effective way for real estate professionals to generate leads  these products may become an attractive alternative to our services  which could decrease demand for our services or increase our online advertising costs 
additionally  these companies  on which we rely in part for our own advertising and lead generation needs  may develop or acquire products and services that compete directly with our services 
online companies focused on residential real estate 
we compete with a variety of online marketing and lead generation companies that focus exclusively on the real estate industry 
such companies include homes 
com and trader publishing  classified ventures and homegain  realestateabc of internetbrands  reply 
com  zillow  realtor 
com  homestore and move 
com and iac interactivecorp  which includes domania 
com  servicemagic and realestate 
com  all of which have established web sites and compete or may compete for real estate professionals advertising expenditures 
in addition  consolidation driven by online service providers involved in the real estate industry and internet media companies could create more potent competitors 
increased consolidation among online service providers in the residential real estate industry could result in additional competitors that have significantly greater resources or greater brand recognition than we do  and that are able to provide a broader and more attractive suite of services to real estate professionals than we can 
traditional real estate brokerage firms 
some real estate brokerage firms currently offer services similar to ours  and in the future these firms and other brokerage franchise firms may become direct competitors 
a significant percentage of residential real estate professionals are affiliated with large national or regional brokerage firms 
if brokerage firms decide to provide their agents with a service offering or suite of service offerings similar to ours at a lower cost or free of charge  or if they attempt to restrict the ability of their agents to use our services  demand for our services by real estate professionals could decrease 
discounted and non traditional real estate brokerage firms 
some companies have extended their focus on online consumers to discount and non traditional real estate brokerages 
companies such as redfin  ziprealty  and others offer similar consumer information services as well as discounted transaction fees to home buyers and sellers 
while more directly competitive with traditional brokerage firms  these companies compete with us for the online consumers 
additionally  services such as forsalebyowner 
com  fsbo 
com  mlsowners 
com  and letsgofizbo 
com offer home sellers relatively low and often fixed fee services that compete with the traditional real estate brokerage firms and their agents  including those in our customer base 
success of these discounted and non traditional brokerages could reduce traditional real estate professionals that we believe represent the majority of our customer base 
therefore  demand for our services by real estate professionals could decrease 
many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  greater technological capabilities or greater financial  sales  marketing and human resources than we do 
these competitors could do any of the following  which could adversely impact our business and operating results develop services that are as effective as or superior to our services or that achieve greater market acceptance than do our services  
table of contents devote greater resources to marketing or selling their services  withstand price competition more successfully than we can  make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees or independent contractors than we do  more effectively negotiate third party arrangements  and take advantage of investments  acquisitions or other opportunities more readily than we can 
any efforts to expand into new lines of business and offer new products may not be successful  or may take longer than expected to complete 
new initiatives we may pursue may not be successful or the anticipated benefits may take longer to realize than expected 
also  we may have little or no experience in these areas which may result in errors in the conception  structure or implementation of a strategy to take advantage of available opportunities 
for example  we launched and acquired products targeted at mortgage professionals in due to deteriorating market conditions  operational challenges  and increasing competition in this market  we did not meet our financial objectives and decided to discontinue or stop selling these products in january in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of realty generator 
realty generator provided services to real estate brokers  including a web site  a proprietary customer relationship management tool that enables communication with prospective customers  past clients and local real estate professionals  marketing materials and dedicated training and account management support 
the systems are integrated such that the leads generated from the web site traffic are distributed to the agent teams  allowing brokers to monitor agent follow through 
we cannot assure you that the realty generator acquisition or any new products or other expansion efforts will be successful 
any failure to increase the number of our customers would harm our business 
growth of our business depends in large part on increasing the number of our customers 
however  prospective customers may not be familiar with our services and may be accustomed to using traditional methods of advertising and marketing 
to attract more customers  we must convince real estate professionals to spend a portion of their advertising and marketing budgets on our services 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to acquire customers or that we will be able to acquire them at the same rate that we have historically 
if we reach the point at which we have attempted to sell our services to the majority of residential real estate professionals  our ability to further increase the number of customers could be limited 
we may not know or be able to estimate when we have reached this point because we currently cannot reliably estimate the total number of residential real estate professionals that are actively engaged in the industry during any particular period and media reports indicate that the total number of real estate professionals are expected to decline because of negative trends in the real estate industry 
any failure to retain customers could harm our business 
our ability to retain our customers will depend on our ability to generate web site traffic and leads from prospective home buyers and sellers in quantities demanded by our customers  to enhance our existing services  develop new technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of customers  respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a timely manner and on a cost effective basis 
if we do not deliver the web site traffic or quantity and quality of leads expected by our customers  maintain adequate technical support levels  or continue to improve the ease of use  functionality and features of our prospect management systems  customer coaching and training offerings  or if customers are dissatisfied with the quality of the leads that we provide  our customers may choose not to extend their contracts for our services or may choose to terminate their contracts 

table of contents real estate professionals remain customers typically only for a limited period of time  and we have limited ability to predict how long they will remain customers 
the majority of our customer contracts have an initial term of twelve months  with automatic one month extensions unless terminated by either party 
some customers have decided not to extend their contracts due to their inability to convert the leads we have provided into closed transactions  due to their dissatisfaction with our services  or their inability to pay for our services 
we cannot accurately predict how long real estate professionals will remain customers 
we have experienced a decreased rate of customer retention since  and if our retention rate continues to decline  our revenue will further decline and our business will suffer 
acquisitions we may undertake may be unsuccessful and may divert our management s attention and consume significant resources 
we may selectively acquire other businesses  product lines or technologies 
the successful execution of an acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and  if necessary  to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses  entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions  dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  reduction or replacement of the sales of existing services by sales of products or services from acquired lines of business  responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses  inability to maintain our internal standards  controls  procedures and policies  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may not be successful  and if we are unable to effectively manage the risks described above or other risks we encounter  our business  operating results or financial condition may be negatively affected 
for example  we acquired the loan page in october as part of our strategic objective to capitalize on the synergies between real estate and mortgage professionals 
due to deteriorating market conditions  operational challenges  and increasing competition in this market  we did not meet our financial objectives and decided in january to discontinue the semi exclusive lead product we obtained as part of that acquisition 
our revenues were lower in due in part to this decision  and we recorded a significant impairment loss in related to that acquisition 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky  and we cannot assure you that our acquisitions will be successful 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could harm our business 
we may be required to take an impairment charge for goodwill or other long lived asset  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
we have acquired certain portions of our business through acquisitions and may continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies as part of our long term business strategy 
in connection with prior acquisitions  we have accounted for the portion of the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired 
table of contents as goodwill and may be required to do so for future acquisitions 
additionally  we have invested in other long lived assets designed to enhance our product offerings or assist in achieving our business plan for our company 
under the applicable accounting rules  goodwill is not amortized and is carried on our books at its original value  subject to periodic review and evaluation for impairment  whereas intangible and fixed assets are amortized or depreciated over the life of the asset 
our common stock has recently been trading below our book value per share 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million in and we expect to conduct further impairment reviews 
if  as a result of our periodic review and evaluation of our goodwill and other long lived assets for potential impairment  we determine that changes in the business itself  the economic environment including business valuation levels and trends  or the legislative or regulatory environment have adversely affected either the fair value of the business or the fair value of our assets  we may be required to take additional impairment charges 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate further  this could increase the likelihood that we will need to record additional impairment charges 
while we have a plan to restore our business fundamentals to levels that would support our book value per share  we have no assurance that the plan will be achieved or that the market price of our common stock will increase to such levels in the foreseeable future 
in that event  we may be required to take an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill  exceed the fair value of our overall business  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
we rely almost entirely on advertising to generate leads for customers 
we rely heavily on advertising to attract consumers to our web sites and to generate traffic and leads 
we advertise primarily through online media and television commercials 
business risks associated with online advertising 
we rely on online media to attract a significant percentage of the consumers visiting our web sites 
prices for online advertising have increased as a result of increased demand for advertising inventory  which has caused our expenses to increase and has resulted in lower margins 
our advertising contracts with online search engines are typically short term 
if one or more search engines on which we rely for advertising modifies or terminates its relationship with us  our expenses could further increase  the number of leads we generate could decrease and our revenues or margins could decline 
business risks associated with television advertising 
television advertising rates depend on a number of factors  including the strength of the national economy and regional economies and the strength of certain industries that advertise frequently 
advertising rates are also subject to cyclical and seasonal fluctuations 
if television advertising prices increase significantly or if the effectiveness of this advertising declines  in the absence of more efficient ways to generate leads  our marketing expenses will also increase  which would harm our results of operations 
if we are required to drive additional traffic for an increasing customer base or if the number of leads that we are required to deliver increases  we may be required to increase the levels of advertising to meet those requirements 
increasing our advertising expenditures may not result in increases in traffic or leads 
if the effectiveness of our advertising declines  our business will suffer 
we may invest our cash in securities that become illiquid or that significantly decrease in value 
we may invest our cash in securities that are affected by adverse market conditions 
current market conditions and lack of investor confidence have led to reduced liquidity in securities that had previously been viewed as more liquid 
as a result  our investments may decline in value  or we may not be able to access our cash equivalents or short term investments when needed for strategic investment purposes or for operations and capital expenditures 
loss of cash value and inability to access funds would harm our business 

table of contents we may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims 
other companies  including our current or potential competitors  could make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights 
we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to  claims regarding alleged infringement by us of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
any intellectual property claims  regardless of merit  could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle  and could significantly divert management s attention from other business concerns 
we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights  but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our technologies and content may not be able to withstand third party claims or rights against their use 
if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims  we may have to pay damages  stop using the technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights  seek a license for the infringing technology or content  or develop alternative non infringing technology or content 
if we are required to obtain a license for the infringing technology or content  it may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  developing alternative non infringing technology or content could require significant effort and expense 
if we cannot license or develop technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business  we may be forced to limit our service offerings 
any of these results could reduce our ability to compete effectively and harm our business 
our trademarks are important to our business 
other companies may own  obtain or claim trademarks that could prevent  limit or interfere with our use of trademarks 
if we were unable to use these trademarks  our business would be harmed and we would need to devote substantial resources toward developing different brand identities 
we have a limited operating history  our business model is evolving and our future operating results are unpredictable 
we were formed in may and have a limited history upon which to evaluate our operations and future prospects 
there is little significant historical basis to assess how we will adapt our business model to competitive  economic or technological challenges 
the ongoing downturn in the real estate markets provides some indication that our business may follow cyclical trends 
our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the earlier stages of development 
the success of our business model depends on our ability to attract new and retain existing customers and to efficiently generate traffic and leads 
any failure to execute this strategy could harm our business 
our business model is relatively new and is still evolving 
further  because our newer vision based products allow customers to adjust their advertising expenditure as business needs dictate  our revenue may become more variable 
additionally  because the margin on advertising revenue is less than that of software subscriptions  overall margins may be more variable and lower depending upon the mix of advertising revenue 
we may have to increase our expenses as we seek to expand our business and diversify our product mix 
we cannot assure you that our strategies to return to growth will be successful or that we will return to profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
prospective home buyers and sellers may be reluctant to sign up for our services due to general privacy concerns 
concern among consumers regarding our use of personal information collected on our web sites  such as email addresses  home addresses and geographic preferences  could keep them from using our web sites and thereby reduce the number of leads we generate 
industry wide events or events with respect to our web sites  including misappropriation of third party information  security breaches  or changes in industry standards  regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our web sites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information  which could harm our business 

table of contents we rely on the collection  use and disclosure of personally identifiable information from prospective home buyers and sellers and from customers to conduct our business 
we disclose our information collection and dissemination practices in a published privacy statement on our web sites  which we may modify from time to time to meet operational needs or changes in the law or industry best practices 
we may be subject to legal claims  government action and damage to our reputation if we act or are perceived to be acting inconsistently with the terms of our privacy statement  customer expectations or the law 
in addition  concern among real estate professionals or potential home buyers or sellers about our privacy practices could keep them from using our services and require us to alter our business practices or incur significant expenses to educate them about how we use this information 
further  changes in laws and regulations applicable to the privacy of personal information or in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws or regulations  could require us to modify our practices regarding use  collection  protection and disclosure of such information 
any required modifications could result in significant expenses to us 
the value of our services could be diminished if anti spam software filters out emails we send 
our prospect management systems includes a feature that automatically sends out personalized email messages to prospective home buyers and sellers on behalf of real estate professionals who are our customers 
in addition  we send a large amount of email to real estate professionals as part of our customer acquisition strategy  some of which is unsolicited 
in the past  anti spam software used by internet service providers and personal computer users has filtered out these email messages as unsolicited email  or spam 
if this problem persists or becomes more pervasive  the value of our prospect management system to customers  and our ability to attract new customers  could be reduced  both of which would harm our business 
in addition  it is possible that we may not currently or in the future fully comply with anti spam legislation  and any failure to comply with such laws could result in penalties or damage our reputation 
our homepages  justlisted  growth leader  team leader and realtygenerator products rely on information from real estate multiple listing services provided by third parties that we do not control 
our homepages web site and the web sites we provide to our growth leader agent customers and our realtygenerator broker customers combine aerial maps and for sale home listings  including listings in most of the major metropolitan markets in the united states 
in addition  in selected markets  including most of the major metropolitan markets in the united states  we provide justlisted  growth leader  team leader  and realtygenerator customers with a feature that allows them to automatically email their prospective clients information about newly available homes that meet the prospective clients criteria 
the for sale home listings information provided by our web sites and the automated email feature of services are supplied only in markets in which we or our broker customers have a relationship with the local multiple listing service mls  and in some cases  additionally with the agents real estate broker 
listings must be sent manually by an agent customer in markets in which we do not have mls relationships 
our agreements with mlss to display property listings have short terms  or can be terminated by the mlss  or  in some cases  the broker  with little notice 
the success of our homepages web site depends substantially on our continued ability to provide for sale home listings to consumers and to expand listings in markets in which it is not currently available 
our justlisted service depends in part on our continued ability to provide customers with an automated listing email tool and our ability to expand listings in markets in which it is not currently available 
our growth leader  team leader  and realtygenerator services depend on our ability to leverage our customers access to mls data 
our inability to supply this information will harm our business and operating results 
if we fail to comply with the various laws and regulations that govern the real estate industry  our business may be harmed 
our business is governed by various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the real estate industry  including the real estate settlement procedures act respa  the fair housing act  state and local real estate broker licensing laws  federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and practices  and 
table of contents federal and state advertising laws 
we may not have always been and may not always be in compliance with each of these requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in  among other things  revocation of required licenses  indemnification liability to contract counterparties  class action lawsuits  administrative enforcement actions and civil and criminal liability 
due to the geographic scope of our operations and the nature of the services we provide  we may be required to obtain and maintain real estate brokerage licenses in certain states in which we operate 
in connection with such licenses  we are required to designate individual licensed brokers of record 
we cannot assure you that we are  and will remain at all times  in full compliance with state real estate licensing laws and regulations and we may be subject to fines or penalties in the event of any non compliance 
if in the future a state agency were to determine that we are required to obtain a real estate brokerage license in that state in order to receive payments or commissions from real estate professionals  or if we lose the services of a designated broker  we may be subject to fines or legal penalties or our business operations in that state may be suspended until we obtain the license or replace the designated broker 
any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may limit our ability to expand into new markets  offer new products or continue to operate in one or more of our current markets 
we may be limited in the way in which we market our business or generate revenue by federal law prohibiting referral fees in real estate transactions 
respa generally prohibits the payment or receipt of fees or any other thing of value for the referral of business related to a residential real estate settlement service  including real estate brokerage services 
respa also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services 
notwithstanding these prohibitions  respa expressly permits payments pursuant to cooperative brokerage and referral arrangements or agreements between real estate agents and brokers 
in addition  respa permits payments for goods or facilities furnished or for services actually performed  so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or facilities furnished or the services performed  excluding the value of any referrals that may be provided in connection with such goods  facilities or services 
failure to comply with respa may result in  among other things  administrative enforcement actions  class action lawsuits  and civil and criminal liability 
there has been limited guidance by the appropriate federal regulator or the courts regarding the applicability of respa to online marketing relationships for real estate or mortgage services  including those we provide 
nonetheless  respa may restrict our ability to enter into marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties  particularly to the extent that such arrangements may be characterized as involving payments for the referral of residential real estate settlement service business 
we rely on our sales force to sell our services and increase revenue 
failure to attract  motivate and retain qualified sales personnel may harm our business 
we have high productivity standards for our sales personnel  which in the past has resulted in relatively high turnover 
this turnover has required us to expend a substantial amount of time and money to replace sales persons as we expand our business 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense 
any failure to attract  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel could impair our ability to generate new customers  which would harm our business 
our business could be harmed by the actions of third parties over whom we have little or no control 
prospective home buyers and sellers could make a claim against us for the actions of a real estate agent or broker customer over whom we have little or no control 
we do not conduct any due diligence or background checks on new customers or seek information regarding their credentials 
we may be liable for content provided 
table of contents by customers that is posted on or disseminated through our web sites 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover us for these liabilities  and  to the extent not covered by insurance  these liabilities could reduce our margins and harm our business 
our brand could be harmed if customers do not provide quality service to prospective home buyers and sellers 
we rely on real estate professionals who are our customers of our justlisted and housevalues products to promote our brand by providing high quality service to prospective home buyers and sellers 
we have little control over the activities of customers 
if customers do not provide prospective home buyers and sellers with high quality service  or if they use the functionality of our market leader system to send unwanted email to prospective home buyers or sellers  our brand value and our ability to generate leads may diminish 
our operating results may be subject to seasonality and may vary significantly among quarters during a calendar year 
we are subject to seasonal fluctuations in advertising rates and lead generation 
changing consumer behavior at various times throughout the year affects our advertising expenses 
television advertising is generally more expensive in the fourth calendar quarter in connection with the holiday season 
while individual markets vary  real estate transaction activity tends to progressively increase from january through the summer months  and then gradually slows over the last quarter of the calendar year 
the real estate industry generally experiences decreased activity toward the end of the year  which may result in slower lead generation and lower growth rates 
throughout the history of our company  our quarterly revenue changes have masked seasonality effects 
as a result  investors may be unable to predict our annual operating results based on a quarter to quarter comparison of our operating results as our business matures 
third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  the value of our services could be diminished and our business may suffer 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and on our continuing use of our trademarks 
we hold eleven registered trademarks and have sought registration for a number of additional trademarks 
we have not sought registration for any copyrights 
we have not been issued any patents but we have four pending patent applications 
accordingly  our intellectual property position is more vulnerable than it otherwise would be if it were protected by issued patents  copyrights or additional registered trademarks 
we may not receive approval of our various trademark or patent applications  and any trademarks or patents we may be granted may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
if our trademark or patent applications are not approved or if our trademarks or patents are invalidated  our use of them could be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with these third parties  which might not be possible on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we regard substantial elements of our web sites  software tools and applications and underlying technology as proprietary 
despite our precautionary measures  third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or may develop similar technology independently 
we may not be able to detect such infringements or may lose any competitive advantage in the market before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies substantially similar to ours 
unauthorized parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our technology 
our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
any legal action that 
table of contents we may bring to protect our proprietary information could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving  and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights 
increased government regulation of the internet and claims under state consumer protection laws could force us to change the manner in which we conduct our business or result in monetary fines or increased costs 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on us 
laws and regulations relating to communications or commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
in addition  the interpretation and application of laws applicable to the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws  such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation  apply to the internet 
new laws and regulations  and changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations relating to the internet  could lead to situations in which we are considered to operate or do business in states where customers conduct their business  resulting in potential claims or regulatory action 
if we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations  or if we are unable to comply with these laws or regulations  our business could be harmed 
our practices may not have always been and may not always be in compliance with the requirements of internet related laws or regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative enforcement actions  class action lawsuits  and civil and criminal liability 
we may be subject to claims under state consumer protection statutes if our customers are dissatisfied with the quality of our leads  customer service  training programs or contract cancellation policies 
these claims could result in monetary fines or require us to change the manner in which we conduct our business  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any of these types of claims  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  could harm our reputation and could be expensive to litigate or settle 
for example  in november we entered into a consent decree with the washington state attorney general s office and agreed to pay  in costs and attorney s fees and to modify certain of our business practices and procedures 
changes in government regulation of advertising and customer solicitation could affect our business 
we rely on various marketing channels  such as email and other means of electronic and telephonic communication  to reach real estate professionals and prospective home buyers and sellers and other consumers 
the laws governing marketing and advertising continue to evolve and we may be subject to restrictions that limit our ability to continue to operate or expand our business and could result in legal claims or government action 
for example  a federal statute places restrictions on unsolicited commercial email  commonly known as spam  and imposes obligations upon senders of commercial email 
additionally  state laws governing falsity or deception with regard to email apply in addition to the federal statute 
these federal and state laws impose significant civil and criminal penalties for violations 
as the interpretation and enforcement of these laws evolve  they may impose burdens on our email marketing practices and affect features of our customer relationship management systems and other services we offer or may offer 
in addition  federal and state statutes prohibiting false or deceptive acts in commerce apply to internet advertising  and some states have passed legislation regulating internet advertising 
the requirements of some of these laws  and their interpretation and enforcement by governmental authorities  are not clear and uniform 
these laws may adversely affect our ability to market our services to real estate industry participants in a cost effective manner and the violation of these laws may result in enforcement actions and penalties or damage our reputation 

table of contents our sales activities are or may in the future be subject to laws regulating telemarketing  which could subject us to penalties or limit our ability to market our services 
both federal and state laws regulate the practice of telemarketing and placing other commercial telephone calls 
all states have enacted some form of telemarketing law  and federal statutes and regulations place restrictions on live  recorded and text telemarketing calls 
in particular  the federal government and a significant number of states have implemented do not call lists 
in addition  a number of states require telemarketers to register with the state and post a bond  regulate or prohibit automated systems and recorded messages  impose disclosure requirements upon sales calls and require written sales contracts for certain telemarketing transactions 
we are subject to certain of these laws  and our failure to register in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to penalties  limit our ability to market our services and hamper our ability to enforce contracts in these jurisdictions 
other violations of these laws may damage our reputation and may result in administrative enforcement  fines and civil or criminal penalties 
any failure of our technology to perform satisfactorily could result in lost revenue  damage to our reputation and expenditure of significant resources 
our technology is relatively new and complex and may in the future be subject to errors  defects or performance problems 
in addition  we may encounter problems when we update our technology to expand and enhance its capabilities 
our technology may malfunction or suffer from defects that become apparent only after further use 
furthermore  our services could be rendered unreliable or be perceived as unreliable by customers or prospective home buyers and sellers 
in such instances  we would need to expend significant resources to address these problems  and may nonetheless be unable to adequately remedy these problems 
these problems could result in lost revenue and damage to our reputation 
sustained or repeated system failures could significantly impair our operations and lead to customer dissatisfaction 
the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our systems is critical to our success 
our operations depend on our ability to protect these systems against damage from fire  power loss  water  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  viruses  vandalism and other malicious acts and similar unexpected adverse events 
customers and prospective home buyers and sellers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them 
our services substantially depend on systems provided by third parties  over whom we have little control 
interruptions in our services could result from the failure of telecommunications providers and other third parties to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time frame required 
our operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  located at our headquarters in kirkland  washington and at co location facilities operated by third parties 
we depend on these third party providers of internet communication services to provide continuous and uninterrupted service 
we also depend on internet service providers that provide access to our services 
any disruption in the internet access provided by third party providers or any failure of third party providers to handle higher volumes of user traffic could harm our business 
our customers  our reputation and our products may be harmed by security breaches 
unauthorized computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security from time to time 
a hacker who penetrates our network security could misappropriate personal information about our customers  proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by hackers 
we also may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security 
in addition to purposeful security breaches  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our systems and harm our business 

table of contents several payment card brands and an independent standards body have adopted security standards  compliance with which is required of all merchants and service providers that process  transmit or store certain types of personal information pertaining to credit card holders 
if market leader fails to comply with these standards  it could be subject to fines and its ability to accept some or all credit cards could be restricted or suspended 
any such suspension or restriction would significantly affect our ability to collect fees from our customers  many of whom pay with a credit card 
this would result in harm to our business 
additionally  the majority of states and various federal regulatory bodies now require companies that maintain personal information about consumers to notify those consumers in the event of a breach of security in which certain types of personal information relating to those consumers is  or is suspected to have been  obtained by an unauthorized person 
these laws vary in their scope and requirements  and some of them also require notice to governmental agencies and other third parties 
in addition  other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported 
if we are required to disclose a security breach to consumers or other third parties  our business and reputation could be harmed 
if we do not have access to additional funds on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue to expand our business or service offerings 
to pursue our current and future business plans  we may choose to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
recently  the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain financing and may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for future strategic initiatives  operations or capital expenditures 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders would be reduced and these securities might have rights superior to those of our common stock 
item b unresolved staff comments none item properties we lease approximately  square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in kirkland  washington 
the lease commenced in december and has a six year term with defined periodic escalations 
this initial lease term expires in with an option for a five year renewal 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of our business  including actions relating to employment issues

overview market leader provides real estate professionals with the tools and services they need to manage and grow their real estate businesses 
we have been an innovator in internet based marketing services for real estate professionals since the company s inception in we recently began to shift our business model from its original lead generation model and toward offerings that combine software as a service with access to industry leading media buying and lead generation services 
traditional lead generation products continued to account for the majority of customer relationships and revenue in in november we introduced growth leader  a personalized website and proprietary customer relationship management tool for real estate agents  as well as a related product for agent teams  team leader 
together with realtygenerator  a turnkey lead generation and lead management system for real estate brokerage companies that we acquired in  these product offerings constitute the new products that support the shift in our business model 
these products feature vision  a personalized website and proprietary customer relationship management tool for real estate agents  and include access to industry leading media buying and lead generation services to help them attract new clients and promote themselves throughout their community 
additionally  market leader provides consumers with free access to the information and tools they need throughout the home buying and selling process 
our nationwide consumer web sites include justlisted 
com  a service that notifies home buyers as soon as new homes hit the market  housevalues 
com  a service that provides home sellers with market valuations of their current homes  and homepages 
com  a real estate portal that enables consumers to see all the home listings in their area  view detailed neighborhood and school data  compare recent home sales  find local real estate agents  and find the value of their own homes 
our new family of products also provides consumers with free access to similar information through localized web sites that we operate on behalf of our real estate professional customers 
how we generate revenues we generate the majority of our revenues from the services we provide to real estate agents and brokers 
growth leader  team leader  and realty generator we charge real estate professionals a one time set up fee and a monthly fixed fee for services  which include a personalized web site  the vision crm tool  marketing materials  training and support 
we also generate revenue by placing online advertising for our real estate professional customers  to drive traffic and leads to their web site 
we acquired the realtygenerator product in november and launched the growth leader and team leader products in late 
table of contents housevalues we charge real estate agents a one time set up fee and a monthly fixed fee for a monthly bundle of exclusive leads on prospective home sellers  the market leader crm tool  training and coaching programs 
justlisted like the housevalues product  we charge real estate agents a one time set up fee and a monthly fixed fee for a monthly bundle of exclusive leads on prospective home buyers  the market leader crm tool  training and coaching programs 
homepages showcase we charged a monthly fixed fee for showcase  an online marketing subscription to real estate professionals that allowed them to feature selected listings on our homepages web site 
we generally provide our services under terms of a one year agreement that then continues on a month to month basis until terminated 
growth leader customers have the option of selecting agreements with a short term commitment and higher monthly fees 
all initial set up fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the estimated customer life or the life of the contract  whichever is longer 
the remainder of our revenue is derived from monthly fees for stand alone use of our market leader crm system  advertising income and other marketing services  sales of excess leads and traffic  and the collection of contract termination fees  none of which materially affects our operating results 
these sources of revenues in the aggregate were less than of our revenues for all annual periods presented in this annual report on form k 
our expenses the largest components of our expenses are personnel and marketing costs 
personnel expenses consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales people 
these expenses are categorized in our statements of operations based on each employee s principal function 
marketing expenses consist of programs designed to attract consumers to our web sites and to promote our services to potential customers  primarily residential real estate agents 
the largest component of our marketing expenses consists of advertising designed to increase the number of potential home buyers and sellers who visit our web sites 
the impact of seasonality and cyclicality the residential real estate and advertising markets are influenced by seasonality as well as overall economic cycles 
seasonality while individual geographic markets vary  real estate transaction activity tends to progressively increase from january through the summer months  and then gradually slows over the last quarter of the calendar year 
as a result  we may experience slower lead generation and customer adoption toward the end of the year 
we are also subject to seasonal fluctuations in advertising rates and lead generation 
television advertising costs are generally more expensive in the second and fourth calendar quarters in connection with network premieres and finales and the holiday season 
cyclicality the success of our business depends on the health of the residential real estate market  which historically has been subject to economic cycles 
following a period of sustained growth  the residential real estate market has entered a down cycle 
housing prices have declined and residential real estate transactions have slowed significantly in major markets that are important to our business 

table of contents typically  during downturns in housing markets  demand for residential real estate decreases and demand for the services of real estate professionals similarly decreases 
in these markets  the number of real estate professionals may decline significantly as less successful agents and brokers leave the profession and fewer people seek to become real estate professionals 
a decline in the number of customers or a decrease in the amount they wish to spend on services such as ours will negatively impact our revenue and increase our customer acquisition costs 
in addition  the decline in the demand for housing could increase our lead generation costs and adversely impact our margins 
trends in the real estate market are unpredictable  therefore our operating results  to the extent they reflect changes in the broader real estate industry  may be subject to significant fluctuation 
current year overview revenue from continuing operations was million for the year  a decline compared to revenue decreased in due primarily to a decrease in average customer count and a decrease in average revenue per customer 
the related declines in revenue were partially offset by the addition of realtygenerator revenues which were million in compared to million in we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year compared to net loss from continuing operations of million in our net loss from continuing operations in includes noncash charges of million related to the full impairment of goodwill and million related to the other than temporary impairment of our investment in activerain 
our net loss from continuing operations in includes noncash charges of million related to our write down of goodwill and long lived assets and million related to the application of a full valuation allowance to our net deferred tax assets 
these charges in and reflect our history of operating losses  difficult market conditions in the residential real estate market that impacts our near term forecasted operations and cash flows  and the decline in our stock price 
see further discussion of these items in note   and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our operating results for the year continue to reflect the broader real estate market conditions  which remain challenging and we expect will be further affected by crisis conditions in the global banking  credit and mortgage lending markets 
we believe these broader economic trends negatively impact consumers ability and willingness to engage in real estate transactions  the commissions earned by real estate professionals  and the marketing investments that they are able and willing to make 
over the past several quarters  we have adapted to changing market conditions by better aligning expenses with expected revenue in an effort to avoid non strategic use of cash 
we believe that selective acquisitions  share repurchases and continued investments in our business can all potentially be strategic uses of cash 
because we cannot be certain of the depth and duration of the downturn amid the unprecedented economic uncertainty we are facing in at least the near term  we believe that cash has significant option value  and preserving that value will continue to be prudent until we have greater visibility in the economy and our business 
that said  we believe that the potential benefits of investment in the business have been enhanced by our recent introduction of innovative products  and we expect to gain share of mind and market by beginning to present our new solutions ahead of the inflection point of the real estate industry downturn 
significant business developments the following significant business developments affect the comparability of our financial statements purchase of realty generator 
on november   we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realty generator  llc and a related entity for approximately million in cash and assumed liabilities  including incentives based on the post acquisition performance of the acquired assets 
we accounted for this acquisition as a business combination and have included realty generator s results of operations from the transaction date forward 

table of contents investment in activerain 
on november   we acquired of the outstanding voting stock of activerain real estate network for million 
during september activerain s redemption of founder shares increased our ownership percentage to 
activerain is a professional community and social networking platform serving the real estate community 
activerain has grown its membership over the past two years to more than  real estate professionals 
our investment in activerain is recorded using the equity method of accounting which requires that we record our proportionate share of their net loss adjusted for any difference between our cost and the underlying equity in their net assets at the acquisition date 
as broader market conditions have contributed to the decline in our revenue  we have taken a series of actions since january to significantly reduce our cost structure to align with our revenue trends 
reduction in workforce 
in january  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
we recorded cash severance charges of approximately million and additional accelerated vesting charges of million related to equity compensation in the first quarter of closure of the yakima facility 
on july   we implemented a plan to reduce operating expenses  including the closure of our yakima  washington satellite center 
in connection with this plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
in the third quarter of  we recorded severance and related charges of million 
at the same time  we recognized an impairment charge of million to reduce the yakima leasehold improvements to their estimated fair value less estimated selling costs 
in january  we terminated our lease for the yakima facility and in a related transaction  assigned our purchase option for the yakima facility and its remaining assets to a third party for net cash of million 
we recorded a gain of million on this transaction in the first quarter of discontinued mortgage operations 
in january  we announced our exit from the mortgage lead generation business and our intention to scale back or eliminate initiatives that were not critical to our real estate agent customers 
these activities resulted in an overall reduction of our workforce by approximately employees 
in connection with the discontinuation of our mortgage operations and the reduction in workforce  we paid payroll and related costs of approximately million in and incurred accelerated stock compensation expense estimated of approximately million 
results of operations our discussion of operating results addresses results from continuing operations 
our former mortgage business is presented in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
the following table presents our historical operating results for continuing operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues expenses sales and marketing technology and product development general and administrative gain on sale of fixed assets impairment of goodwill and long lived assets depreciation and amortization of property and equipment amortization of acquired intangible assets total expenses loss income from continuing operations equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary interest income and expense  net income tax expense net loss income from continuing operations 
table of contents comparison of years ended december  and december  revenues years ended december  decrease percent change dollars in thousands revenues revenues decreased from last year 
our average customer count decreased by and our average revenue per customer declined by 
the cyclical downturn in the real estate industry  reflected in significant declines in existing home sales as well as housing prices over the past two years  has caused double digit declines in the total amount of real estate commissions earned for the third year in a row according to real trends 
we believe this downturn has negatively impacted the ability of real estate professionals to pay for marketing services and other lead generation costs  which has resulted in lower customer acquisition this year and a continued decline in our customer base 
we nonetheless improved our customer retention rates in compared to rates by working with customers to manage  and in many cases  reduce their monthly marketing commitment  which has resulted in lower average revenue per customer 
the revenue decline was partially offset by the increased contribution from our realtygenerator product revenue which was million in and million for the two months that we had the product in consistent with our goal of growing the product revenue  we added sales resources dedicated to realtygenerator in  and despite difficult market conditions  increased revenue from this product by in compared to the pro forma full year revenue amount of million in more detailed information about the sequential change in customers and average revenue per customer is included in the key operational metrics section of management s discussion and analysis 
in  we anticipate that revenues from our new vision family of products realtygenerator  team leader and growth leader will become an increasing part of our revenue base 
based on our experience with the realtygenerator product  we believe these additional product offerings will help us to achieve better customer retention rates and improved operating results over time 
however  we expect the ongoing challenges in the real estate market  as well as the broader negative economic trends will continue to impact real estate professionals and their ability to fund marketing expenditures 
therefore  we expect our current revenue trend to continue for at least the first half of given the expected shift in our product mix and lower customer base  we expect that the quarterly declines will moderate later in the year and this will create an opportunity for us to build on this baseline and return the business to growth as economic conditions improve 
sales and marketing years ended december  decrease percent change dollars in thousands sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and television advertising  as well as salaries  commissions and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff 
other expenses include credit card fees and corporate marketing and communications expenses 
sales and marketing expense decreased in absolute dollars and decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue during when compared to  primarily due to reduced advertising costs lead and traffic generation 
table of contents costs  as well as a reduction in payroll and related costs 
the decrease in advertising costs was consistent with our decrease in revenues and remained consistent as a percentage of revenue in compared to payroll and related costs decreased in due to decreased average headcount  as we realigned our cost structure to our projected revenues 
sales and marketing headcount decreased to at december   which compares to at december  in  we expect sales and marketing expense to decrease due to a lower advertising expense consistent with reduced revenue and because of lower average staffing levels compared to given the expected shift in our product mix to our vision based products  we anticipate advertising costs will become an increased percentage of revenue  driving an overall increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue during technology and product development years ended december  decrease percent change dollars in thousands technology and product development expense technology and product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for employees responsible for customer and internal technology services 
also included are license fees  maintenance costs  internet and phone connectivity and hosting costs 
technology and product development expense decreased in absolute dollars for as compared to  as we reduced the number of employees to bring our cost structure into alignment with our decreasing revenues 
in addition  communications and connectivity expenses decreased due to the closure of yakima office during technology and product development headcount decreased to at december   which compares to at december  despite the decline in absolute dollars  these costs increased as a percentage of revenue due to the year over year decline in revenues 
in  we expect the level of technology and product development costs to remain fairly consistent with the quarterly average in  but to increase as a percentage of lower revenue  as we continue to build out the infrastructure and enhance our new vision based products and to develop new product offerings on the vision platform 
general and administrative years ended december  decrease percent change dollars in thousands general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  accounting  and human resources personnel 
these costs also include audit and legal fees  business consulting fees  business insurance premiums  rent and related expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased as we reduced the number of employees and reduced other expenses such as facility costs  recruiting and business insurance to bring our cost structure into alignment with our decreasing revenues 
despite the decline in absolute dollars  these costs increased as a percentage of revenue due to the year over year decline in revenues 
headcount decreased to at december  from at december  
table of contents in  we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease modestly in total dollars as we manage operational costs  but to increase as a percentage of revenue on lower expected revenues 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets based on our history of operating losses and the decline in the economy and in the market value of our common stock  we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill and long lived assets and assessed potential impairment using market prices and other available information 
as a result we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
during  we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill and long lived assets and assessed potential impairment using similar market information as in as a result we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million and an impairment charge of million related to other long lived assets 
in addition  during the year we determined that certain internally developed software projects had limited future benefits  resulting in impairment charges totaling million 
in july  we closed our satellite sales and service center in yakima  washington  and recognized an impairment charge of million to reduce the related leasehold improvements to their estimated fair value less selling costs 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment depreciation and amortization of property and equipment decreased year over year primarily due to the lower asset values resulting from impairment charges taken against our capital assets during and the closure of our yakima facility during the third quarter of we expect a net decrease in depreciation expense in because a portion of our asset base becomes fully depreciated  which is expected to more than offset depreciation for new additions 
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased for when compared to  due to the new intangible assets related to the realty generator acquisition in the fourth quarter of equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary our equity in the losses of activerain increased in when compared to  primarily due to the partial year of ownership in  as well as an impairment charge of million that was recorded in the other than temporary impairment was the result of an evaluation of the estimated fair value of our investment at december  that indicated a fair value that was less than its carrying value  and that the impairment was other than temporary 
interest income and expense  net interest income decreased in when compared to due to decreased rates of return on investments as well as a reduction in the amount of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments held 
early in  we modified our investment strategy to preserve the security and liquidity of our funds  which has resulted in significantly lower rates of return 
at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  
table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations was essentially nil for  compared to for our effective tax rate was negative in due to our establishment of a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets at december  substantially all of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse over the next five years  except for the net operating losses 
we believe that based on the decline in the national real estate market  our recent history of operating losses and the lack of carryback periods  it is more likely than not that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against our deferred tax assets

one minus our average monthly churn rate equates to our average monthly retention rate 
average monthly customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of customers who canceled during the quarter by the average customers in the quarter  divided by the number of months in the quarter 
other companies may calculate churn and retention differently  and their churn and retention data may not be directly comparable to ours 
average real estate professional customers in the quarter are calculated as the average of customers at the beginning and at the end of the quarter 
average monthly revenue per customer is calculated as real estate professional revenue for the quarter divided by the average number of customers in the quarter 
on a sequential quarter basis  our customer count decreased by  customers during the fourth quarter of  compared to a decrease of customers in the third quarter of for the fourth quarter of  the number of cancelling customers increased slightly and customer additions decreased 
ending customers at december  decreased compared to december  it continued to be a challenging real estate market in the fourth quarter of  which has been further complicated by broader economic conditions 
we believe this trend impacts the investment in marketing that real estate professionals are willing to make  resulting in a slowing of new sales  as well as the possibility of lower retention rates 
the average monthly retention rate for our customers was for the fourth quarter of  a lower rate than the third quarter of that we believe was driven by significant deterioration in the financial and credit markets 
due to the continued volatility of the real estate market and broader economic concerns  we expect to experience fluctuations in our customer retention rate from quarter to quarter 
average monthly revenue per customer for the fourth quarter of decreased compared to the third quarter of primarily as a result of customers reducing their spend  as well as pricing adjustments made in response to the current market conditions 
average revenue per customer will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the mix of sales for products priced differently across lower and higher priced geographies  the demand for existing services and the acceptance of new product offerings

future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our revenue trend  the level of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  and the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products  services or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future 
we may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to the extent necessary to fund such activities 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the policies and estimates we feel are critical 
business combinations  intangible assets  and goodwill valuation when acquired 
we account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of acquisition 
significant judgment is used to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives and other assumptions 
in our acquisition of the assets of realty generator  we determined the fair value of various identifiable intangible assets  including trade name  customer lists and developed technology 
we used factors such as market prices for similar assets and revenue estimates of customers acquired  adjusted for assumed attrition rates and estimated costs that would be incurred to generate revenue using the acquired developed technology and other assets 
our estimates of revenue and costs were based on historical data  internal estimates and a variety of external sources 
we record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired less the liabilities assumed 
in the acquisition of realty generator  we recorded goodwill at the time of acquisition  and increased our goodwill in based on the additional incentives earned based on the earnings of the acquired assets  as defined 
ongoing reporting and impairment testing 
our intangible assets  other than goodwill  and other long lived assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
further  we are required to evaluate goodwill annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we conduct our annual test for impairment in the fourth quarter 
the assessment of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill requires significant judgment to determine the number of reporting units  to estimate future cash flows  to use appropriate market value factors  to estimate the related asset lives and other assumptions as noted below 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the fair value determination and potential goodwill impairment 

table of contents results of impairment tests 
we continue to face challenging real estate market conditions  which have been further impacted by the broader economic downturn 
when the economic climate combined with a decline in our stock price at the end of the third quarter  we evaluated our goodwill for impairment  ahead of our normal timing for the annual test 
at that time we determined there was no impairment 
we also evaluated our long lived assets for impairment  and consistent with the outcome of our goodwill assessment  determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
based on continued difficult economic conditions  further significant decline in our stock price and other factors  we again evaluated goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of as a result  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million  representing a write off of the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill 
we also evaluated our long lived assets for impairment and determined that we did not have an impairment charge related to our long lived assets 
our impairment analyses for goodwill were dependent on many variables 
we determined the fair value of our net assets based on a combination of market and income approaches 
key assumptions used in the market approaches included the determination that we have a single reporting unit  the appropriate stock price to determine market value  use of control premium and determination of the appropriate control premium  determination of an appropriate set of comparable companies 
key assumptions in the income approach was based on a discounted case model  which included significant assumptions about our future revenues  expenses  target profitability rates  and determination of an appropriate discount rate 
due to current market conditions  greater weighting was attributed to the market approaches  which were weighted while the income approach was weighted in arriving at our determination of the fair value of our net assets 
our impairment analyses for our long lived assets other than goodwill included a number of key variables  included estimated future cash flows 
we determined the fair value of our long lived assets based on several key assumptions  including the determination that we have a single asset grouping  references to quoted market prices for similar assets  estimates of replacement cost  as well as assumptions about our future revenues  expenses  target profitability rates  and determination of an appropriate discount rate 
the complexities of the analyses used to assess impairment of our goodwill and long lived assets do not permit a simplistic determination of the impact of changes in assumptions 
we believe one of the most significant impacts of a change in the assumptions used in determining our goodwill impairment as of september  and december   related to our determination that we operate a single reporting unit 
if we had determined that there were two or more reporting units  we may have determined that there had been an impairment of goodwill at september   or that there had been less than a full impairment charge to our goodwill as of december  this discussion is not intended to address all potential outcomes that could have resulted if we had used different assumptions to determine impairment of our goodwill and other long lived assets given the number of assumptions used to make those determinations and the degree of sensitivity in the determination of fair value of the company and our assets and liabilities 
although we have no goodwill remaining  we continue to carry approximately million of long lived assets as of december   and while we continue to depreciate these assets  at the same time  we continue to capitalize costs related to internally generated software and may acquire other capital assets 
factors that may require future assessments of impairment of our long lived assets include  among others  deterioration of our estimate of future cash flows or lower customer retention rates than projected 
in  we assessed the realizability of our goodwill and other long lived assets based on our history of operating losses and the decline in the market value of our stock  particularly in the fourth quarter of as a result of these analyses  we recorded impairment charges totaling million related to goodwill and other long lived assets in 
table of contents in  we assessed the realizability of assets related to the mortgage segment 
as a result of the deterioration of projected future cash flows for our mortgage segment  we recorded an impairment charge of million in related to the intangible assets and goodwill from the loan page acquisition 
management made a formal decision to exit the mortgage lead generation business in january minority investment in unconsolidated subsidiary valuation when acquired 
we paid million for a minority interest in activerain real estate network during as there was a difference of million between our cost and our share of the underlying equity in activerain s net assets  we were required to apply purchase accounting methodology to identify intangible assets and goodwill acquired 
significant judgment was used to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives and other assumptions 
we identified and assigned values to in process research and development  developed technology  trade name and member base  in addition to goodwill 
ongoing reporting and impairment testing 
as our investment represents an ownership interest of  a significant ownership interest  we apply the equity method of accounting 
therefore our investment represents our original investment and our proportionate share of their net loss  as adjusted for the impact of amortization or impairment of the identified intangible assets and goodwill 
results of impairment tests 
our investment must also be periodically reviewed to determine whether the value of the investment may be impaired on an other than temporary basis 
the determination of the fair value of this asset is dependent on material judgment and estimates  which as activerain is a privately held company are based primarily on the income approach using management s estimates of future cash flows 
this analysis therefore includes the same significant assumptions used when we recorded our initial investment in activerain  as well as the determination that impairment is other than temporary 
our assessment of other than temporary impairment for our activerain investment as of december  resulted in an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our investment to our estimate of fair value  million 
the effect of a change to the most significant variable  estimated future cash flows  would have changed our impairment charge by approximately k 
we expect to continue to record our proportionate share of activerain s net losses in  and do not expect to record future impairment losses in the near term due to the decreased carrying value of our investment 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss carryforwards in our existing business and related to acquisitions 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the provision for income taxes and the related current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates must take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits 
changes in the amount of our tax exempt income  increases in operating losses  changes in the tax laws or our interpretation of the tax laws and the resolution of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes and the amount of valuation allowances required in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we have net deferred tax assets of million  before reduction for our valuation allowance 
we considered all available evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance was required for those assets  including the following factors estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable 
table of contents temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years as permitted under tax law  historical taxable income  normalized for non recurring items  expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on our current projections of future operating profits  we continue to believe that it is not likely that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets and continue to maintain a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets at december  stock based compensation we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation related to option grants using the black scholes pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including estimating the stock option expected life and stock price volatility 
changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of options granted 
the following table illustrates the effect of changing these significant variables on the estimated fair value of our options 
the following examples are hypothetical but representative of our option grants and their related fair values at december  in each analysis  the remaining variables are held constant

the primary items that would be affected by the remaining provisions of sfas are our goodwill impairment and long lived asset impairment tests
