executive summary metlife is a leading provider of individual insurance  employee benefits and financial services with operations throughout the united states and the regions of latin america  europe  and asia pacific 
through its subsidiaries and affiliates  metlife offers life insurance  annuities  automobile and homeowners insurance  retail banking and other financial services to individuals  as well as group insurance and retirement savings products and services to corporations and other institutions 
subsequent to the disposition of reinsurance group of america  incorporated rga and the elimination of the reinsurance segment  metlife is organized into four operating segments institutional  individual  auto home and international  as well as corporate other 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company reported  million in net income available to common shareholders and net income per diluted common share of for the year ended december  compared to  million in net income available to common shareholders and net income per diluted common share of for the year ended december  net income available to common shareholders decreased by  million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in net income available to common shareholders was principally due to an increase in losses from discontinued operations of million 
this was primarily the result of the split off of substantially all of the company s interest in rga in september whereby stockholders of the company were offered the opportunity to exchange their shares of metlife  inc common stock for shares of rga class b common stock based upon a pre determined exchange ratio 
the decrease in net income available to common shareholders was also driven by an increase in other expenses of million  net of income tax 
the increase in other expenses was due to higher dac amortization in the individual segment related to lower expected future gross profits due to separate account balance decreases resulting from recent market declines  higher net investment gains primarily due to net derivative gains and the reduction on expected cumulative earnings of the closed block partially offset by a reduction in actual earnings of the closed block and changes in assumptions used to estimate future gross profits and margins 
in addition  there is further offset in the institutional segment due to a charge associated with the adoption of sop in the prior year 
an increase in corporate expenses primarily related to an enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative 
as a result of a strategic review begun in  the company launched an enterprise 
table of contents initiative called operational excellence 
this initiative began in april and management expects the initiative to be fully implemented by december  this initiative is focused on reducing complexity  leveraging scale  increasing productivity  improving the effectiveness of the company s operations and providing a foundation for future growth 
the company recognized within corporate other during the current period an initial accrual for post employment related expenses 
higher legal costs in corporate other principally driven by costs associated with the commutation of three asbestos insurance policies and higher expenses in the institutional and international segments as well as corporate other associated with business growth and higher corporate support expenses 
higher expenses in corporate other relating to increased compensation  rent  and mortgage loan origination costs and servicing expenses associated with two acquisitions by metlife bank in premiums  fees and other revenues increased by  million  net of income tax  across all of the company s operating segments but most notably within the institutional and international segments due to business growth 
policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends increased commensurately by  million  net of income tax  however  policyholder benefits and claims were also adversely impacted by an increase in catastrophe losses in the auto home segment  a charge within the institutional segment resulting from a liability adjustment in the group annuity business  and business growth 
net investment losses decreased by  million  net of income tax  to a gain of  million  net of income tax  for the year ended december  from a loss of million  net of income tax  for the comparable period 
the decrease in net investment losses is due to an increase in gains on derivatives partially offset by losses primarily on fixed maturity and equity securities 
derivative gains were driven by gains on freestanding derivatives that were partially offset by losses on embedded derivatives primarily associated with variable annuity riders 
gains on freestanding derivatives increased by  million  net of income tax  and were primarily driven by i gains on certain interest rate swaps  floors and swaptions which were economic hedges of certain investment assets and liabilities  ii gains from foreign currency derivatives primarily due to the us dollar strengthening as well as  iii gains primarily from equity options  financial futures  and interest rate swaps hedging the embedded derivatives 
the gains on these equity options  financial futures  and interest rate swaps substantially offset the change in the underlying embedded derivative liability that is hedged by these derivatives 
losses on the embedded derivatives increased by  million  net of income tax  and were driven by declining interest rates and poor equity market performance throughout the year 
these embedded derivative losses include a  million  net of income tax  gain resulting from the effect of the widening of the company s own credit spread which is required to be used in the valuation of these variable annuity rider embedded derivatives under sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which became effective january  the remaining change in net investment losses of  million  net of income tax  is principally attributable to an increase in losses on fixed maturity and equity securities  and  to a lesser degree  an increase in losses on mortgage and consumer loans and other limited partnerships offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction gains 
the increase in losses on fixed maturity and equity securities is primarily attributable to an increase in impairments associated with financial services industry holdings which experienced losses as a result of bankruptcies  fdic receivership  and federal government assisted capital infusion transactions in the third and fourth quarters of losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were also driven by an increase in credit related impairments on communication and consumer sector security holdings  losses on asset backed securities as well as an increase in losses on fixed maturity security holdings where the company either lacked the intent to hold  or due to extensive credit widening  the company was uncertain of its intent to hold these fixed maturity securities for a period of time sufficient to allow recovery of the market value decline 
net investment income decreased by  million  or  net of income tax  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
management attributes  million  net of income tax  of this change to a decrease in yields  partially offset by an increase of million due to growth in average invested assets 
average invested assets are calculated on a cost basis without unrealized gains and losses 
the decrease in net investment income attributable to lower yields was primarily due to lower returns on other limited partnership interests  real estate joint ventures  short term investments  fixed maturity securities  and mortgage loans  partially offset by improved securities lending results 
management anticipates that 
table of contents the significant volatility in the equity  real estate and credit markets will continue in which could continue to impact net investment income and yields on other limited partnerships and real estate joint ventures 
net investment income increased due to an increase in average invested assets  on an amortized cost basis  primarily within short term investments  other invested assets including derivatives  mortgage loans  other limited partnership interests  and real estate joint ventures 
a decrease in interest credited to policyholder account balances of million  net of income tax  resulted from a decline in average crediting rates  which was largely due to the impact of lower short term interest rates in the current period  offset by an increase from growth in the average policyholder account balance  primarily the result of continued growth in the global gic and funding agreement products all of which occurred within the institutional segment 
there was also a decrease in interest credited in the international segment as a result of a reduction in unit linked policyholder liabilities reflecting the losses of the trading portfolio backing these liabilities 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company reported  million in net income available to common shareholders and earnings per diluted common share of for the year ended december  compared to  million in net income available to common shareholders and earnings per diluted common share of for the year ended december  net income available to common shareholders decreased by  million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the period 
the decrease in net income available to common shareholders was primarily due to a decrease in income from discontinued operations of  million  net of income tax 
this decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally driven by a gain on the sale of the peter cooper village and stuyvesant town properties in manhattan  new york  that was recognized during the year ended december  also contributing to the decrease was lower net investment income and net investment gains losses from discontinued operations related to real estate properties sold or held for sale during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  lower income from discontinued operations related to the sale of metlife insurance limited metlife australia annuities and pension businesses to a third party in the third quarter of and lower income from discontinued operations related to the sale of ssrm holdings  inc ssrm resulting from a reduction in additional proceeds from the sale received during the year ended december  as compared to the year december  this decrease was partially offset by higher income from discontinued operations related to rga  which was reclassified to discontinued operations in the third quarter of as a result of a tax free split off 
rga s income was higher in  primarily due to an increase in premiums  net of an increase in policyholder benefits and claims  due to additional in force business from facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business combined with an increase in net investment income  net of interest credited to policyholder account balances  due to higher invested assets 
these increases in rga s income were offset by an increase in net investment losses resulting from a decline in the estimated fair value of embedded derivatives associated with the reinsurance of annuity products on a funds withheld basis 
the decrease in net income available to common shareholders was also driven by an increase in other expenses of million  net of income tax 
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac resulting from business growth  lower net investment losses in the current year and the net impact of revisions to management s assumption used to determine estimated gross profits and margins in both years 
in addition  other expenses increased due to higher compensation  higher interest expense on debt and interest on tax contingencies  the net impact of revisions to certain liabilities in both periods  asset write offs  higher general spending and expenses related to growth initiatives  partially offset by lower legal costs and integration costs incurred in the net effect of increases in premiums  fees and other revenues of  million  net of income tax  across all of the company s operating segments and increases in policyholder benefit and claims and policyholder dividends of million  net of income tax  was attributable to overall business growth and increased net income available to common shareholders 

table of contents net investment income increased by  million  net of income tax  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
management attributes million of this increase to growth in the average asset base and million to an increase in yields 
growth in the average asset base was primarily within fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests 
higher yields was primarily due to higher returns on fixed maturity securities  other limited partnership interests excluding hedge funds  equity securities and improved securities lending results  partially offset by lower returns on real estate joint ventures  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  hedge funds and mortgage loans 
net investment losses decreased by million to a loss of million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the comparable period 
the decrease in net investment losses was primarily due to a reduction of losses on fixed maturity securities resulting principally from the portfolio repositioning in a rising interest rate environment  increased gains from asset based foreign currency transactions due to a decline in the us dollar year over year against several major currencies and increased gains on equity securities  partially offset by increased losses from the mark to market on derivatives and reduced gains on real estate and real estate joint ventures 
an increase in interest credited to policyholder account balances associated with an increase in the average policyholder account balance decreased net income available to common shareholders by million  net of income tax 
the remainder of the variance is due to the change in effective tax rates between periods 
consolidated company outlook the marketplace is still reacting and adapting to the unusual economic events that took place over the past year and management expects the volatility in the financial markets to continue in as a result  management expects a modest increase  on a constant exchange rate basis  in premiums  fees and other revenues in  with mixed results across the various businesses 
while the company continues to gain market share in a number of product lines  premiums  fees and other revenues have and may continue to be impacted by the us and global recession  which may be reflected by  but is not limited to lower fee income from separate account businesses  including variable annuity and life products in individual business 
a potential reduction in payroll linked revenue from institutional group insurance customers 
a decline in demand for certain international and institutional retirement savings products 
a decrease in auto home premiums resulting from a depressed housing market and auto industry 
with the expectation of the turbulent financial markets continuing in  management expects continued downward pressure on net income  specifically net investment income  as management expects lower returns from other limited partnerships  real estate joint ventures  and securities lending 
in addition  the resulting impact of the financial markets on net investment gains losses and unrealized investment gains losses can and will vary greatly and therefore  it is difficult to predict 
also difficult to determine is the impact of own credit  as it varies significantly and this exposure is not hedged 
certain insurance related liabilities  specifically those associated with guarantees  are tied to market performance  which in times of depressed investment markets may require management to establish additional liabilities 
however  many of the risks associated with these guarantees are hedged 
the turbulent financial markets  sustained over a period of time  may also necessitate management to strengthen insurance liabilities that are not associated with guarantees 
management does not anticipate significant changes in the underlying trends that drive underwriting results  with the possible exception of certain trends in the auto home and disability businesses 
certain expenses may increase due to initiatives such as operational excellence 
other charges are also possible as the combination of the downward pressure on net income coupled with the expectations of the financial markets  may necessitate a review of goodwill impairment  specifically within the individual business 
the unusual 
table of contents financial market conditions will also likely cause an increase in the company s pension related expense and may cause an increase in dac amortization 
in response to the challenges presented by the unusual economic environment  management continues to focus on disciplined underwriting  pricing  hedging strategies  as well as focused expense management 
institutional business outlook management expects continued growth in premium  fees  and other revenues across the majority of the institutional businesses 
revenues in many of the businesses can fluctuate based  in part  on the covered payroll of customers or changes in the amount of coverage they have purchased for current or former employees 
as a result  in periods of high unemployment  revenue may be impacted 
revenue may also be negatively impacted as a result of customers reduction of coverage stemming from benefit plan changes  the elimination of retiree coverage or customer related bankruptcies 
revenues in the retirement savings business may experience some pressure as the demand for certain of these products can decline during periods of volatile credit and investment markets 
with the expectation of the turbulent financial markets continuing in  management expects to see lower earnings resulting from depressed levels of net investment income  specifically as previously discussed in the consolidated outlook  which will put downward pressure on earnings from interest margins in the spread related businesses 
if there is an extended period of sustained  low long term market interest rates  it is possible that strengthening certain long term liabilities could be necessary 
management does not expect to see significant changes in the underlying trends that drive underwriting results  with the possible exception of the disability business 
management thinks the level of disability claims is correlated to the unemployment rate and therefore underwriting results in this business may be impacted if the recession continues to deepen and there is a continued rise in the unemployment rate 
in  management will continue to focus on disciplined underwriting  pricing and aggressively managing expenses  while making deliberate investments in certain areas that management expects will create long term growth opportunities 
the unusual financial market conditions previously mentioned  will also likely cause an increase in the company s pension related expense 
individual business outlook management expects premium  fees and other revenues to be down slightly compared to results 
individual business experienced a significant decline in asset based fees in annuity and variable life products in the second half of due to equity market declines 
this depressed level of fee revenue is expected to continue in however  individual business experienced a significant increase in fourth quarter fixed annuity sales  which management believes was partially the result of consumers recognizing the strength of metlife s guarantees 
while management believes fixed annuity sales will continue to be strong  future sales of all products could be impacted as the financial services industry adjusts to the economic environment and as anticipated industry consolidation occurs 
management believes the investment and capital markets may continue to be turbulent in  which would continue to exert downward pressure on net income  specifically net investment income as previously discussed in the consolidated outlook 
certain annuity and life benefit guarantees are tied to market performance  which in times of depressed investment markets  may require management to establish additional liabilities 
however  many of the risks associated with these guarantees are hedged 
these pressures might result in potential modifications to product pricing strategies associated with acceptable returns for the underlying risks being covered 
other charges are also possible as the combination of the downward pressure on net income coupled with the expectations of the financial markets  may necessitate a review of goodwill impairment 
the unusual financial market conditions will also likely cause an increase in the company s pension related expense and may cause an increase in dac amortization 

table of contents management believes that its disciplined approach to underwriting  pricing  hedging and investment strategies will further strengthen metlife s industry leadership position and mitigate the impacts from the ongoing uncertainty in the investment markets 
additionally  management continues to focus on expense management by driving efficiency and productivity gains within the distribution and home office organizations 
international business outlook although management expects that premiums  fees and other revenues  on a constant exchange rate basis  will continue to increase across the regions in  there is a risk of lower product demand as well as higher policy surrenders if the trend of higher unemployment  decreased individual income levels  and lower corporate earnings continues in to address this  various distribution channels and customer service operations initiatives are being implemented to expand relationships with existing distributors  develop new channel outlets and improve persistency management 
in addition  market conditions have and may continue to cause an increase in the cost of related hedging programs and may result in a decrease in fee income from lower assets under management 
furthermore  the responses of governments and policymakers  in the countries in which the business operates  to the economic circumstances could have an unpredictable impact on results 
continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact reported premiums  fees and other revenues as well as net income 
management continues to evaluate strategies to mitigate this risk 
management expects continued turbulence in global capital markets during  which may create downward pressure on net income  specifically net investment income as previously discussed in the consolidated outlook 
in the asia region  certain annuity benefit guarantees are tied to market performance  which in times of depressed investment markets  may require management to establish additional liabilities 
this exposure may result in modifications to our product pricing strategies in order to maintain acceptable returns for the underwriting risks being covered 
the sufficiency of certain reserves in the asia region is sensitive to interest rates and other related assumptions 
adverse changes in key assumptions for interest rates  exchange rates  mortality and morbidity levels or lapse rates could lead to a need to strengthen reserves 
management continues to take a disciplined approach toward expense management  however  management will continue to invest in infrastructure and distribution improvements where such spending will enhance growth 
the unusual financial market conditions may cause an increase in dac amortization 
management believes that the ability to deliver quality risk protection and retirement savings products to the markets  coupled with the company s financial strength and strong risk management expertise  will help achieve continued growth in this challenging environment 
management continues to take a disciplined approach toward expense management 
operational excellence initiatives undertaken by management in and planned for will create expense efficiencies  however  management will continue to invest in infrastructure and distribution improvements where such spending will enhance growth 
management believes that the ability to deliver quality risk protection and retirement savings products to the markets  coupled with the company s financial strength and strong risk management expertise  will help achieve continued growth in this challenging environment 
auto home outlook management expects premiums for the auto home segment to grow slightly in the key sales triggers of new and existing home sales and auto sales dropped precipitously during  contributing to large declines in new homeowner and auto policies written during however  these declines began to slow late in new business sales are expected to rebound modestly for both auto and homeowners  assuming overall economic conditions improve  particularly as credit availability returns  and as a combination of various marketing and sales initiatives have been implemented 
retention ratios are expected to remain flat  or improve slightly  as specific underwriting initiatives to control exposures to catastrophe events were completed in the fourth quarter of net premiums written for are expected to increase modestly with slightly larger increases in auto premiums written and slightly smaller increases in homeowners and other 
a portion of this increase is expected to result from increases in exposures with the remaining change coming from increased average premium per policy 

table of contents net investment income is also expected to be slightly lower in  as previously discussed in the consolidated outlook  and cash from operations and maturing investments is reinvested at slightly lower rates 
in addition  management expects the expense ratio to decline slightly as management continues to manage operating expenses 
underwriting margins for both auto and homeowners are expected to remain under pressure as some carriers have been willing to accept higher combined ratios in an attempt to grow written premium 
auto results benefited primarily from lower severities during a reduction in miles driven  initially tied to higher gasoline prices and later in the year to the general economic slowdown  contributed to these improvements 
a continuation of the trend towards lower frequencies is expected for with higher severities expected to more than offset the gains from frequencies 
management believes this will result in a slightly higher loss and loss adjusting expense ratio for  compared to the same ratio for  excluding prior year loss development 
homeowner margins for  excluding catastrophes  were impacted by higher claims frequencies  primarily related to greater non catastrophe weather related losses  offset by lower severities 
in  a return to more normal weather patterns is expected and management believes will result in lower frequencies in partially offset by higher severities  resulting in a small expected drop in the homeowner loss and loss adjusting ratio  excluding catastrophes  as compared to the unusual financial market conditions  previously discussed  will also likely cause an increase in the company s pension related expense 
management continues to aggressively look for ways to control costs in all other areas so it may maintain an appropriate expense ratio 
corporate other outlook management believes the investment and capital markets may continue to be turbulent in  which would continue to exert downward pressure on net investment income  as previously discussed in the consolidated outlook  and earnings on excess surplus equity 
management expects that investment income could be adversely impacted by a continuation of increased liquidity levels due to the uncertain operating environment and lack of suitable investment opportunities current liquidity levels may position us to take advantage of any economic recovery  mitigating the impact that these levels have on net investment income 
management does not expect a significant increase in interest expense 
a portion of the company s debt has a variable interest rate and the associated interest expense will fluctuate with market rates 
however  this expense has a corresponding investment that is also tied to variable rates and therefore  generally should minimize the impact to net income 
in addition  settlements for asbestos claims and other potential legal claims may have an adverse impact on net income 
management expects that the metlife bank acquisitions completed in will be accretive to earnings with additional investment income and higher premiums  fees  and other income  partially offset with increased interest and operating expenses 
metlife bank could be impacted by changes in the residential loan market 
acquisitions and dispositions disposition of reinsurance group of america  incorporated on september   the company completed a tax free split off of its majority owned subsidiary  rga

financial and economic environment 
our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally  both in the united states and elsewhere around the world 
the stress experienced by global capital markets that began in the second half of has continued and substantially increased  since mid september  the global financial markets have experienced unprecedented disruption  adversely affecting the business environment in general  as well as the financial services industry  in particular 
there is consensus in the economic community that the us economy is in a recession 
throughout and continuing in  congress  the federal reserve bank of new york  the us treasury and other agencies of the federal government took a number of increasingly aggressive actions in addition to continuing a series of interest rate reductions that began in the second half of intended to provide liquidity to financial institutions and markets  to avert a loss of investor confidence in particular troubled institutions and to prevent or contain the spread of the financial crisis 
how and to whom the us treasury distributes amounts available under the governmental programs could have the effect of supporting some aspects of the financial services industry more than others or provide advantages to some of our competitors 
governments in many of the foreign markets in which metlife operates have also responded to address market imbalances and have taken meaningful steps intended to restore market confidence

table of contents demographics 
in the coming decade  a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry will be the rising income protection  wealth accumulation and needs of the retiring baby boomers 
as a result of increasing longevity  retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to finance retirements that may span or more years 
helping the baby boomers to accumulate assets for retirement and subsequently to convert these assets into retirement income represents an opportunity for the life insurance industry 
life insurers are well positioned to address the baby boomers rapidly increasing need for savings tools and for income protection 
the company believes that  among life insurers  those with strong brands  high financial strength ratings and broad distribution  are best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity to offer income protection products to baby boomers 
moreover  the life insurance industry s products and the needs they are designed to address are complex 
the company believes that individuals approaching retirement age will need to seek information to plan for and manage their retirements and that  in the workplace  as employees take greater responsibility for their benefit options and retirement planning  they will need information about their possible individual needs 
one of the challenges for the life insurance industry will be the delivery of this information in a cost effective manner 
competitive pressures 
the life insurance industry remains highly competitive 
the product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments  leading to more intense competition with respect to product features 
larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity  product development  technology and risk management  which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry 
in addition  several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition 
sufficient scale  financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry 
larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base 
we believe that the turbulence in financial markets that began in the latter half of  its impact on the capital position of many competitors  and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have highlighted financial strength as the most significant differentiator from the perspective of customers and certain distributors 
in addition  the financial market turbulence and the economic recession have led many companies in our industry to re examine the pricing and features of the products they offer and may lead to consolidation in the life insurance industry 
regulatory changes 
the life insurance industry is regulated at the state level  with some products and services also subject to federal regulation 
as life insurers introduce new and often more complex products  regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry 
regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the reserve and capital requirements of the industry 
in addition  regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products  including equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and group products 
we expect the regulation of the financial services industry to receive renewed scrutiny as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets in it is possible that significant regulatory reforms could be implemented 
we cannot predict whether any such reforms will be adopted  the form they will take or their effect upon us 
we also cannot predict how the various government responses to the current financial and economic difficulties will affect the financial services and insurance industries or the standing of particular companies  including our company  within those industries 
pension plans 
on august   president bush signed the pension protection act of ppa into law 
the ppa is a comprehensive reform of defined benefit and defined contribution plan rules 
the provisions of the ppa may  over time  have a significant impact on demand for pension  retirement savings  and lifestyle protection products in both the institutional and retail markets 
while the impact of the ppa is generally expected to be positive over time  these changes may have adverse short term effects on the company s business as plan sponsors may react to these changes in a variety of ways as the new rules and related regulations begin to take effect 
in response to the current financial and economic environment  president bush signed into the law the worker  retiree and employer recovery act the employer recovery act in december this act is intended to  among other things  ease the transition of certain funding requirements of the ppa for defined benefit plans 
the financial and economic environment and the enactment of the employer recovery act may delay the timing or change the nature of qualified plan sponsor actions and  in turn  affect the company s business 

table of contents summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining i the estimated fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values  ii investment impairments  iii the recognition of income on certain investment entities  iv the application of the consolidation rules to certain investments  v the existence and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  vi the estimated fair value of and accounting for derivatives  vii the capitalization and amortization of dac and the establishment and amortization of voba  viii the measurement of goodwill and related impairment  if any  ix the liability for future policyholder benefits  x accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets  xi accounting for reinsurance transactions  xii accounting for employee benefit plans  and xiii the liability for litigation and regulatory matters 
the application of purchase accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical estimates 
in applying the company s accounting policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
fair value as described below  certain assets and liabilities are measured at estimated fair value on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  these footnotes to the consolidated financial statements include disclosures of estimated fair values 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
in many cases  the exit price and the transaction or entry price will be the same at initial recognition 
however  in certain cases  the transaction price may not represent fair value 
under sfas  fair value of a liability is based on the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability to a third party with the same credit standing 
sfas requires that fair value be a market based measurement in which the fair value is determined based on a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant 
when quoted prices are not used to determine fair value  sfas requires consideration of three broad valuation techniques i the market approach  ii the income approach  and iii the cost approach 
the approaches are not new  but sfas requires that entities determine the most appropriate valuation technique to use  given what is being measured and the availability of sufficient inputs 
sfas prioritizes the inputs to fair valuation techniques and allows for the use of unobservable inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available 
the company has categorized its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three level hierarchy  based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
an asset 
table of contents or liability s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation 
sfas defines the input levels as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
the company defines active markets based on average trading volume for equity securities 
the size of the bid ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for fixed maturity securities 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in level  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the assets or liabilities 
unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of estimated fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
the measurement and disclosures under sfas in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes exclude certain items such as nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at estimated fair value in a business combination  reporting units measured at estimated fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test and indefinite lived intangible assets measured at estimated fair value for impairment assessment 
the effective date for these items was deferred to january  prior to adoption of sfas  estimated fair value was determined based solely upon the perspective of the reporting entity 
therefore  methodologies used to determine the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments prior to january   while being deemed appropriate under existing accounting guidance  may not have produced an exit value as defined in sfas estimated fair values of investments the company s investments in fixed maturity and equity securities  investments in trading securities  certain short term investments  most mortgage loans held for sale  and mortgage servicing rights msrs are reported at their estimated fair value 
in determining the estimated fair value of these investments  various methodologies  assumptions and inputs are utilized  as described further below 
when available  the estimated fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable 
generally  these are the most liquid of the company s securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management judgment 
when quoted prices in active markets are not available  the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies 
the market standard valuation methodologies utilized include discounted cash flow methodologies  matrix pricing or other similar techniques 
the assumptions and inputs in applying these market standard valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to interest rates  credit standing of the issuer or counterparty  industry sector of the issuer  coupon rate  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  maturity  estimated duration and management s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated fair values are based on available market information and management s judgments about financial instruments 
the significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
such observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active  liquid markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market 

table of contents when observable inputs are not available  the market standard valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value of certain types of securities that trade infrequently  and therefore have little or no price transparency  rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
these unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or estimation  and cannot be supported by reference to market activity 
even though unobservable  these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities 
the estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale are determined based on observable pricing of residential mortgage loans held for sale with similar characteristics  or observable pricing for securities backed by similar types of loans  adjusted to convert the securities prices to loan prices 
generally  quoted market prices are not available 
when observable pricing for similar loans or securities that are backed by similar loans are not available  the estimated fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale are determined using independent broker quotations  which is intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from third parties 
certain other mortgages have also been designated as held for sale which are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs determined on an individual loan basis 
for these loans  estimated fair value is determined using independent broker quotations or  when the loan is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral estimated using internal models 
mortgage servicing rights msrs are measured at estimated fair value and are either acquired or are generated from the sale of originated residential mortgage loans where the servicing rights are retained by the company 
the estimated fair value of msrs is principally determined through the use of internal discounted cash flow models which utilize various assumptions as to discount rates  loan prepayments  and servicing costs 
the use of different valuation assumptions and inputs as well as assumptions relating to the collection of expected cash flows may have a material effect on msrs estimated fair values 
financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity 
the company s ability to sell securities  or the price ultimately realized for these securities  depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities 
investment impairments one of the significant estimates related to available for sale securities is the evaluation of investments for other than temporary impairments 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value 
the company s review of its fixed maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities i securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than  ii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for less than six months  and iii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for six months or greater 
an extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments and the company s evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows  as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the security  including holding the security until the earlier of a recovery in value  or until maturity 
in contrast  for certain equity securities  greater weight and consideration are given by the company to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover 
additionally  management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair value has been below cost or amortized cost  
table of contents ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost  vii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage backed and asset backed securities  and viii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
the cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary in the period in which the determination is made 
these impairments are included within net investment gains losses and the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities is reduced accordingly 
the company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value 
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon the company s periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 
recognition of income on certain investment entities the recognition of income on certain investments eg loan backed securities  including mortgage backed and asset backed securities  certain structured investment transactions  trading securities  etc 
is dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned 
application of the consolidation rules to certain investments additionally  the company has invested in certain structured transactions that are vies under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin r 
these structured transactions include reinsurance trusts  asset backed securitizations  trust preferred securities  joint ventures  limited partnerships and limited liability companies 
the company is required to consolidate those vies for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
the accounting rules under fin r for the determination of when an entity is a vie and when to consolidate a vie are complex 
the determination of the vie s primary beneficiary requires an evaluation of the contractual rights and obligations associated with each party involved in the entity  an estimate of the entity s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party involved in the entity 
fin r defines the primary beneficiary as the entity that will absorb a majority of a vie s expected losses  receive a majority of a vie s expected residual returns if no single entity absorbs a majority of expected losses  or both 
when determining the primary beneficiary for structured investment products such as asset backed securitizations and collateralized debt obligations  the company uses historical default probabilities based on the credit rating of each issuer and other inputs including maturity dates  industry classifications and geographic location 
using computational algorithms  the analysis simulates default scenarios resulting in a range of expected losses and the probability associated with each occurrence 
for other investment structures such as trust preferred securities  joint ventures  limited partnerships and limited liability companies  the company gains an understanding of the design of the vie and generally uses a qualitative approach to determine if it is the primary beneficiary 
this approach includes an analysis of all contractual rights and obligations held by all parties including profit and loss allocations  repayment or residual value guarantees  put and call options and other derivative instruments 
if the primary beneficiary of a vie can not be identified using this qualitative approach  the company calculates the 
table of contents expected losses and expected residual returns of the vie using a probability weighted cash flow model 
the use of different methodologies  assumptions and inputs in the determination of the primary beneficiary could have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments the company enters into freestanding derivative transactions including swaps  forwards  futures and option contracts 
the company uses derivatives primarily to manage various risks 
the risks being managed are variability in cash flows or changes in estimated fair values related to financial instruments and currency exposure associated with net investments in certain foreign operations 
to a lesser extent  the company uses credit derivatives  such as credit default swaps  to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash market 
the estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices for exchange traded derivatives and financial forwards to sell residential mortgage backed securities or through the use of pricing models for over the counter derivatives 
the determination of estimated fair value  when quoted market values are not available  is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to be consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments 
derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  credit spreads  default risk including the counterparties to the contract  volatility  liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models 
the significant inputs to the pricing models for most over the counter derivatives are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
significant inputs that are observable generally include interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rate curves  credit curves  and volatility 
however  certain over the counter derivatives may rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
significant inputs that are unobservable generally include independent broker quotes  credit correlation assumptions  references to emerging market currencies  and inputs that are outside the observable portion of the interest rate curve  credit curve  volatility  or other relevant market measure 
these unobservable inputs may involve significant management judgment or estimation 
even though unobservable  these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments 
most inputs for over the counter derivatives are mid market inputs but  in certain cases  bid level inputs are used when they are deemed more representative of exit value 
market liquidity as well as the use of different methodologies  assumptions and inputs may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the company s derivatives and could materially affect net income 
also  fluctuations in the estimated fair value of derivatives which have not been designated for hedge accounting may result in significant volatility in net income 
the credit risk of both the counterparty and the company are considered in determining the estimated fair value for all over the counter derivatives after taking into account the effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements 
credit risk is monitored and consideration of any potential credit adjustment is based on a net exposure by counterparty 
this is due to the existence of netting agreements and collateral arrangements which effectively serve to mitigate credit risk 
the company values its derivative positions using the standard swap curve which includes a credit risk adjustment 
this credit risk adjustment is appropriate for those parties that execute trades at pricing levels consistent with the standard swap curve 
as the company and its significant derivative counterparties consistently execute trades at such pricing levels  additional credit risk adjustments are not currently required in the valuation process 
the need for such additional credit risk adjustments is monitored by the company 
the company s ability to consistently execute at such pricing levels is in part due to the netting agreements and collateral arrangements that are in place with all of its significant derivative counterparties 
the evaluation of the requirement to make an additional credit risk adjustments is performed by the company each reporting period 
the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice 
judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment under these accounting standards 
if it was determined that 
table of contents hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied  reported net income could be materially affected 
differences in judgment as to the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company from that previously reported 
assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income 
embedded derivatives embedded derivatives principally include certain variable annuity riders and certain guaranteed investment contracts with equity or bond indexed crediting rates 
embedded derivatives are recorded in the financial statements at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value adjusted through net income 
the company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefit riders 
these include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb riders  guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab riders  and certain guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib riders 
gmwb  gmab and certain gmib riders are embedded derivatives  which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract  with changes in estimated fair value reported in net investment gains losses 
the estimated fair value for these riders is estimated using the present value of future benefits minus the present value of future fees using actuarial and capital market assumptions related to the projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts 
the projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
a risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the riders are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk free rates 
beginning in  the valuation of these embedded derivatives now includes an adjustment for the company s own credit and risk margins for non capital market inputs 
the company s own credit adjustment is determined taking into consideration publicly available information relating to the company s debt as well as its claims paying ability 
risk margins are established to capture the non capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization  premium persistency  partial withdrawal and surrenders 
the establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment 
these riders may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets 
market conditions including  but not limited to  changes in interest rates  equity indices  market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the company s own credit standing  and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior  and risk margins related to non capital market inputs may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the riders that could materially affect net income 
the company ceded the risk associated with certain of the gmib and gmab riders described in the preceding paragraphs 
the value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the riders directly written by the company 
the estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed derivatives contained in certain guaranteed investment contracts is determined using market standard swap valuation models and observable market inputs  including an adjustment for the company s own credit that takes into consideration publicly available information relating to the company s debt as well as its claims paying ability 
changes in equity and bond indices  interest rates and the company s credit standing may result in significant fluctuations in estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income 
the accounting for embedded derivatives is complex and interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice 
if interpretations change  there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income 

table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
costs that vary with and relate to the production of new business are deferred as dac 
such costs consist principally of commissions and agency and policy issuance expenses 
voba is an intangible asset that reflects the estimated fair value of in force contracts in a life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the business in force at the acquisition date 
voba is based on actuarially determined projections  by each block of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  operating expenses  investment returns and other factors 
actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections 
the recovery of dac and voba is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
dac and voba are aggregated in the financial statements for reporting purposes 
dac for property and casualty insurance contracts  which is primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting expenses  is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term or reinsurance treaty 
dac and voba on life insurance or investment type contracts are amortized in proportion to gross premiums  gross margins or gross profits  depending on the type of contract as described below 
the company amortizes dac and voba related to non participating and non dividend paying traditional contracts term insurance  non participating whole life insurance  non medical health insurance  and traditional group life insurance over the entire premium paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and expected future gross premiums 
the present value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement of each policy and assumptions for mortality  morbidity  persistency  and investment returns at policy issuance  or policy acquisition  as it relates to voba  that include provisions for adverse deviation and are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit liabilities 
these assumptions are not revised after policy issuance or acquisition unless the dac or voba balance is deemed to be unrecoverable from future expected profits 
absent a premium deficiency  variability in amortization after policy issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium volumes 
the company amortizes dac and voba related to participating  dividend paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross margins 
the amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts 
the future gross margins are dependent principally on investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  mortality  persistency  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties  and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
for participating contracts dividend paying traditional contracts within the closed block future gross margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder dividend obligation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns  expenses  persistency  and other factor changes and policyholder dividend scales are reasonably likely to impact significantly the rate of dac and voba amortization 
each reporting period  the company updates the estimated gross margins with the actual gross margins for that period 
when the actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross margins  the cumulative dac and voba amortization is re estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations 
when actual gross margins exceed those previously estimated  the dac and voba amortization will increase  resulting in a current period charge to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below the previously estimated gross margins 
each reporting period  the company also updates the actual amount of business in force  which impacts expected future gross margins 
when expected future gross margins are below those previously estimated  the dac and voba amortization will increase  resulting in a current period charge to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the expected future gross margins are above the previously estimated expected future gross margins 
total dac and voba amortization during a particular period may increase or decrease depending upon the relative size of the amortization change resulting from the adjustment to dac and voba for the update of actual gross margins and the re estimation of expected future gross margins 
each period  the company also reviews the estimated gross margins for each block of business to determine the recoverability of dac and voba balances 
the company amortizes dac and voba related to fixed and variable universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross profits 
the amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the 
table of contents contracts 
the amount of future gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders  mortality  persistency  interest crediting rates  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties  the effect of any hedges used  and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns  expenses  and persistency are reasonably likely to impact significantly the rate of dac and voba amortization 
each reporting period  the company updates the estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that period 
when the actual gross profits change from previously estimated gross profits  the cumulative dac and voba amortization is re estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations 
when actual gross profits exceed those previously estimated  the dac and voba amortization will increase  resulting in a current period charge to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are below the previously estimated gross profits 
each reporting period  the company also updates the actual amount of business remaining in force  which impacts expected future gross profits 
when expected future gross profits are below those previously estimated  the dac and voba amortization will increase  resulting in a current period charge to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the expected future gross profits are above the previously estimated expected future gross profits 
total dac and voba amortization during a particular period may increase or decrease depending upon the relative size of the amortization change resulting from the adjustment to dac and voba for the update of actual gross profits and the re estimation of expected future gross profits 
each period  the company also reviews the estimated gross profits for each block of business to determine the recoverability of dac and voba balances 
separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in force account balances on such contracts each reporting period which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of dac and voba 
returns that are higher than the company s long term expectation produce higher account balances  which increases the company s future fee expectations and decreases future benefit payment expectations on minimum death and living benefit guarantees  resulting in higher expected future gross profits 
the opposite result occurs when returns are lower than the company s long term expectation 
the company s practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short term market fluctuations  but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected 
the company monitors these changes and only changes the assumption when its long term expectation changes 
the effect of an increase decrease by basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease increase in the dac and voba balances of approximately million with an offset to the company s unearned revenue liability of approximately million for this factor 
during  the company did not change its long term expectation of equity market appreciation 
the company also reviews periodically other long term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits 
these include investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  interest crediting rates  mortality  persistency  and expenses to administer business 
management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed 
if the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase  dac and voba amortization will decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease 
over the last several years  the company s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of dac and voba have been updated due to revisions to expected future investment returns  expenses  in force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on contracts included within the individual segment 
during  the amount of net investment gains losses as well as the level of separate account balances also resulted in significant changes to expected future gross margins and profits impacting amortization of dac and voba 
the company expects these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and the company is unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a rollforward of dac and voba for the company for each of the years ended december   and as well as a breakdown of dac and voba by segment and reporting unit at december  and at december  and  dac and voba for the company was billion and billion  respectively 
a substantial portion  approximately 
table of contents  of the company s dac and voba is associated with the individual segment which had dac and voba of billion and billion  respectively  at december  and amortization of dac and voba associated with the variable universal life and the annuities reporting units within the individual segment are significantly impacted by movements in equity markets 
the following chart illustrates the effect on dac and voba within the company s individual segment of changing each of the respective assumptions as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended december   and increases decreases in dac and voba balances  as presented below  result in a corresponding decrease increase in amortization 
years ended december  in millions investment return separate account balances net investment gain loss related expense in force persistency policyholder dividends and other total prior to  fluctuations in the amounts presented in the table above arose principally from normal assumption reviews during the period 
during  there was a significant increase in dac and voba amortization attributable to the following the decrease in equity markets during the year significantly lowered separate account balances resulting in a significant reduction in expected future gross profits on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting in an increase of million in dac and voba amortization 
changes in net investment gains losses resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities resulting in a reduction of dac and voba amortization of  million 
this decrease in actual gross profits was mitigated by freestanding derivative gains associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations which resulted in an increase in actual gross profits and an increase in dac and voba amortization of million 
a change in valuation of guarantee liabilities  resulting from the adoption of sfas during  also impacted the computation of actual gross profits and the related amortization of dac and voba 
the addition of risk margins increased the guarantee liability valuations  decreased actual gross profits and decreased amortization by million 
offsetting this was the addition of own credit to the valuation of guarantee liabilities 
own credit decreased guarantee liability valuations  increased actual gross profits and increased amortization by million 
the inclusion of the company s own credit in the valuation of these guarantee liabilities increases the volatility of these valuations  the related dac and voba amortization  and the net income of the company 
as more extensively described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  reductions in both actual and expected cumulative earnings of the closed block resulting from recent experience in the closed block combined with changes in expected dividend scales resulted in an increase in closed block dac amortization of million  million of which is related to net investment gains losses 
the remainder of the impact of net investment gains losses on dac amortization of million was attributable to numerous immaterial items 
increases in amortization in resulting from changes in assumptions related to in force persistency of million were driven by higher than anticipated mortality and lower than anticipated premium persistency during the current year 

table of contents the company s dac and voba balance is also impacted by unrealized investment gains losses and the amount of amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and losses had been recognized 
the significant increase in unrealized investment losses at december  resulted in an increase in dac and voba of billion 
notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements include the dac and voba offset to unrealized investment losses 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
the company performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of the second quarter 
impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach  which requires the use of estimates and judgment  at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment  if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  a significant portion of goodwill within corporate other is allocated to reporting units within the company s business segments 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value  there is an indication of impairment and the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill would be determined in a business acquisition 
the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill is recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income 
in performing its goodwill impairment tests  when management believes meaningful comparable market data are available  the estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a market multiple approach 
when relevant comparables are not available  the company uses a discounted cash flow model 
for reporting units which are particularly sensitive to market assumptions  such as the annuities and variable universal life reporting units within the individual segment  the company may corroborate its estimated fair values by using additional valuation methodologies 
the key inputs  judgments and assumptions necessary in determining fair value include projected operating earnings  current book value with and without accumulated other comprehensive income  the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business  long term growth rates  comparative market multiples  the account value of in force business  projections of new and renewal business as well as margins on such business  the level of interest rates  credit spreads  equity market levels  and the discount rate management believes appropriate to the risk associated with the respective reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of the annuity and variable universal life reporting units are particularly sensitive to the equity market levels 
when testing goodwill for impairment  management also considers the company s market capitalization in relation to its book value 
management believes that the overall decrease in the company s current market capitalization is not representative of a long term decrease in the value of the underlying reporting units 
management applies significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the estimated fair value of its reporting units and their book value 
the valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change 
estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
declines in the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial position 
management continues to evaluate current market conditions that may affect the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists 
continued deteriorating or adverse 
table of contents market conditions for certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result in future impairments of goodwill 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations goodwill for further consideration of goodwill impairment testing during liability for future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies  including traditional life insurance  traditional annuities and non medical health insurance 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value of future expected premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  disability incidence  disability terminations  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumptions  additional liabilities may be required  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations  expenses and interest 
liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
other policyholder funds include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported on life and non medical health insurance 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon the company s historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
the effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and secondary and paid up guarantees relating to certain life policies are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
the assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing dac  and are thus subject to the same variability and risk 
the assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical s p experience 
the company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with its actual experience 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies  guarantees and riders and in the establishment of the related liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 
the effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
income taxes income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with its operations 
the company provides for federal  state and foreign income taxes currently payable  as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and transactions 

table of contents deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
valuation allowances are established when management determines  based on available information  that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
factors in management s determination consider the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains 
significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established  as well as the amount of such allowances 
when making such determination  consideration is given to  among other things  the following i future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  iii taxable income in prior carryback years  and iv tax planning strategies 
the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in the financial statements 
a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
the company may be required to change its provision for income taxes when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is challenged by taxing authorities or when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change  or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances 
additionally  future events  such as changes in tax laws  tax regulations  or interpretations of such laws or regulations  could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate 
any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur 
reinsurance the company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products issued by third parties 
accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance agreements  the company determines if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company reviews all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the agreement using the deposit method of accounting 
employee benefit plans certain subsidiaries of the holding company the subsidiaries sponsor and or administer pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the obligations and expenses associated with these plans require an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  healthcare cost trend rates  as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements  withdrawal rates and mortality 
management  in consultation with its external consulting actuarial firm  determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical performance of the plan and its assets  currently available market and industry data  and expected benefit payout streams 
the assumptions used may differ materially from actual results 
table of contents due to  among other factors  changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
litigation contingencies the company is a party to a number of legal actions and is involved in a number of regulatory investigations 
given the inherent unpredictability of these matters  it is difficult to estimate the impact on the company s financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates 
the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims  the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed  the possible impact of tort reform efforts  the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the company when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known  and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
on a quarterly and annual basis  the company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation  regulatory investigations and litigation related contingencies to be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation and regulatory investigations  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
economic capital economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in metlife s businesses 
as a part of the economic capital process  a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory risk based capital rbc formula  which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the company s businesses 

table of contents results of operations discussion of results the following table presents consolidated financial information for the company for the years indicated years ended december  in millions revenues premiums universal life and investment type product policy fees net investment income other revenues net investment gains losses total revenues expenses policyholder benefits and claims interest credited to policyholder account balances policyholder dividends other expenses total expenses income from continuing operations before provision for income tax provision for income tax income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax net income preferred stock dividends net income available to common shareholders year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company income from continuing operations decreased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
the following table provides the change from the prior year in income from continuing operations by segment change in millions institutional individual international auto home corporate other total change  net of income tax the institutional segment s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to a decrease in net investment losses and a decrease in policyholder benefits due to investment losses shared by policyholders 
there was also a decrease in other expenses due in part to lower expenses related to dac amortization which is primarily 
table of contents due to the impact of the implementation of sop  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop in the prior year and amortization refinements in the current year 
these increases were offset by lower underwriting results in retirement savings  non medical health other  and group life businesses 
there was also a decrease in interest margins within the retirement savings and non medical health other businesses  partially offset by an increase in the group life business 
the individual segment s income from continuing operations decreased due to higher dac amortization partially offset by a decrease in net investment losses due to an increase in gains on freestanding derivatives partially offset by losses primarily relating to embedded derivatives and fixed maturity securities including those resulting from intersegment transfers of securities 
the embedded derivative losses are net of gains relating to the effect of the widening of the company s own credit spread 
income from continuing operations also decreased due to decreases in interest margins  unfavorable underwriting results in life products  an increase in interest credited to policyholder account balances  higher annuity benefits  lower universal life and investment type product policy fees combined with other revenues  and an increase in policyholder dividends 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses as well as an increase in net investment income on blocks of business not driven by interest margins 
the international segment s decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to a decrease in income from continuing operations relating to argentina and japan 
the decrease in argentina s income from continuing operations was due to the negative impact the pension reform had on current year income from continuing operations 
the decrease was partially offset by the net impact resulting from the argentine nationalization of the private pension system as well as refinements to certain contingent and insurance liabilities associated with a supreme court ruling 
the company s earnings from its investment in japan decreased due to an increase in losses on embedded derivatives associated with variable annuity riders  an increase in dac amortization related to market performance and the impact of a refinement in assumptions for the guaranteed annuity business partially offset by the favorable impact from the utilization of the fair value option for certain fixed annuities 
the company s results were also impacted by a decrease in earnings from assumed reinsurance  offset by an increase in income from hedging activities associated with japan s guaranteed annuity benefits 
these decreases were offset by an increase in net investment gains which was due to an increase from gains on derivatives primarily in japan partially offset by losses primarily on fixed maturity investments 
there was also an increase in income from continuing operations relating to hong kong associated with the remaining interest in metlife fubon acquired in the in the second quarter of the auto home segment s decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily attributable to an increase in net investment losses and an increase in policyholder benefits and claims 
the increase in net investment losses was due to an increase in losses on fixed maturity and equity securities 
the increase in policyholder benefits and claims was comprised primarily of an increase in catastrophe losses offset by a decrease in non catastrophe policyholder benefits and claims 
offsetting these decreases was an increase in premiums 
income from continuing operations for corporate other decreased due to lower net investment income as well as higher corporate expenses  interest expense  legal costs and interest credited to policyholder account balances 
these decreases were offset by an increase in net investment gains  higher other revenues  lower interest on uncertain tax positions  and lower interest credited to bankholder deposits 
the increase in net investment gains was primarily due to an elimination of losses which were recognized by other segments  partially offset by losses on fixed maturity securities and derivatives 
revenues and expenses premiums  fees and other revenues premiums  fees and other revenues increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 

table of contents the following table provides the change from the prior year in premiums  fees and other revenues by segment of total change change in millions institutional individual international auto home corporate other total change the institutional segment s increase in premiums  fees and other revenues was primarily due to increases in the retirement savings  non medical health other and group life businesses 
the increase in the retirement savings business was primarily due to increases in premiums in the group institutional annuity  structured settlement and global gic businesses 
the increase in both group institutional annuity and the structured settlement businesses were primarily due to higher sales 
the increase in the group institutional annuity business was primarily due to large domestic sales and the first significant sales in the united kingdom business in the current year 
the growth in the non medical health other business was largely due to increases in the dental  disability  accidental death dismemberment ad d  and individual disability insurance idi businesses 
the increase in the dental business was primarily due to organic growth in the business and the impact of an acquisition that closed in the first quarter of the increase in group life business was primarily due to an increase in term life  which was largely attributable to business growth  partially offset by a decrease in assumed reinsurance 
the individual segment s decrease in premiums  fees and other revenues was primarily attributable to decreases in universal life and investment type product policy fees and other revenues 
these decreases were due to lower average separate account balances due to unfavorable equity market performance during the current year  as well as revisions to management s assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and margins 
these decreases were partially offset by universal life business growth over the prior year 
the international segment s increase in premiums  fees and other revenues was primarily due to business growth in the latin america region  as well as the impact of an acquisition in the asia pacific region  and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
chile s premiums  fees and other revenues increased primarily due to higher annuity sales  as well as higher institutional premiums from its traditional and bank distribution channels 
mexico s premiums  fees and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in its individual and institutional businesses  as well as the reinstatement of premiums from prior periods 
hong kong s increase was due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in metlife fubon in the second quarter of and the resulting consolidation of the operation beginning in the third quarter of the united kingdom s premiums  fees and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in the reinsurance business as well as the prior year impact of an unearned premium calculation refinement 
south korea s premiums  fees and other revenues increased due to growth in its guaranteed annuity and variable universal life businesses  as well as in its traditional business 
australia s premiums  fees and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in the institutional business and an increase in retention levels 
these increases in premiums  fees and other revenues were partially offset by a decrease in argentina primarily due to a decrease in premiums in the pension business  for which pension reform eliminated the obligation of plan administrators to provide death and disability coverage effective january  the auto home segment reflected no change when compared to the prior year although a slight increase in premiums was offset by lower other revenues 
the increase in corporate other premiums  fees and other revenues was primarily related to metlife bank loan origination and servicing fees from acquisitions in and an adjustment of surrender values on corporate owned life insurance coli policies in the prior year  partially offset by lower revenue from a prior year resolution of an indemnification claim associated with the acquisition of galic 

table of contents net investment income net investment income decreased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
management attributes  million of this change to a decrease in yields  partially offset by an increase of  million due to growth in average invested assets 
average invested assets are calculated on cost basis without unrealized gains and losses 
the decrease in net investment income attributable to lower yields was primarily due to lower returns on other limited partnership interests  real estate joint ventures  short term investments  fixed maturity securities  and mortgage loans  partially offset by improved securities lending results 
management anticipates that the significant volatility in the equity  real estate and credit markets will continue in which could continue to impact net investment income and yields on other limited partnership interests and real estate joint ventures 
the decrease in net investment income attributable to lower yields was partially offset by increased net investment income attributable to an increase in average invested assets on an amortized cost basis  primarily within short term investments  mortgage loans  other limited partnership interests  and real estate joint ventures 
interest margin interest margin  which represents the difference between interest earned and interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased in the individual segment for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in interest margin within the individual segment was primarily attributable to a decline in net investment income due to lower returns on other limited partnership interests  real estate joint ventures  other invested assets including derivatives  and short term investments  all of which were partially offset by higher securities lending results 
interest margins decreased in the retirement savings and non medical health other businesses  but increased within the group life business  all within the institutional segment 
interest earned approximates net investment income on investable assets attributed to the segment with minor adjustments related to the consolidation of certain separate accounts and other minor non policyholder elements 
interest credited is the amount attributed to insurance products  recorded in policyholder benefits and claims  and the amount credited to policyholder account balances for investment type products  recorded in interest credited to policyholder account balances 
interest credited on insurance products reflects the current period impact of the interest rate assumptions established at issuance or acquisition 
interest credited to policyholder account balances is subject to contractual terms  including some minimum guarantees 
this tends to move gradually over time to reflect market interest rate movements and may reflect actions by management to respond to competitive pressures and  therefore  generally does not introduce volatility in expense 
net investment gains losses net investment losses decreased by  million to a gain of  million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the comparable period 
the decrease in net investment losses is due to an increase in gains on derivatives partially offset by losses primarily on fixed maturity and equity securities 
derivative gains were driven by gains on freestanding derivatives that were partially offset by losses on embedded derivatives primarily associated with variable annuity riders 
gains on freestanding derivatives increased by  million and were primarily driven by i gains on certain interest rate swaps  floors  and swaptions which were economic hedges of certain investment assets and liabilities  ii gains from foreign currency derivatives primarily due to the us dollar strengthening as well as  iii gains primarily from equity options  financial futures and interest rate swaps hedging the embedded derivatives 
the gains on these equity options  financial futures  and interest rate swaps substantially offset the change in the underlying embedded derivative liability that is hedged by these derivatives 
losses on the embedded derivatives increased by  million and were driven by declining interest rates and poor equity market performance throughout the year 
these embedded derivative losses include a  million gain resulting from the effect of the widening of the company s own credit spread which is required to be used in the valuation of these variable annuity rider embedded derivatives under sfas which became effective january  the remaining change in net investment losses of  million is principally attributable to an increase in losses on fixed maturity and equity securities  and  to a lesser degree  an increase in losses on mortgage and consumer loans and other limited partnership interests offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction gains 
the increase in losses on fixed maturity and equity securities is primarily attributable to 
table of contents an increase in impairments associated with financial services industry holdings which experienced losses as a result of bankruptcies  fdic receivership  and federal government assisted capital infusion transactions in the third and fourth quarters of losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were also driven by an increase in credit related impairments on communication and consumer sector security holdings  losses on asset backed securities as well as an increase in losses on fixed maturity security holdings where the company either lacked the intent to hold  or due to extensive credit widening  the company was uncertain of its intent to hold these fixed maturity securities for a period of time sufficient to allow recovery of the market value decline 
underwriting underwriting results are generally the difference between the portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality  morbidity or other insurance costs  less claims incurred  and the change in insurance related liabilities 
underwriting results are significantly influenced by mortality  morbidity or other insurance related experience trends  as well as the reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of business 
consequently  results can fluctuate from year to year 
underwriting results  including catastrophes  in the auto home segment were unfavorable for the year ended december   as the combined ratio  including catastrophes  increased to from for the year ended december  underwriting results  excluding catastrophes  in the auto home segment were favorable for the year ended december   as the combined ratio  excluding catastrophes  decreased to from for the year ended december  underwriting results were less favorable in the non medical health other  retirement savings and group life businesses in the institutional segment 
underwriting results were unfavorable in the life products in the individual segment 
other expenses other expenses increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
the following table provides the change from the prior year in other expenses by segment change in millions institutional individual international auto home corporate other total change the institutional segment s decrease in other expenses was principally due to a decrease in dac amortization primarily due to a charge associated with the impact of dac and voba amortization from the implementation of sop in the prior year and a decrease mainly due to the impact of amortization refinements in the current year 
this decrease was offset by increases in non deferrable volume related expenses and corporate support expenses 
also offsetting this decrease was the impact of revisions to certain pension and postretirement liabilities in the current year 
the individual segment s increase in other expenses included higher dac amortization primarily related to lower expected future gross profits due to separate account balance decreases resulting from recent market declines  higher net investment gains primarily due to net derivative gains and the reduction in expected cumulative earnings of the closed block partially offset by a reduction in actual earnings of the closed block and changes in assumptions used to estimate future gross profits and margins 
there was an additional increase due to the impact of revisions to certain pension and postretirement liabilities in the current year 
the increases in other expenses were offset by a decrease in nondeferrable volume related expenses and by the write off of a receivable from a joint venture partner in the prior year 

table of contents the international segment s decrease in other expenses was driven mainly by argentina s prior year pension liability and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
the decrease in argentina s other expenses was primarily due to the establishment in the prior year of a liability for pension servicing obligations due to pension reform  the elimination of the liability for pension servicing obligations and the elimination of dac for the pension business in the current year as a result of the nationalization of the pension system  as well as the elimination of contingent liabilities for certain cases due to recent court decisions related to the pesification of insurance contracts by the government in this decrease was offset primarily by an increase in other expenses in south korea  the united kingdom  and other countries 
south korea s other expenses increased primarily due to an increase in dac amortization related to market performance  as well as higher spending on advertising and marketing  offset by a refinement in dac capitalization 
the united kingdom s other expenses increased due to business growth as well as lower dac amortization in the prior year resulting from calculation refinements partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains 
other expenses increased in india  chile and mexico primarily due to growth initiatives 
contributions from the other countries accounted for the remainder of the change in other expenses 
the auto home segment s decrease in other expenses was principally as a result of lower commissions  decrease in surveys and underwriting reports and other sales related expenses  partially offset by an unfavorable change in dac capitalization  net of amortization 
the increase in other expenses in corporate other was primarily due to higher metlife bank costs  higher post employment related costs in the current period associated with the implementation of an enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative  higher corporate support expenses including incentive compensation  rent  advertising and information technology costs 
corporate expenses also increased from lease impairments for company use space that is currently vacant and higher costs from metlife foundation contributions  partially offset by a reduction in deferred compensation expenses 
interest expense was higher due to issuances of junior subordinated debt in december and april and collateral financing arrangements in may and december  partially offset by rate reductions on variable rate collateral financing arrangements in  the prepayment of shares subject to mandatory redemption in october and the reduction of commercial paper outstanding 
higher legal costs were principally driven by costs associated with the commutation of three asbestos related excess insurance policies and decreases in prior year legal liabilities partially offset by current year decreases resulting from the resolution of certain matters 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in decreases in interest credited on bankholder deposits and interest on uncertain tax positions 
net income income tax expense for the year ended december  was  million  or of income from continuing operations before provision for income tax  versus  million  or of such income  for the comparable period 
the and effective tax rates differ from the corporate tax rate of primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing 
in addition  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to changes in the ratio of permanent differences to income before income taxes 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax  decreased by million to a loss of million for the year ended december  from income of million for the comparable period 
the decrease was primarily the result of the split off of substantially all of the company s interest in rga in september whereby stockholders of the company were offered the ability to exchange their metlife shares for shares of rga class b common stock 
this resulted in a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million  net of income tax 
income from discontinued operations related to rga s operations also decreased by million  net of income tax  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the holding company entered into an agreement to sell its wholly owned subsidiary  cova  which resulted in a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of million  net of income tax 
income from discontinued operations related to cova also decreased by million  net of income tax  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  there was a reduction in income from discontinued operations of million related to the sale of ssrm and of million related to the sale of metlife australia s annuities and pension businesses to a third party 
there was also a decrease in income from discontinued real estate operations of million 

table of contents year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company income from continuing operations income from continuing operations increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
the following table provides the change in income from continuing operations by segment of total change change in millions institutional individual international auto home corporate other total change  net of income tax the institutional segment s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to an increase in interest margins  an increase in underwriting results  lower net investment losses and the impact of revisions to certain expenses in both periods  partially offset by higher expenses due to an increase in non deferrable volume related and corporate support expenses and an increase in dac amortization resulting from the implementation of sop in the individual segment s income from continuing operations increased primarily due to a decrease in net investment losses  higher fee income from separate account products  higher net investment income on blocks of business not driven by interest margins and an increase in interest margins  partially offset by higher dac amortization  unfavorable underwriting results in life products  higher general expenses  the impact of revisions to certain liabilities in both years  the write off of a receivable in  an increase in the closed block related policyholder dividend obligation  higher annuity benefits  increase in policyholder dividends  and an increase in interest credited to policyholder account balances 
the increase in the international segment s income from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors an increase in argentina s income from continuing operations primarily due to a net reduction of liabilities resulting from pension reform  a reduction in claim liabilities resulting from experience reviews in both and years  higher premiums resulting from higher pension contributions attributable to higher participant salaries  higher net investment income resulting from capital contributions in  and a smaller increase in market indexed policyholder liabilities without a corresponding decrease in net investment income  partially offset by the reduction of cost of insurance fees as a result of the new pension system reform regulation  an increase in retention incentives related to pension reform  as well as lower trading portfolio income 
argentina also benefited  in both the current and prior years  from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards against which valuation allowances had been previously established

liquidity and capital resources extraordinary market conditions since mid september  the global financial markets have experienced unprecedented disruption  adversely affecting the business environment in general  as well as financial services companies in particular 
the us government  as well as governments in many foreign markets in which the company operates  have responded to address market imbalances and taken meaningful steps intended to eventually restore market confidence 
continuing adverse financial market conditions could significantly affect the company s ability to meet liquidity needs and obtain capital 
liquidity management 
based upon the strength of its franchise  diversification of its businesses and strong financial fundamentals  management believes that the company has ample liquidity and capital resources to meet business requirements under current market conditions 
processes for monitoring and managing liquidity risk  including liquidity stress models  have been enhanced to take into account the extraordinary market conditions  including the impact on policyholder and counterparty behavior  the ability to sell various investment assets and the ability to raise incremental funding from various sources 
management has taken steps to strengthen liquidity in light of its assessment of the impact of market conditions and will continue to monitor the situation closely 
asset liability management alm needs and opportunities are also being evaluated and managed in light of market conditions and  where appropriate  alm strategies are adjusted to achieve management goals and objectives 
the company s short term liquidity position cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  excluding cash collateral received under the company s securities lending program and in connection with derivative instruments that has been reinvested in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
this higher than normal level of short term liquidity was accumulated to provide additional flexibility to address potential variations in cash needs while credit market conditions remained distressed 
in  we anticipate short term liquidity will be brought down in a prudent manner and invested according to the company s alm discipline in appropriate assets over time 
there may be potential implications for earnings if the reinvestment process occurs over an extended period of time due to challenging market conditions or asset availability 
the asset portfolio will continue to be defensively positioned in with an emphasis on higher credit quality  more liquid asset types 
however  considering the continued  somewhat uncertain credit market conditions  management plans to continue to maintain a slightly higher than normal level of short term liquidity 
during this extraordinary market environment  management is continuously monitoring and adjusting its liquidity and capital plans for the holding company and its subsidiaries in light of changing needs and opportunities 
the dislocation in the credit markets has limited the access of financial institutions to long term debt and hybrid capital 
while  in general  yields on benchmark us treasury securities were historically low during  related spreads on debt instruments  in general  and those of financial institutions  specifically  were as high as they have been in metlife s history as a public company 
liquidity needs of the insurance business 
with respect to the company s insurance businesses  individual and institutional segments tend to behave differently under these extraordinary market conditions 
in the company s individual segment  which includes individual life and annuity products  lapses and surrenders occur in the normal course of business in many product areas 
these lapses and surrenders have not deviated materially from management expectations during the financial crisis 
for both fixed and variable annuities  net flows were positive and lapse rates declined 
within the institutional segment  the retirement savings business consists of general account values of billion at december  approximately  billion of that amount is comprised of pension closeouts  other fixed annuity contracts without surrender or withdrawal options  as well as global gics that have stated maturities and cannot be put back to the company prior to maturity 
as a result  the surrenders or withdrawals are 
table of contents fairly predictable and even during this difficult environment they have not deviated materially from management expectations 
with regard to institutional s retirement savings liabilities where customers have limited liquidity rights at december   there were billion of funding agreements that could be put back to the company after a period of notice 
while the notice requirements vary  the shortest is days  and that applies to only billion of these liabilities 
the remainder of the notice periods are between and months  so even on the small portion of the portfolio where there is ability to accelerate withdrawal  the exposure is relatively limited 
with respect to credit ratings downgrade triggers that permit early termination  less than billion of the retirement savings liabilities were subject to such triggers 
in addition  such early terminations payments are subject to day prior notice 
management controls the liquidity exposure that can arise from these various product features 
securities lending 
the company s securities lending business has been affected by the extraordinary market environment 
in this activity  blocks of securities  which are included in fixed maturity and short term investments  are loaned to third parties  primarily major brokerage firms and commercial banks 
the company generally requires a minimum of of the current estimated fair value of the loaned securities to be obtained at inception of a loan  and maintained at a level greater than or equal to for duration of the loan 
during the extraordinary market events occurring in the fourth quarter of  the company  in limited instances  accepted collateral less than at the inception of certain loans  but never less than  of the market value of loaned such loaned securities 
these loans involved us treasury bills  which are considered to have limited variation in their market value during the term of the loan 
securities with a cost or amortized cost of billion and billion and an estimated fair value of billion and billion were on loan under the program at december  and  respectively 
securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or repledged by the transferee 
the company was liable for cash collateral under its control of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
of this billion of cash collateral at december   billion was on open terms  meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to the company on the next business day requiring return of cash collateral and billion and billion are due within days and days  respectively 
the estimated fair value of the securities related to the cash collateral on open at december  has been reduced to billion from billion at november  of the billion of estimated fair value of the securities related to the cash collateral on open at december   billion were us treasury and agency securities which  if put to the company  could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirements 
the remainder of the securities on loan are primarily us treasury and agency securities and very liquid residential mortgage backed securities 
the us treasury securities on loan were primarily holdings of on the run us treasury securities  the most liquid us treasury securities available 
if these high quality securities that were on loan were put back to the company  the proceeds from immediately selling these securities could be used to satisfy the related cash requirements 
the estimated fair value of the reinvestment portfolio acquired with the cash collateral was billion at december   and consisted principally of fixed maturity securities including residential mortgage backed  asset backed  us corporate and foreign corporate securities 
if the on loan securities or the reinvestment portfolio were to become less liquid  the company has the liquidity resources of most of its general account available to meet any potential cash demand when securities are put back to the company 
based upon present market conditions  management anticipates the securities lending programs will be maintained in the to billion range 
this estimate has been factored into the company s liquidity and investment plans 
management plans to continue to lend securities and believes it has appropriate policies and guidelines in place to manage this activity at a reduced level through this extraordinary business environment 
see investments securities lending 
internal asset transfers 
metlife employs an internal asset transfer process that allows for the sale of securities among the business portfolio segments for the purposes of efficient asset liability matching 
the execution of the internally transferred assets is permitted when mutually beneficial to both business segments 
the asset is transferred at estimated fair market value with corresponding gains losses being eliminated in corporate other 
during the fourth quarter of  at a time of severe market disruption  internal asset transfers were utilized extensively to preserve economic value for metlife by transferring assets across business segments instead of selling them to external parties at depressed market prices 
securities with an estimated fair value of billion 
table of contents were transferred across business segments in the fourth quarter of generating billion in net investment losses  principally within individual and institutional  with the offset in corporate other s net investment gains losses 
collateral 
the company does not operate a financial guarantee or financial products business with exposures in derivative products that could give rise to extremely large collateral calls 
the company is a net receiver of collateral from counterparties under the company s current derivative transactions 
with respect to derivative transactions with credit ratings downgrade triggers  a two notch downgrade would impact the company s derivative collateral requirements by less than million at december  as a result  the company does not have significant exposure to any credit ratings dependent liquidity factors resulting from current derivatives positions 
holding company 
the holding company relies principally on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements 
none of the holding company long term debt is due before  so there is no near term roll over risk 
the holding company s commercial paper program  which amounts to million at december   is kept active but is not used to fund on going operating business requirements 
in addition to its other fixed obligations  the holding company has and may be required to pledge further collateral under collateral support agreements if the estimated fair value of the related derivatives and or collateral financing arrangements declines 
the holding company holds significant liquid assets of billion at december  at december   the holding company had pledged million of liquid assets under collateral support agreements 
see investments assets on deposit  held in trust and pledged as collateral 
government programs 
the company is participating in certain economic stabilization programs established by various government institutions as described under the company liquidity and capital resources 
capital 
this shift resulted in a relative increase in the cost of new debt capital and new credit 
for example  in august  metlife remarketed senior unsecured debt with a ten year maturity at a coupon 
at december   the average coupon on ten year senior unsecured debt of the holding company  excluding the debt remarketed in august  is  or less than that of the debt remarketed in august metlife has no floating rate debt  other than that of the collateral financing arrangements of billion which float based upon month libor and the proceeds of which are invested in floating rate assets  and has issued million in a single series of libor based preferred stock with a floor 
this series represents a small portion of metlife s fixed charges 
at current levels  libor would have to increase by basis points over increase to have any impact on the dividend for these preferred securities 
metlife amended and restated certain of its credit agreements in december these changes included increases in pricing for these agreements compared to the original rates 
in february  the holding company closed the successful remarketing of the series b portion of the junior subordinated debentures underlying the common equity units 
the series b junior subordinated debentures were modified as permitted by their terms to be senior debt securities  series b  due february  see subsequent events 
this issuance reflects a moderate increase in the company s cost of borrowing 
as discussed above  market values experienced significant volatility during the third and fourth quarters of this market disruption impacted unrealized gains and losses  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
to strengthen our capital position and increase our cushion against potential realized and unrealized losses in october  the company issued common stock for gross proceeds of billion to be used for general corporate purposes and potential strategic initiatives 
metlife has no current plans to raise additional capital 

table of contents the company capital capital and liquidity represent the financial strength of the company and reflect its ability to generate strong cash flows at the operating companies  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs 
to strengthen its capital position  in october  the company issued billion of common stock 
the company s capital structure is managed to maintain a aa financial strength ratings target 
statutory capital and dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and rbc levels well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements and levels needed to support the business risk at an aa financial strength rating 
rbc requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the national association of insurance commissioners naic and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit further regulatory action 
rbc is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and statutory reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis 
the formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
these rules apply to each of the holding company s domestic insurance subsidiaries 
state insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by  or take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain rbc levels 
at the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators  the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those rbc levels 
the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay to metlife  inc or other parent entities is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings  and to provide an additional margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses 
we proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives  which may include adjusting dividend amounts and redeploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital 
certain of these activities may require regulatory approval 
rating agencies 
the rating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to the company s domestic life subsidiaries and credit ratings to subsidiaries of the company which directly issue or guarantee substantially all of the company s senior unsecured obligations 
the level and composition of our regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and equity capital of the company are among the many factors considered in determining the company s insurer financial strength and credit ratings 
each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors 
the company s financial strength ratings targets for its domestic life insurance companies are aa aa aa a for s p  moody s  fitch  and am best 
the company s long term senior debt credit rating targets are a a a a for s p  moody s  fitch  and am best 
in november  am best downgraded the insurer financial strength rating for texas life insurance company from a to a 
at december   am best  fitch  moody s and s p each had metlife and its subsidiaries insurer financial strength and credit ratings on stable outlook  however  i on february   moody s revised its outlook to negative  ii on february   fitch revised its outlook to negative and anticipates completing its review within the next several weeks and will reflect those results in the ratings at that time  iii on february   am best downgraded the credit ratings of metlife  inc and certain of its subsidiaries with a stable outlook  and iv on february   s p downgraded the insurer financial strength and credit ratings of metlife  inc and certain of its subsidiaries  with a substantive outlook 
in september and october  am best  fitch  moody s  and s p each revised its outlook for the us life insurance sector to negative from stable 
in january  s p reiterated its negative outlook on the us life insurance sector 
management believes that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions  may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  may request additional information 
table of contents from the companies that they rate  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ie  claims paying ratings of the company or its subsidiaries would likely impact the cost and availability of unsecured financing for the company and its subsidiaries and result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements 
liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs 
the company s liquidity position is defined as cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities excluding i cash collateral received under the company s securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities  ii cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivative instruments  iii cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities on deposit with regulatory agencies  and iv securities held in trust in support of collateral financing arrangements and pledged in support of debt and funding agreements 
the company s liquidity position was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
liquidity needs are determined from a rolling month forecast by portfolio and are monitored daily 
asset mix and maturities are adjusted based on forecast 
cash flow testing and stress testing provide additional perspectives on liquidity  which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal 
management believes that the company has ample liquidity and capital resources to meet business requirements and unlikely but reasonably possible stress scenarios under current market conditions 
the company includes provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of its products  including general account institutional pension products generally group annuities  including gics  and certain deposit fund liabilities sold to employee benefit plan sponsors 
certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product 
in the event of significant unanticipated cash requirements beyond normal liquidity needs  the company has various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need 
these options include cash flows from operations  the sale of liquid assets  global funding sources and various credit facilities 
under stressful market and economic conditions  liquidity broadly deteriorates which could negatively impact the company s ability to sell investment assets 
if the company requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements  the company may have difficulty selling investment assets in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than the company otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
in addition  in the event of such forced sale  accounting rules require the recognition of a loss and may require the impairment of other such securities based upon the company s ability to hold such securities which  may negatively impact the company s financial statements 
in extreme circumstances  all general account assets other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose within a statutory legal entity are available to fund obligations of the general account within that legal entity 
a disruption in the financial markets could limit the holding company s access to or cost of liquidity 
see extraordinary market conditions

global funding sources 
liquidity is also provided by a variety of short term instruments  including repurchase agreements and commercial paper 
capital is provided by a variety of long term instruments  including medium and long term debt  junior subordinated debt securities  capital securities and stockholders equity 
the diversity of the company s funding sources enhances flexibility  limits dependence on any one source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds

also included are contracts where the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death or illness  or where the occurrence of the payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy or contract  is outside the control of the company 
the company has estimated the timing of the cash flows related to these contracts based on historical experience as well as its expectation of future payment patterns 
liabilities related to accounting conventions or which are not contractually due  such as shadow liabilities  excess interest reserves and property and casualty loss adjustment expenses of million  have been excluded from amounts presented in the table above 
amounts presented in the table above  excluding those related to property and casualty contracts  represent the estimated cash payments for benefits under such contracts including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and assumptions related to mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  inflation  disability incidence  disability terminations  policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
payments for case reserve liabilities and incurred but not reported liabilities associated with property and casualty contracts of billion have been included using an estimate of the ultimate amount to be settled under the policies based upon historical payment patterns 
the ultimate amount to be paid under property and casualty contracts is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant  which may vary significantly from the liability or contractual obligation presented above especially as it relates to incurred but not reported liabilities 
all estimated cash payments presented in the table above are undiscounted as to interest  net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable 
the more than five years category displays estimated payments due for periods extending for more than years from the present date 

table of contents the sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the liability amount of billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to the time value of money  which accounts for at least of the difference  as well as differences in assumptions  most significantly mortality  between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date 
for the majority of the company s insurance operations  estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balance liabilities as presented in the table above are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes 
these cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under generally accepted accounting principles 
actual cash payments to policyholders may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments as presented in the table above due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments 
policyholder account balances include liabilities related to conventional guaranteed investment contracts  guaranteed investment contracts associated with formal offering programs  funding agreements  individual and group annuities  total control accounts  bank deposits  individual and group universal life  variable universal life and company owned life insurance 
included within policyholder account balances are contracts where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to policies where the company is currently making payments and will continue to do so  as well as those where the timing of the payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts involve payment obligations where the timing of future payments is uncertain and where the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death  or where the occurrence of the payment triggering event  such as a surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  is outside the control of the company 
the company has estimated the timing of the cash flows related to these contracts based on historical experience  as well as its expectation of future payment patterns 
excess interest reserves representing purchase accounting adjustments of million have been excluded from amounts presented in the table above as they represent an accounting convention and not a contractual obligation

other policyholder liabilities are comprised of other policyholder funds  policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation 
amounts included in the table above related to these liabilities are as follows a 
other policyholder funds includes liabilities for incurred but not reported claims and claims payable on group term life  long term disability  ltc and dental  policyholder dividends left on deposit and policyholder dividends due and unpaid related primarily to traditional life and group life and health  and premiums received in advance 
liabilities related to unearned revenue of billion have been excluded from the cash payments presented in the table above because they reflect an accounting convention and not a contractual obligation 
with the exception of policyholder dividends left on deposit  and those 
table of contents items excluded as noted in the preceding sentence  the contractual obligation presented in the table above related to other policyholder funds is equal to the liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
such amounts are reported in the less than one year category due to the short term nature of the liabilities 
contractual obligations on policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity 
b 
policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year on participating policies 
as such  the contractual obligation related to policyholder dividends payable is presented in the table above in the less than one year category at the amount of the liability presented in the consolidated balance sheet 
c 
the nature of the policyholder dividend obligation is described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long term projection of the performance of the closed block  management has reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability  if any  presented in the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category 
this was done to reflect the long duration of the liability and the uncertainty of the ultimate cash payment 
amounts presented in the table above for short term debt  long term debt  collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities differ from the balances presented on the consolidated balance sheet as the amounts presented in the table above do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments 
the amounts presented above also include interest on such obligations as described below 
short term debt consists of borrowings with original maturities of less than one year carrying fixed interest rates 
the contractual obligation for short term debt presented in the table above represents the amounts due upon maturity plus the related interest for the period from january  through maturity 
long term debt bears interest at fixed and variable interest rates through their respective maturity dates 
interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations through maturity 
interest on variable rate debt is computed using prevailing rates at december  and  as such  does not consider the impact of future rate movements 
long term debt also includes payments under capital lease obligations of million  million  million and million  in the less than one year  one to three years  three to five years and more than five years categories  respectively 
collateral financing arrangements bear interest at fixed and variable interest rates through their respective maturity dates 
interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations through maturity 
interest on variable rate debt is computed using prevailing rates at december  and  as such  does not consider the impact of future rate movements 
pursuant to these collateral financing arrangements  the holding company may be required to deliver cash or pledge collateral to the respective unaffiliated financial institutions 
see holding company global funding sources 
junior subordinated debt securities bear interest at fixed interest rates through their respective redemption dates 
interest was computed using the stated rates on the obligations through the scheduled redemption dates as it is the company s expectation that the debt will be redeemed at that time 
inclusion of interest payments on junior subordinated debt through the final maturity dates would increase the contractual obligation by billion 
the company has accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending and derivative transactions 
as the securities lending transactions expire within the next year or the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain  the return of the collateral has been included in the less than one year category in the table above

in the table above  the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration date of the commitment 
as it relates to commitments to lend funds to partnerships and under bank credit facilities  the company anticipates that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years  however  as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted  such obligations are presented in the less than one year category in the table

if the timing of any of the other liabilities is sufficiently uncertain  the amounts are included within the less than one year category 
the other liabilities presented in the table above differs from the amount presented in the consolidated balance sheet by billion due primarily to the exclusion of items such as minority interests  legal liabilities  pension and postretirement benefit obligations  taxes due other than income tax  unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest  accrued severance and employee incentive compensation and other liabilities such as deferred gains and losses 
such items have been excluded from the table above as they represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations 
the net funded status of the company s pension and other postretirement liabilities included within other liabilities has been excluded from the amounts presented in the table above 
rather  the amounts presented represent the discretionary contributions of million to be made by the company to the pension plan in and the discretionary contributions of million  based on the current year s expected gross benefit payments to participants  to be made by the company to the postretirement benefit plans during virtually all contributions to the pension and postretirement benefit plans are made by the insurance subsidiaries of the holding company with little impact on the holding company s cash flows 
excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest of million and million  respectively  for which the company cannot reliably determine the timing of payment 
current income tax payable is also excluded from the table 
see also off balance sheet arrangements 
separate account liabilities are excluded from the table above 
generally  the separate account owner  rather than the company  bears the investment risk of these funds 
the separate account assets are legally segregated and are not subject to the claims that arise out of any other business of the company 
net deposits  net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are fully offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders whose liability is reflected with the separate account liabilities 
separate account liabilities are fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets and are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets as prescribed by sop the company also enters into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these purchase obligations are not material to its consolidated results of operations or financial position at december  additionally  the company has agreements in place for services it conducts  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans  and capitalization 
intercompany transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation 
intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required

table of contents capital and surplus levels  has guaranteed certain contractual obligations or has agreed to provide  upon the occurrence of certain contingencies  reinsurance for such entity s insurance liabilities 
management anticipates that to the extent that these arrangements place significant demands upon the company  there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable the company to meet these demands 
see the holding company liquidity and capital uses support agreements 
litigation 
putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation  and claims and assessments against the company  in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein and those otherwise provided for in the company s consolidated financial statements  have arisen in the course of the company s business  including  but not limited to  in connection with its activities as an insurer  employer  investor  investment advisor and taxpayer 
further  state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations 
it is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide reasonable ranges of potential losses except as noted elsewhere herein in connection with specific matters 
in some of the matters referred to herein  very large and or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  are sought 
although in light of these considerations  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position  based on information currently known by the company s management  in its opinion  the outcome of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect 
however  given the large and or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
fair value 
the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity securities  equity securities  trading securities  short term investments  derivatives  and embedded derivatives along with their fair value hierarchy  are described and disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and investments 
unprecedented credit and equity market conditions have resulted in difficulty in valuing certain asset classes due to inactive or disorderly markets and less observable market data 
see extraordinary market conditions 
rapidly changing market conditions and less liquid markets could materially change the valuation of securities within our consolidated financial statements and period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
the ultimate value at which securities may be sold could differ significantly from the valuations reported within the consolidated financial statements and could impact our liquidity 
further  recent events have prompted accounting standard setters and law makers to study the definition and application of fair value accounting 
it appears likely that further disclosures regarding the application of  and amounts carried at  fair value will be required

based on management s analysis of its expected cash inflows from operating activities  the dividends it receives from subsidiaries  that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval and its portfolio of liquid assets and other anticipated cash flows  management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to enable the company to make payments on debt  make cash dividend payments on its common and preferred stock  pay all operating expenses  and meet its cash needs 
the nature of the company s diverse product portfolio and customer base lessens the likelihood that normal operations will result in any significant strain on liquidity 
consolidated cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by billion to billion for the year ended december  as compared to billion for the year ended december  cash flows from operations represent net income earned adjusted for non cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the net cash generated from operating activities is used to meet the company s liquidity needs  such as debt and dividend payments  and provides cash available for investing activities 
cash flows from operations are affected by the timing of receipt of premiums and other revenues as well as the payment of the company s insurance liabilities 
in cash flows from operations includes the impact of the company entering the mortgage origination and servicing business 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities increased by billion to billion for the year ended december  as compared to billion for the year ended december  primarily due to higher net investment income and premiums  fees and other revenues 
net cash provided by financing activities was billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
accordingly  net cash provided by financing activities increased by billion for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
in the company reduced securities lending activities in line with market conditions  which resulted in a decrease of billion in the cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program 
partially offsetting this decrease was a net increase of billion in policyholder account balances  which primarily reflected the company s increased level of funding agreements with the fhlb of ny and with metlife short term funding llc  an issuer of commercial paper see extraordinary market conditions and liquidity and capital sources global funding sources 
the company also experienced a billion increase in cash collateral received under derivatives transactions  primarily as a result of the improvement in estimated fair value of the derivatives 
the cash collateral received under derivatives transactions is invested in cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments  which partly explains the major increase in this category of liquid assets 
the company increased short term debt by billion in compared with a decrease of billion in  which primarily reflected new activity at metlife bank  which borrowed billion from the federal reserve bank of new york under the term auction facility and entered into billion of short term borrowing from the fhlb of ny in order to fund mortgage origination activity acquired by the company in and provide a cost effective substitute for cash collateral received in connection with securities lending 
in the net cash paid related to collateral financing arrangements was billion resulting from the incurrence of price returns  which compares to billion of cash provided by collateral financing arrangement transactions completed in  as market conditions in reduced the availability and attractiveness of such financing 
in  there was a net issuance of billion of long term debt and junior subordinated debentures  compared to a net issuance in of billion 
finally  in order to strengthen its capital base  in the company reduced its level of common stock repurchase activity by billion compared with only repurchasing billion of common stock in as compared to billion in and issued billion of stock compared with no issuance in the company also paid dividends on the preferred stock and common stock of billion which was comparable to the dividends paid in net cash provided by financing activities was billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
accordingly  net cash provided by financing activities decreased by billion for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily because cash collateral received in connection with securities lending activity and other transactions was a decrease in cash billion lower for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year where cash increased by billion due to an expansion of the securities lending program in in the company benefited from a billion increase in cash from the issuance of collateral financing arrangements as favorable opportunities to execute such transactions arose 
also in  cash provided by the company s debt financing program decreased to billion as compared to billion in the prior year from short term  long term and subordinated debt financings as the mixture and amount of debt was adjusted in line with the company s capital structure plans and market opportunities 
in addition  the company increased the common stock repurchase program to billion in as compared to the prior year of billion in order to accomplish the company s capital structure plans 
the company also paid dividends on its preferred stock and common stock of billion which was billion higher than prior year reflecting the increase in the common stock dividend 
the remaining decrease in cash was due to slightly lower net flows on policyholder account balances 
net cash used in investing activities was billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
accordingly  net cash used in investing activities decreased by billion for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the company reduced the level of cash available for investing activities in in order to significantly increase cash and cash equivalents as a liquidity cushion in response to the deterioration in securities markets in cash and cash equivalents increased billion at december  compared to the prior year

the holding company is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding 
these markets  which serve as cost effective sources of funds  are critical components of the holding company s liquidity and capital management 
decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs  prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure 
a disruption in the financial markets could limit the holding company s access to liquidity 
see extraordinary market conditions 
the holding company s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current high credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies 
management views its capital ratios  credit quality  stable and diverse earnings streams  diversity of liquidity sources and its liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining high credit ratings 
see the company capital rating agencies 
liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics  including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio  timing differences in short term cash flow obligations  access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on the holding company s liquidity 
liquidity and capital sources dividends 
the primary source of the holding company s liquidity is dividends it receives from its insurance subsidiaries 
the holding company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles 
the dividend limitation for us insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders as of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year 
statutory accounting practices  as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which the company conducts business  differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap 
the 
table of contents significant differences relate to the treatment of dac  certain deferred income tax  required investment reserves  reserve calculation assumptions  goodwill and surplus notes 
management of the holding company cannot provide assurances that the holding company s insurance subsidiaries will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the holding company in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends and that the applicable insurance departments will not disapprove any dividends that such insurance subsidiaries must submit for approval

in the fourth quarter of  micc declared and paid an ordinary dividend of million to the holding company 
in the third quarter of  mlic used its otherwise ordinary dividend capacity through a non cash dividend in conjunction with the rga split off as approved by the new york insurance commissioner 
under new york state insurance law  mlic is permitted  without prior insurance regulatory clearance  to pay stockholder dividends to the holding company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year  or ii its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year excluding realized capital gains

liquid assets 
an integral part of the holding company s liquidity management is the amount of liquid assets it holds 
liquid assets include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities 
liquid assets exclude cash collateral received under the company s securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities 
at december  and  the holding company had billion and billion in liquid assets  respectively

table of contents global funding sources 
liquidity is also provided by a variety of short term instruments  including commercial paper 
capital is provided by a variety of long term instruments  including medium and long term debt  junior subordinated debt securities  collateral financing arrangements  capital securities and stockholders equity 
the diversity of the holding company s funding sources enhances funding flexibility and limits dependence on any one source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds 
other sources of the holding company s liquidity include programs for short and long term borrowing  as needed 
during this extraordinary market environment  management is continuously monitoring and adjusting its liquidity and capital plans for the holding company and its subsidiaries in light of changing needs and opportunities 
the dislocation in the credit markets has limited the access of financial institutions to long term debt and hybrid capital 
while  in general  yields on benchmark us treasury securities were historically low during  related spreads on debt instruments  in general  and those of financial institutions  specifically  were as high as they have been in our history as a public company 
this shift resulted in a relative increase in the cost of new debt capital and new credit 
for example  in august  metlife remarketed senior unsecured debt with a ten year maturity at a coupon 
at december   the average coupon on ten year senior unsecured debt of the holding company  excluding the debt remarketed in august is  or less than that of the debt remarketed in august metlife has issued million in a single series of libor based preferred stock with a floor 
this series represents a small portion of metlife s fixed charges 
at current levels  libor would have to increase by basis points over increase to have any impact on the dividend for these preferred securities 
metlife amended and restated certain of its credit agreements in december these changes included increases in pricing for these agreements compared to the original rates 
in february  the holding company closed the successful remarketing of the series b portion of the junior subordinated debentures underlying the common equity units

goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach  which requires the use of estimates and judgment  at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment  if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level 
information regarding changes in goodwill is as follows december  in millions balance at beginning of the period  acquisitions other  net balance at the end of the period see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and dispositions for a description of acquisitions and dispositions 
consists principally of foreign currency translation adjustments 

table of contents information regarding goodwill by segment and reporting unit is as follows december  in millions institutional group life retirement savings non medical health other subtotal individual traditional life variable universal life annuities other subtotal international latin america region european region asia pacific region subtotal auto home corporate other total the allocation of the goodwill to the reporting units is performed at the time of the respective acquisition 
the million of goodwill within corporate other relates to goodwill acquired as a part of the travelers acquisition of million  as well as acquisitions by metlife bank which resides within corporate other 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing at december  and  million of corporate other goodwill has been attributed to the individual and institutional segment reporting units 
the individual segment was attributed million  traditional life million  variable universal life million and annuities million and the institutional segment was attributed million  group life million  retirement savings million  and non medical health other million at both december  and for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value  there is an indication of impairment  and the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill would be determined in a business acquisition 
the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill is recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests during the third quarter of based upon data as of june  such tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired as of september  current economic conditions  the sustained low level of equity markets  declining market capitalizations in the insurance industry and lower operating earnings projections  particularly for the individual segment  required management of the company to consider the impact of these events on the recoverability of its assets  in particular its goodwill 
management concluded it was appropriate to perform an interim goodwill impairment test at december  based upon the tests performed management concluded no impairment of goodwill had occurred for any of the company s reporting units at december  
table of contents in performing its goodwill impairment tests  when management believes meaningful comparable market data are available  the estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a market multiple approach 
when relevant comparables are not available  the company uses a discounted cash flow model 
for reporting units which are particularly sensitive to market assumptions  such as the annuities and variable universal life reporting units within the individual segment  the company may corroborate its estimated fair values by using additional valuation methodologies 
the key inputs  judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value include projected operating earnings  current book value with and without accumulated other comprehensive income  the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business  long term growth rates  comparative market multiples  the account value of our in force business  projections of new and renewal business as well as margins on such business  the level of interest rates  credit spreads  equity market levels  and the discount rate management believes appropriate to the risk associated with the respective reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of the annuity and variable universal life reporting units are particularly sensitive to the equity market levels 
when testing goodwill for impairment  management also considers its market capitalization in relation to its book value 
management believes that the overall decrease in the company s current market capitalization is not representative of a long term decrease in the value of the underlying reporting units 
management applies significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units and when assessing the relationship of its market capitalization to the estimated fair value of its reporting units and their book value 
the valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change 
estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
declines in the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial position 
management continues to evaluate current market conditions that may affect the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists 
continued deteriorating or adverse market conditions for certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result in future impairments of goodwill

unlike the pbo for pensions  the epbo is not recorded in the financial statements but is used in measuring the periodic expense 
the accumulated postretirement plan benefit obligation apbo represents the actuarial present value of future postretirement benefits attributed to employee services rendered through a particular date

r sfas  effective december  upon adoption  the company was required to recognize in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
funded status is measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation  which is the pbo for pension plans and the apbo for other postretirement benefit plans 
the change to recognize funded status eliminated the additional minimum pension liability provisions of sfas in addition  the company recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax  those amounts of actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs and credits  and the remaining net transition asset or obligation that had not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost at the date of adoption

some of the more significant of these assumptions include the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefit payments  the expected rate of compensation increases and average expected retirement age 
assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations were as follows december  weighted average discount rate rate of compensation increase average expected retirement age the discount rate is determined annually based on the yield  measured on a yield to worst basis  of a hypothetical portfolio constructed of high quality debt instruments available on the valuation date  which would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the aggregate pbo when due 
the yield of this hypothetical portfolio  constructed of bonds rated aa or better by moody s resulted in a discount rate of approximately and for the defined pension plans at december  and  respectively 

table of contents a decrease increase in the discount rate increases decreases the pbo 
this increase decrease to the pbo is amortized into earnings as an actuarial loss gain

at the end of  the average remaining service period of active employees was years for the pension plans 
the increase in net periodic benefit cost in associated with the amortization of these net actuarial losses is described in the respective section which follows 
as the benefits provided under the defined pension plans are calculated as a percentage of future earnings  an assumption of future compensation increases is required to determine the projected benefit obligation 
this assumption is based on a building block approach that best estimates future compensation increases due to inflation  merit and productivity 
the future compensation rate is derived from a consumer price index cpi assumption and through periodic analysis of historical demographic data conducted 
a recent review of these underlying assumptions demonstrated that the cpi assumption should be lowered by basis points based on forecasts from various economic reports 
the last review of the historical data was conducted using salary information through and the company believes that no circumstances have subsequently occurred that would result in a material change to the future compensation rate 
the basis point change in future compensation rate caused a decrease in pbo of million 
this rate is reviewed annually 
other postretirement benefit plan obligations the apbo is determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions  from which actual results may vary 
some of the more significant of these assumptions include the discount rate  the healthcare cost trend rate and the average expected retirement age 
the determination of the discount rate and the average expected retirement age are substantially consistent with the determination described previously for the pension plans 
the assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the apbo and net periodic benefit cost were as follows december  pre medicare eligible claims down to in and down to in and gradually decreasing until remaining constant thereafter reaching the ultimate rate of medicare eligible claims down to in and down to in and gradually decreasing until remaining constant thereafter reaching the ultimate rate of a recent review of the healthcare cost trend assumption indicated the need for a slight modification in this assumption as set forth in the table above 
this assumption change in our healthcare cost trend rate increased the apbo by million

the majority of assets are held in separate accounts established by the subsidiaries 
the account values of assets held with the subsidiaries were million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the terms of these contracts are consistent in all material respects with those the subsidiaries offer to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated 
the valuation of separate accounts and the investments within such separate accounts invested in by the other postretirement benefit plans are similar to that described in the preceding section on pension plans 

table of contents the following table summarizes the actual and target weighted average allocations of other postretirement benefit plan assets within the separate accounts december  weighted average weighted average actual allocation target allocation asset category equity securities fixed maturity securities other real estate and alternative investments total target allocations of assets are determined with the objective of maximizing returns and minimizing volatility of net assets through adequate asset diversification

credit and equity market volatility during resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of the other postretirement benefit plan s assets at december  this decline in asset values resulted in an increase in net actuarial losses at december   as described in the preceding section on other postretirement benefit plan obligations  and will result in a significant increase in net periodic other postretirement benefit plan cost during  as described in the following section on net periodic benefit cost 
pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit cost pension cost net periodic pension cost is comprised of the following i service cost service cost is the increase in the projected pension benefit obligation resulting from benefits payable to employees of the subsidiaries on service rendered during the current year 
ii interest cost on the liability interest cost is the time value adjustment on the projected pension benefit obligation at the end of each year 
iii expected return on plan assets expected return on plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated pension fund assets in a particular year 
iv amortization of prior service cost this cost relates to the increase or decrease to pension benefit cost for service provided in prior years due to amendments in plans or initiation of new plans 
as the economic benefits of these costs are realized in the future periods  these costs are amortized to pension expense over the expected service years of the employees 
v amortization of net actuarial gains or losses actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the actual experience and the expected experience on pension plan assets or projected pension benefit obligation during a particular period 
these gains and losses are accumulated and  to the extent they exceed of the greater of the projected pension benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets  they are amortized into pension expense over the expected service years of the employees 

table of contents the subsidiaries recognized pension expense of million in as compared to million in and million in the major components of net periodic pension cost described above were as follows years ended december  in millions service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of net actuarial gains losses amortization of prior service cost credit net periodic benefit cost the decrease in expense from to was primarily the result of an increase in the expected return on plan assets and a decrease in amortization of net actuarial losses resulting from the million contribution made in the increase in the interest cost resulted from the increase in the discount rate 
the decrease in expense from to was primarily the result of better than anticipated returns on plan assets in  coupled with the increase in the discount rate 
for pension expense  we anticipate an increase of approximately million due to poor plan asset performance as a result of the economic downturn of the financial markets 
the expected increase in expense can be attributed to lower expected return on assets and increased amortization of net actuarial losses 
the estimated net actuarial losses and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next year are million and million  respectively 
the weighted average discount rate used to calculate the net periodic pension cost was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the weighted average expected rate of return on pension plan assets used to calculate the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december   and was 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in which the plan invests  weighted by target allocation percentages 
anticipated future performance is based on long term historical returns of the plan assets by sector  adjusted for the subsidiaries long term expectations on the performance of the markets 
while the precise expected return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to year  the subsidiaries policy is to hold this long term assumption constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from the derived rate 
based on the december  asset balances  a basis point increase decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease increase in net periodic benefit cost of million for the pension plans 
other postretirement benefit plan cost the net periodic other postretirement benefit plan cost consists of the following i service cost service cost is the increase in the expected postretirement plan benefit obligation resulting from benefits payable to employees of the subsidiaries on service rendered during the current year 
ii interest cost on the liability interest cost is the time value adjustment on the expected postretirement benefit obligation at the end of each year 
iii expected return on plan assets expected return on plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated other postretirement fund assets in a particular year 

table of contents iv amortization of prior service cost this cost relates to the increase or decrease to other postretirement benefit plan cost for service provided in prior years due to amendments in plans or initiation of new plans 
as the economic benefits of these costs are realized in the future periods these costs are amortized to other postretirement benefit expense over the expected service years of the employees 
v amortization of net actuarial gains or losses actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the actual experience and the expected experience on other postretirement benefit plan assets or expected postretirement plan benefit obligation during a particular year 
these gains and losses are accumulated and  to the extent they exceed of the greater of the accumulated postretirement plan benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets  they are amortized into other postretirement benefit expense over the expected service years of the employees 
the subsidiaries recognized no other postretirement benefit expense in as compared to million in and million in the major components of net periodic other postretirement benefit plan cost described above were as follows years ended december  in millions service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of net actuarial gains losses amortization of prior service cost credit net periodic benefit cost the decrease in benefit cost from to primarily resulted from a change in the medicare integration methodology for certain retirees 
the decrease in benefit cost from to was due to primarily to increases in the discount rate and better than expected medical trend experience 
for postretirement benefit expense  we anticipate an increase of approximately million due to poor plan asset performance as a result of the economic downturn of the financial markets 
the expected increase in expense can be attributed to lower expected return on assets and increased amortization of net actuarial losses 
the estimated net actuarial losses and prior service credit for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next year are less than million and million  respectively 
the weighted average discount rate used to calculate the net periodic postretirement cost was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate the net other postretirement benefit plan cost for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in which the plan invests  weighted by target allocation percentages 
anticipated future performance is based on long term historical returns of the plan assets by sector  adjusted for the subsidiaries long term expectations on the performance of the markets 
while the precise expected return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to year  the subsidiaries policy is to hold this long term assumption constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from the derived rate 
based on the december  asset balances  a basis point increase decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease increase in net periodic benefit cost of million for the other postretirement benefit plans 

table of contents funding and cash flows of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations pension plan obligations it is the subsidiaries practice to make contributions to the qualified pension plans to comply with minimum funding requirements of erisa  as amended 
in accordance with such practice  no contributions were required for the years ended december  or no contributions will be required for the subsidiaries made a discretionary contribution of million to the qualified pension plans during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the subsidiaries did not make any discretionary contributions to the qualified pension plans 
the subsidiaries expect to make additional discretionary contributions of million in benefit payments due under the non qualified pension plans are funded from the subsidiaries general assets as they become due under the provision of the plans 
these payments totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these benefit payments are expected to be at approximately the same level in gross pension benefit payments for the next ten years  which reflect expected future service as appropriate  are expected to be as follows pension benefits in millions other postretirement benefit plan obligations other postretirement benefits represent a non vested  non guaranteed obligation of the subsidiaries and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits 
while the subsidiaries have partially funded such plans in advance  it has been the subsidiaries practice to primarily use their general assets  net of participants contributions  to pay postretirement medical claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets 
total payments equaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the subsidiaries expect to make contributions of million  net of participants contributions  towards the other postretirement plan obligations in as noted previously  the subsidiaries expect to receive subsidies under the prescription drug act to partially offset such payments 
gross other postretirement benefit payments for the next ten years  which reflect expected future service where appropriate  and gross subsidies to be received under the prescription drug act are expected to be as follows prescription gross drug subsidies net in millions 
table of contents insolvency assessments most of the jurisdictions in which the company is admitted to transact business require insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations  which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired  insolvent or failed insurers 
these associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer engaged 
some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 
assets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments are as follows december  in millions other assets premium tax offset for future undiscounted assessments premium tax offsets currently available for paid assessments receivable for reimbursement of paid assessments other liabilities insolvency assessments the company holds a receivable from the seller of a prior acquisition in accordance with the purchase agreement

effects of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates 
inflation in the united states has remained contained and been in a general downtrend for an extended period 
however  in light of recent and ongoing aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures by the us federal government and foreign governments  it is possible that inflation could increase in the future 
an increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways 
during inflationary periods  the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses 
inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials  potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs can not be passed through in our product prices 
inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in our auto home business  which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation 
if actual inflation exceeds the expectations we use in pricing our policies  the profitability of our auto home business would be adversely affected 
prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally  and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy  which could constrain overall economic activity  inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities

if a contract modification does not substantially change the contract  the dac amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are immediately expensed 
the adoption of sop and the related tpas resulted in a reduction to dac and voba on january  and an acceleration of the amortization period relating primarily to the company s group life and health insurance contracts that contain certain rate reset provisions

the impact of this change in accounting policy was not significant to the company s financial position or results of operations as of the date of adoption 
additionally  for awards granted after adoption  the company changed its policy from recognizing expense for stock based awards over the requisite service period to recognizing such expense over the shorter of the requisite service period or the period to attainment of retirement eligibility 
the pro forma impact of this change in expense recognition policy for stock based compensation is detailed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company presented tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options within operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows

under sfas r and sfas all business combinations whether full  partial or step acquisitions result in all assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at fair value  with limited exceptions 
acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed as incurred subsequent to the acquisition date 
the fair value of the purchase price  including the issuance of equity securities  is determined on the acquisition date 
certain acquired contingent liabilities are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies 
changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense 
noncontrolling interests formerly known as minority interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date and are presented as equity rather than liabilities 
when control is attained on previously noncontrolling interests  the previously held equity interests are remeasured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized 
purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are accounted for as equity transactions 
when control is lost in a partial disposition  realized gains or losses are recorded on equity ownership sold and the remaining ownership interest is remeasured and holding gains or losses are recognized 
the pronouncements are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and apply prospectively to business combinations after that date

the company s primary investment objective is to optimize  net of income tax  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the company is exposed to four primary sources of investment risk credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest  interest rate risk  relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates  liquidity risk  relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions  and market valuation risk 
the company manages risk through in house fundamental analysis of the underlying obligors  issuers  transaction structures and real estate properties 
the company also manages credit risk  market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation 
for real estate and agricultural assets  the company manages credit risk and market valuation risk through geographic  property type and product type diversification and asset allocation 
the company manages interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management strategies  product design  such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  and proactive monitoring and management of certain non guaranteed elements of its products  such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments 
the company also uses certain derivative instruments in the management of credit and interest rate risks 
current environment 
concerns over the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  geopolitical issues  energy costs  inflation and a declining real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward 
these factors  combined with declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic slowdown and with the national bureau of economic research having announced in the th quarter of an ongoing us recession that began in december as a result of the stress experienced by the global financial markets  the fixed income markets are experiencing a period of extreme volatility which has negatively impacted market liquidity conditions 
initially  the concerns on the part of market participants were focused on the sub prime segment of the mortgage backed securities market 
however  these concerns have since expanded to include a broad range of mortgage backed and asset backed and other fixed income securities  including those rated investment grade  the us and international credit and inter bank money markets generally  and a wide range of financial institutions and markets  asset classes and sectors 
securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and have fewer opportunities for disposal 
as a result of this unprecedented disruption and market dislocation  we have experienced both volatility in the valuation of certain investments and decreased liquidity in certain asset classes and  as such  have experienced an increase in certain level investments 
as demonstrated in fixed maturity securities available for sale fair value hierarchy  during we have experienced an increase in certain level investments which include less liquid fixed maturity securities and equity securities with very limited trading activity 
even some of our very high quality assets have been more illiquid for periods of time as a result of the recent challenging market conditions 
these market conditions have also lead to an increase in unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities in  particularly for residential and commercial mortgage backed  asset backed and corporate fixed maturity securities  and within the company s financial services industry fixed maturity and equity securities holdings

such amounts are included within interest credited to policyholder account balances 
other invested assets are principally comprised of free standing derivatives with positive estimated fair values and leveraged leases 
freestanding derivatives with negative estimated fair values are included within other liabilities

year ended december  compared with the year ended december  net investment income decreased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
excluding the impacts of discontinued operations and periodic settlement payments on derivatives instruments as described in notes and of the yield table presented above  net investment income decreased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
management attributes  million of this change to a decrease in yields  partially offset by an increase of  million due to growth in average invested assets 
average invested assets are calculated on the cost basis without unrealized gains and losses 
the decrease in net investment income attributable to lower yields was primarily due to lower returns on other limited partnership interests  real estate joint ventures  short term investments  fixed maturity securities  and mortgage loans partially offset by improved securities lending results 
the reduction in yields associated with other limited partnership interests were primarily due to the lack of liquidity and credit in the financial markets as well as unprecedented investor redemptions in an environment with steep declines in the public equity and debt markets 
the decrease in real estate joint ventures yields was primarily due to a slow down in lease and related sales activities in a period with declining property values as well as fund investment write downs 
the decrease in short term investment yields was primarily attributable to declines in short term interest rates 
the decrease in the fixed maturity securities yield was primarily due to lower yields on floating rate securities due to declines in short term interest rates and an increased allocation to lower yielding 
table of contents us treasuries  partially offset by improved securities lending results 
the decrease in yields associated with our mortgage loan portfolio was primarily attributable to lower prepayments on commercial mortgage loans and lower yields on variable rate loans due to declines in short term interest rates 
the decrease in net investment income attributable to lower yields was partially offset by increased net investment income attributable to an increase in average invested assets on an amortized cost basis  primarily within short term investments  other invested assets including derivatives  mortgage loans  other limited partnership interests  and real estate joint ventures 
investment outlook management anticipates that the significant volatility in the equity  credit and real estate markets will continue in which could continue to impact net investment income and the related yields on private equity funds  hedge funds and real estate joint ventures  included within our other limited partnerships and real estate and real estate joint venture portfolios 
further  in light of the current market conditions  liquidity will be reinvested in a prudent manner and invested according to our alm discipline in appropriate assets over time 
however  considering the continued  uncertain credit market conditions  management plans to continue to maintain a slightly higher than normal level of short term liquidity 
net investment income may be adversely affected if the reinvestment process occurs over an extended period of time due to challenging market conditions or asset availability 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  net investment income increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
excluding the impacts of discontinued operations and periodic settlement payments on derivatives instruments as described in notes and to the yield table presented above  net investment income increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
management attributes  million of this increase to growth in the average asset base and million to an increase in yields 
average invested assets are calculated on the cost basis without unrealized gains and losses 
the increase in net investment income attributable to higher yields was primarily due to higher returns on fixed maturity securities  other limited partnership interests excluding hedge funds  equity securities and improved securities lending results  partially offset by lower returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures  cash and short term investments  hedge funds and mortgage loans 
the improvement in yields associated with fixed maturity securities was due primarily to higher bond prepayment fees related to decreasing interest rates in the second half of and to a repositioning of the portfolio in during a rising interest rate environment 
the improvement in yields associated with other limited partnership interests  excluding hedge funds  was due primarily to a robust private equity market resulting in improved returns on equity based funds and increased distributions on cost basis funds 
the increase in equity securities yields is primarily related to increased earnings on the non redeemable preferred securities comprised of perpetual hybrid securities and higher dividend income on our common stock holdings 
the decrease in real estate and real estate joint ventures yields was primarily due lower income from the sale of the peter cooper and stuyvesant town properties in fourth quarter and reinvestment in real estate joint ventures and development funds with more variable income streams 
the decrease in yields for cash and short term investment was primarily attributable to declines in short term interest rates in the second half of the decrease in hedge fund yields was primarily due to increasing volatility in private equity markets in the latter half of  driven by economic uncertainty as reflected in credit and equity markets 
the decrease in yields associated with our mortgage loan portfolio was primarily attributable to lower prepayments on commercial mortgage loans as well as new loan production at lower yields due to the declines in interest rates in the second half of fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale fixed maturity securities consisted principally of publicly traded and privately placed fixed maturity securities  and represented and of total cash and invested assets at december  and  respectively

table of contents valuation of securities 
management is responsible for the determination of estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of publicly traded fixed maturity  equity and trading securities as well as short term investments is determined by management after considering one of three primary sources of information quoted market prices in active markets  independent pricing services  or independent broker quotations 
the number of quotes obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument 
generally we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and do obtain multiple prices for certain securities  but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy 
independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on inputs that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
such observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active  liquid markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market 
the market standard valuation methodologies utilized include discounted cash flow methodologies  matrix pricing or similar techniques 
the assumptions and inputs in applying these market standard valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  interest rates  credit standing of the issuer or counterparty  industry sector of the issuer  coupon rate  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  maturity  estimated duration  and management s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows 
when a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service  management will value the security primarily using independent non binding broker quotations 
independent non binding broker quotations utilize inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
senior management  independent of the trading and investing functions  is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies  including reviewing and approving new transaction types and markets  for ensuring that observable market prices and market based parameters are used for valuation wherever possible and for determining that judgmental valuation adjustments  if any  are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time 
management reviews its valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and ensures that any changes to valuation methodologies are justified 
the company gains assurance on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions  valuation methodologies  and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through various controls designed to ensure that the financial assets and financial liabilities are appropriately valued and represent an exit price 
the control systems and procedures include  but are not limited to  analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns  comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates  comparing fair value estimates to management s knowledge of the current market  reviewing the bid ask spreads to assess activity and ongoing confirmation that independent pricing services use  wherever possible  market based parameters for valuation 
management determines the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing sources or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data 
the company also follows a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of fair value 
if we conclude that prices received from independent pricing services are not reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value  we will seek independent non binding broker quotes or use an internally developed valuation to override these prices 
such overrides are classified as level despite the credit events prevalent in the current dislocated markets and reduced levels of liquidity at the end of  our internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value  which reflect our estimates of liquidity and non performance risks  compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services  did not produce material differences for the vast majority of our fixed maturity securities portfolio 
our estimates of liquidity and non performance risks are generally based on available market evidence and on what other market participants would use 
in absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
as a result  we generally continued to use the price provided by the independent pricing service under our normal pricing protocol and pricing overrides were not material 
as discussed in the fair value hierarchy below  during due to these conditions  we have experienced an increase in level securities holdings which include less liquid fixed maturity and equity securities  some with very limited trading activity 
even some of our very high quality invested assets have been more illiquid for periods of time as a result of the challenging market conditions 
the company uses the results of this analysis for classifying the estimated fair value of these instruments in level  or for example  management will review the estimated fair values received to determine whether corroborating evidence ie  similar observable positions and actual 
table of contents trades will support a level classification in the estimated fair value hierarchy 
security prices which cannot be corroborated due to relatively less pricing transparency and diminished liquidity will be classified as level for privately placed fixed maturity securities  the company determines the estimated fair value generally through matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques 
the discounted cash flow valuations rely upon the estimated future cash flows of the security  credit spreads of comparable public securities  and secondary transactions  as well as taking account of  among other factors  the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with privately placed debt securities 
the company has reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate sfas fair value hierarchy level for each of its securities 
based on the results of this review and investment class analyses  each instrument is categorized as level   or based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation methodologies 
while prices for certain us treasury and agency fixed maturity securities  certain foreign government fixed maturity securities  exchange traded common stock  and certain short term money market securities have been classified into level because of high volumes of trading activity and narrow bid ask spreads  most securities valued by independent pricing services have been classified into level because the significant inputs used in pricing these securities are market observable or can be corroborated using market observable information 
most investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities have been classified within level  while most below investment grade or distressed privately placed fixed maturity securities have been classified within level where estimated fair values are determined by independent pricing sources or by independent non binding broker quotations that utilize inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  these instruments have been classified as level use of independent non binding broker quotations generally indicates there is a lack of liquidity or the general lack of transparency in the process to develop these price estimates causing them to be considered level ratings 
the securities valuation office of the naic evaluates the fixed maturity investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns securities to one of six investment categories called naic designations 
the naic ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros for marketable bonds 
naic ratings and include bonds generally considered investment grade rated baa or higher by moody s or rated bbb or higher by s p and fitch  by such rating organizations 
naic ratings through include bonds generally considered below investment grade rated ba or lower by moody s  or rated bb or lower by s p and fitch

the pricing sources for these sectors are as follows at december  level fixed maturity securities are priced principally through independent broker quotations or market standard valuation methodologies using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
level fixed maturity securities consists of less liquid fixed maturity securities with very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation methodologies including below investment grade private placements and less liquid investment grade corporate securities included in us and foreign corporate securities and less liquid asset backed securities including securities supported by sub prime mortgage loans included in asset backed securities 
level non redeemable preferred securities include securities with very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation 
the change in level fixed maturity securities during the period was as follows during the year ended december   level fixed maturity securities decreased by  million or  due primarily to increased unrealized losses recognized in other comprehensive income loss and to a lesser extent sales and settlements in excess of purchases 
the increased unrealized losses in fixed maturity securities were concentrated in asset backed securities including residential mortgage backed securities backed by sub prime mortgage loans  us and foreign corporate securities and to a lesser extent commercial mortgage backed securities due to current market conditions including less liquidity and increased spreads for such securities 
net sales and settlements in excess of purchases of fixed maturity securities were concentrated in asset backed securities including residential mortgage backed securities backed by sub prime mortgage loans and us and foreign corporate securities

during the year ended december   fixed maturity securities transfers into level of  million resulted primarily from current market conditions characterized by a lack of trading activity  decreased liquidity  fixed maturity securities going into default  and ratings downgrades eg from investment grade to below investment grade 
these current market conditions have resulted in decreased transparency of valuations  and an increased use of broker quotations and unobservable inputs to determine fair value 
during the year ended december   fixed maturity securities transfers out of level of  million resulted primarily from increased transparency of both new issuances that subsequent to issuance and establishment of trading activity became priced by pricing services and existing issuances that  over time  the company was able to corroborate pricing received from independent pricing services with observable inputs

one of the criteria which the company considers in its other than temporary impairment analysis is its intent and ability to hold securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of their value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost 
the company s intent and ability to hold securities considers broad portfolio management objectives such as asset liability duration management  issuer and industry segment exposures  interest rate views and the overall total return focus 
in following these portfolio management objectives  changes in facts and circumstances that were present in past reporting periods may trigger a decision to sell securities that were held in prior reporting periods 
decisions to sell are based on current conditions or the company s need to shift the portfolio to maintain its portfolio management objectives including liquidity needs or 
table of contents duration targets on asset liability managed portfolios 
the company attempts to anticipate these types of changes and if a sale decision has been made on an impaired security and that security is not expected to recover prior to the expected time of sale  the security will be deemed other than temporarily impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an other than temporary impairment loss will be recognized

the fixed maturity and equity securities  each with a gross unrealized loss greater than million  increased billion during the year ended december  these securities were included in the regular evaluation of whether such securities are other than temporarily impaired 
based upon the company s current evaluation of these securities in accordance with its impairment policy  the cause of the decline being primarily attributable to a rise in market yields caused principally by an extensive widening of credit spreads which resulted from a lack of market liquidity and a short term market dislocation versus a long term deterioration in credit quality  and the company s current intent and ability to hold the fixed maturity and equity securities with unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient for them to recover  the company has concluded that these securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
in the company s impairment review process  the duration of  and severity of  an unrealized loss position  such as unrealized losses of or more for equity securities  which was million and million at december  and  respectively  is given greater weight and consideration  than for fixed maturity securities 
an extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments and the company s evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows  as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the security  including holding the security until the earlier of a recovery in value  or until maturity

there were no equity securities with an unrealized loss of or more for twelve months or greater 
in connection with the equity securities impairment review process during  the company evaluated its holdings in non redeemable preferred securities  particularly those of financial services industry companies 
the company considered several factors including whether there has been any deterioration in credit of the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of non redeemable preferred securities with a severe or an extended unrealized loss 
with respect to common stock holdings  the company considered the duration and severity of the securities in an unrealized loss position of or more  and the duration of the securities in an unrealized loss position of or less with an extended unrealized loss position ie months or more

also  the company believes the unrealized loss position is not necessarily predictive of the ultimate performance of these securities  and with respect to fixed maturity securities  it has the ability and intent to hold until the earlier of the recovery in value  or until maturity  and with respect to equity securities  it has the ability and intent to hold until the recovery in value 
future other than temporary impairments will depend primarily on economic fundamentals  issuer performance  changes in collateral valuation  changes in interest rates  and changes in credit spreads 
if economic fundamentals and other of the above factors continue to deteriorate  additional other than temporary impairments may be incurred in upcoming quarters

credit risk 
the company may be exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments 
generally  the current credit exposure of the company s derivative contracts is limited to the net positive estimated fair value of derivative contracts at the reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of netting agreements and any collateral received pursuant to credit support annexes 
the company manages its credit risk related to over the counter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties  maintaining collateral arrangements and through the use of master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination 
because exchange traded futures are effected through regulated exchanges  and positions are marked to market on a daily basis  the company has minimal exposure to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivative instruments 
the company enters into various collateral arrangements  which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in connection with its derivative instruments 
at december  and  the company was obligated to return cash collateral under its control of  million and million  respectively 
this unrestricted cash collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents or in short term investments and the obligation to return it is included in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions

at december  and  the company provided cash collateral for exchange traded futures of million and million  respectively  which is included in premiums and other receivables 
in connection with synthetically created investment transactions and credit default swaps held in relation to the trading portfolio  the company writes credit default swaps for which it receives a premium to insure credit risk 
if a credit event  as defined by the contract  occurs generally the contract will require the company to pay the counterparty the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the delivery of par quantities of the referenced credit obligation 
the company s maximum amount at risk  assuming the value of all referenced credit obligations is zero  was  million at december  however  the company believes that any actual future losses will be significantly lower than this amount 
additionally  the company can terminate these contracts at any time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an amount equal to the then current estimated fair value of the credit default swaps 
at december   the company would have paid million to terminate all of these contracts

however  we believe our actuarial liabilities for future benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to be paid to policyholders 
we periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience 
we revise estimates  to the extent permitted or required under gaap  if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities 
the company has experienced  and will likely in the future experience  catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism  and turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including pandemics  hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  tornadoes  explosions  severe winter weather including snow  freezing water  ice storms and blizzards  fires and man made events such as terrorist attacks 
due to their nature  we cannot predict the incidence  timing  severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism  but we make broad use of catastrophic and non catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils 
future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of expected future benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of expected future net premiums 
such liabilities are established 
table of contents based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits include mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumed and future losses are projected under loss recognition testing  then additional liabilities may be required  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims

table of contents variable annuity guarantees the company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefit that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit ie  the benefit base less withdrawals 
in some cases the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits  bonus amounts  accruals or market value resets 
these guarantees are accounted for under sop or as embedded derivatives under sfas depending on how and when the benefit is paid 
specifically  a guarantee is accounted for under sfas if a guarantee is paid without requiring i the occurrence of specific insurable event or ii the policyholder to annuitize 
alternatively  a guarantee is accounted for under sop if a guarantee is paid only upon either i the occurrence of a specific insurable event or ii upon annuitization 
in certain cases  a guarantee may have elements of both sfas and sop and in such cases the guarantee is accounted for under a split of the two models 
the net amount at risk nar for guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  increased equity volatility  or changes in interest rates 
the nar disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  represents management s estimate of the current value of the benefits under these guarantees if they were all exercised simultaneously as of december  and  respectively 
however  there are features  such as deferral periods and benefits requiring annuitization or death  that limit the amount of benefits that will be payable in the near future 
none of the gmib guarantees are eligible for a guaranteed annuitization prior to guarantees  including portions thereof  accounted for as embedded derivatives under sfas  are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances

in connection with this adjustment  gains of  million are included in the loss of  million in net investment gains losses 
the estimated fair value of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  equity volatility  interest rates or foreign exchange rates 
additionally  because the estimated fair value for guarantees accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for the company s own credit  a decrease in the company s credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to increase 
conversely  a widening of the company s credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to decrease 
the company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities 
the derivative instruments used are primarily equity and treasury futures  equity options and variance swaps  and interest rate swaps 
the change in valuation arising from the company s own credit is not hedged

guarantees  including portions thereof  accounted for under sop have liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits 
guarantees accounted for in this manner include gmdbs  the life contingent portion of certain gmwb  and the portion of gmib that require annuitization 
these liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns 
the scenarios use best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize deferred acquisition costs 
when current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected  the sop reserves will increase  resulting in a current period charge to net income 
the opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected 
at each reporting period  the company updates the actual amount of business remaining in force  which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings 
the table below contains the carrying value for guarantees included in future policy benefits december  in millions individual guaranteed minimum death benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit international guaranteed minimum death benefit total included in policyholder benefits and claims for the year ended december  is a charge of million related to the change in liabilities for the above guarantees 
the carrying amount of guarantees accounted for as sop liabilities can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  increased equity volatility  or changes in interest rates 
the company uses reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities 
derivative instruments used are primarily equity and treasury futures 
included in policyholder benefits and claims associated with the hedging of the guarantees in future policy benefits for the year ended december  were gains of million related to reinsurance treaties containing embedded derivatives carried at estimated fair value and gains of million related to freestanding derivatives 

table of contents while the company believes that the hedging strategies employed for guarantees included in both policyholder account balances and in future policy benefits  as well as other management actions  have mitigated the risks related to these benefits  the company remains liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay 
certain of the company s reinsurance agreements and derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements  both of which  significantly reduces the exposure to counterparty risk 
in addition  the company is subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality  combined with adverse market events  produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed 
lastly  because the valuation of the guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives includes an adjustment for the company s own credit that is not hedged  changes in the company s own credit may result in significant volatility in net income 
other policyholder funds other policyholder funds include policy and contract claims  unearned revenue liabilities  premiums received in advance  policyholder dividends due and unpaid  and policyholder dividends left on deposit 
the liability for policy and contract claims generally relates to incurred but not reported death  disability  long term care ltc and dental claims as well as claims that have been reported but not yet settled 
the liability for these claims is based on the company s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims 
the company derives estimates for the development of incurred but not reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of claims and claims development for each line of business 
the methods used to determine these estimates are continually reviewed 
adjustments resulting from this continuous review process and differences between estimates and payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and claims expense in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made 
the unearned revenue liability relates to universal life type and investment type products and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods 
the charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the product s estimated gross profits and margins  similar to deferred acquisition costs 
such amortization is recorded in universal life and investment type product policy fees 
also included in other policyholder funds are policyholder dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and policyholder dividends left on deposit 
such liabilities are presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders 
policyholder dividends payable policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year on participating policies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company must effectively manage  measure and monitor the market risk associated with its assets and liabilities 
it has developed an integrated process for managing risk  which it conducts through its enterprise risk management department  asset liability management unit  treasury department and investment department along with the management of the business segments 
the company has established and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level to minimize the effects of potential market volatility 

table of contents the company regularly analyzes its exposure to interest rate  equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
as a result of that analysis  the company has determined that the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities are materially exposed to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the equity markets 
enterprise risk management 
metlife has established several financial and non financial senior management committees as part of its risk management process 
these committees manage capital and risk positions  approve asset liability management strategies and establish appropriate corporate business standards 
metlife also has a separate enterprise risk management department  which is responsible for risk throughout metlife and reports to metlife s chief risk officer 
the enterprise risk management department s primary responsibilities consist of implementing a board of directors approved corporate risk framework  which outlines the company s approach for managing risk on an enterprise wide basis  developing policies and procedures for managing  measuring  monitoring and controlling those risks identified in the corporate risk framework  establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels  deploying capital on an economic capital basis  and reporting on a periodic basis to the finance and risk policy committee of the company s board of directors  and with respect to credit risk to the investment committee of the company s board of directors and various financial and non financial senior management committees 
metlife does not expect to make any material changes to its risk management practices in asset liability management alm 
the company actively manages its assets using an approach that balances quality  diversification  asset liability matching  liquidity  concentration and investment return 
the goals of the investment process are to optimize  net of income tax  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are reasonably managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the asset liability management process is the shared responsibility of the financial risk management and asset liability management unit  enterprise risk management  the portfolio management unit  and the senior members of the operating business segments and is governed by the alm committee 
the alm committee s duties include reviewing and approving target portfolios  establishing investment guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the asset liability management process on a periodic basis 
the directives of the alm committee are carried out and monitored through alm working groups which are set up to manage by product type 
metlife establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product  which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk 
these strategies are monitored through regular review of portfolio metrics  such as effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality by the alm working groups 
metlife does not expect to make any material changes to its asset liability management practices in market risk exposures the company has exposure to market risk through its insurance operations and investment activities 
for purposes of this disclosure  market risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes results most significantly from its holdings of fixed maturity securities  as well as its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities  all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term interest rates 
the interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include debt  policyholder account balances related to certain investment type contracts  and net embedded derivatives within liability host contracts which have the same type of 
table of contents interest rate exposure medium and long term interest rates as fixed maturity securities 
the company employs product design  pricing and asset liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate movements 
product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to reset credited rates for certain products 
asset liability management strategies include the use of derivatives and duration mismatch limits 
see risk factors changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar results from its holdings in non us dollar denominated fixed maturity and equity securities  mortgage and consumer loans  and certain liabilities  as well as through its investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the company s investment portfolios are the euro  the canadian dollar and the british pound 
the principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange risk in the company s liabilities are the british pound  the euro  the canadian dollar and the swiss franc 
selectively  the company uses us dollar assets to support certain long duration foreign currency liabilities 
through its investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures  the company is primarily exposed to the mexican peso  the japanese yen  the south korean won  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the chilean peso  the australian dollar  the argentine peso and the hong kong dollar 
in addition to hedging with foreign currency swaps  forwards and options  in some countries  local surplus is held entirely or in part in us dollar assets which further minimizes exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
the company has matched much of its foreign currency liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets  thereby reducing its risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 
equity prices 
the company has exposure to equity prices through certain liabilities that involve long term guarantees on equity performance such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefit riders  certain policyholder account balances along with investments in equity securities 
we manage this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our asset liability management strategies including the dynamic hedging of certain variable annuity riders 
the company also manages equity price risk incurred in its investment portfolio through the use of derivatives 
equity exposures associated with other limited partnership interests are excluded from this section as they are not considered financial instruments under generally accepted accounting principles 
management of market risk exposures the company uses a variety of strategies to manage interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risk  including the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk management 
to manage interest rate risk  the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models  including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the company s in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
the new york state insurance department regulations require that metlife perform some of these analyses annually as part of metlife s review of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves 
for several of its legal entities  the company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of asset liability management and the allocation of investment income to product lines 
for each segment  invested assets greater than or equal to the gaap liabilities less the dac asset and any non invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained  with any excess swept to the surplus segment 
the operating segments may reflect differences in legal entity  statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration  liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets 
certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities 
the company measures relative sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing company models 
these models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage prepayments and defaults 

table of contents common industry metrics  such as duration and convexity  are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates 
in computing the duration of liabilities  consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how the company intends to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends 
each asset portfolio has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio 
where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets  as is the case with certain retirement and non medical health products  the company may support such liabilities with equity investments  derivatives or curve mismatch strategies 
foreign currency exchange rate risk management 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is assumed primarily in three ways investments in foreign subsidiaries  purchases of foreign currency denominated investments in the investment portfolio and the sale of certain insurance products 
the company s treasury department is responsible for managing the exposure to investments in foreign subsidiaries 
limits to exposures are established and monitored by the treasury department and managed by the investment department 
the investment department is responsible for managing the exposure to foreign currency investments 
exposure limits to unhedged foreign currency investments are incorporated into the standing authorizations granted to management by the board of directors and are reported to the board of directors on a periodic basis 
the lines of business are responsible for establishing limits and managing any foreign exchange rate exposure caused by the sale or issuance of insurance products 
metlife uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments  its equity exposure in subsidiaries and its foreign currency exposures caused by the sale of insurance products 
equity price risk management 
equity price risk incurred through the issuance of variable annuities is managed by the company s asset liability management unit in partnership with the investment department 
equity price risk is also incurred through its investment in equity securities and is managed by its investment department 
metlife uses derivatives to hedge its equity exposure both in certain liability guarantees such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefit riders and equity securities 
these derivatives include exchange traded equity futures  equity index options contracts and equity variance swaps 
the company s derivative hedges performed effectively through the extreme movements in the equity markets during the latter part of the company also employs reinsurance to manage these exposures 
hedging activities 
metlife uses derivative contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and equity risk 
derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on accounting results and gaap and statutory capital 
the construction of the company s derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged 
some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets 
the company s use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows risks related to living benefit riders the company uses a wide range of derivative contracts to hedge the risk associated with variable annuity living benefit riders 
these hedges include equity and interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  currency futures forwards  equity indexed options and interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps 
minimum interest rate guarantees for certain company liability contracts  the company provides the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate 
these contracts include certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities 
the company purchases interest rate floors to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantees 
reinvestment risk in long duration liability contracts derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long duration liability contracts  such as long term care 
hedges include zero coupon interest rate swaps and swaptions 

table of contents foreign currency risk the company uses currency swaps and forwards to hedge foreign currency risk 
these hedges primarily swap foreign denominated bonds or equity exposures to us dollars 
general alm hedging strategies in the ordinary course of managing the company s asset liability risks  the company uses interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floors and inflation swaps 
these hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows 
risk measurement sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing the analysis summarized below  the company used market rates at december  the sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of the company s market risk exposures interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate relating to its trading and non trading assets and liabilities 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of its market sensitive assets and liabilities as follows the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the us dollar equivalent estimated fair values of the company s foreign currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates  and the estimated fair value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity market prices 
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance 
the company cannot ensure that its actual losses in any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages  the derivatives that qualify as hedges  the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values  the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the year 
accordingly  the company uses such models as tools and not as substitutes for the experience and judgment of its management 
based on its analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  metlife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity exposures 

table of contents the table below illustrates the potential loss in estimated fair value for each market risk exposure of the company s market sensitive assets and liabilities at december  december  in millions non trading interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk equity price risk trading interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk

this quantitative measure of risk has decreased by million  or approximately  to  million at december  from  million at december  from december  to december  there was a decline in interest rates across both the swaps and treasury curves which resulted in a decrease in the interest rate risk by  million 
in addition  the interest rate risk declined by million due to a reduction in the asset base and by million due to the completion of the company s split off of its ownership in rga 
a change in the method of estimating the fair value of liabilities in connection with the adoption of sfas further reduced the interest rate risk by million 
partially offsetting the decline was an increase in the interest rate risk from the use of derivatives employed by the company by  million  primarily related to financial futures and interest rate swaps 
changes in the duration of the company s portfolio also attributed  million to partially offset the decline in interest rate risk 
the inclusion of certain reinsurance recoverables within premiums and other receivables also increased the interest rate risk by million 
the remainder of the fluctuation is attributable to numerous immaterial items 
in addition to the analysis above  as part of its asset liability management program  the company also performs an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates  including both insurance liabilities and financial instruments 
at december   a hypothetical instantaneous decrease in interest rates applied to the company s liabilities  insurance and associated asset portfolios would reduce the estimated fair value of equity by million
