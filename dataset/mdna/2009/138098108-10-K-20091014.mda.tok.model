included in all other reporting segment 
specialty packaging specialty packaging and thermal control products  as well as related compliance training  for the transport of infectious and biological specimens and thermally sensitive pharmaceutical  medical and other products 
included in all other reporting segment 
most of our equipment  consumables and supplies are used to help prevent or control the occurrence or spread of infections 
significant activity i net income increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal despite sales growth of only 
we continue to benefit from having a broad portfolio of infection prevention and control products sold into diverse business segments and we have proactively developed our overall business to where approximately of our consolidated net sales are consumable products and service 
our four largest business segments  which include water purification and filtration  healthcare disposables  dialysis and endoscope reprocessing each performed extremely well and contributed the vast majority of the increase to net income in fiscal the primary factors that contributed to this financial performance  as further described elsewhere in this md a  were as follows improved gross margins as a result of numerous profit improvement and sales and marketing initiatives and the continued shift in sales mix to higher margin disposables  realization of price increases  reductions in manufacturing  raw material and distribution costs  general company wide efforts to control operating expenses while still investing in sales  marketing and research and development activities  an increase in demand for healthcare disposables products principally in our fourth quarter as a result of the outbreak of the novel hn flu swine flu  and favorable interest costs due to both reduced average interest rates as well as lower outstanding borrowings 
however  we cannot provide assurances that this level of growth can continue to be achieved  especially given the economic downturn  uncertainty surrounding the severity of the novel hn flu outbreak and other potential risks or uncertainties 
see risk factors elsewhere in this form k 
ii we sell our dialysis products to a concentrated number of customers 
sales in our dialysis segment were adversely impacted by continued loss of some low margin dialysate concentrate business from domestic customers as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for such product  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
additionally  although international concentrate sales were very strong in fiscal  we cannot provide assurances that the current level of concentrate sales to international customers will be sustained 
iii the deterioration in the economy and credit markets adversely impacted our sales in fiscal compared with fiscal by causing some of our customers to delay spending on certain products  especially capital equipment in our endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration segments  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
sales of capital equipment represent approximately of our overall consolidated net sales and are included in our water purification and filtration  dialysis and endoscope reprocessing segments 
iv in june  we announced and began executing our plan to restructure our netherlands manufacturing operations as part of our continuing effort to reduce operating costs and leverage our existing united states infrastructure 
as a result of this restructuring  approximately  and  of restructuring costs were recorded in fiscals and  respectively  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by in each of fiscals and  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
v fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an overall favorable impact on our net income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  despite the adverse impact on net sales  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
vi in july  we extended the life of certain out of the money stock options previously awarded to certain executive officers 
as a result  approximately  of additional stock based compensation expense was recorded in fiscal  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
vii effective april   our former president and chief executive officer resigned and our chief operating officer and executive vice president was promoted to president 
as a result of this resignation  a charge of approximately  primarily relating to separation benefits was recorded  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately in fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
viii fiscal acquisition we acquired the business of gem water systems int l  llc gem on july   as more fully described in business fiscal acquisition and note to the consolidated financial statements 
ix fiscal acquisitions we acquired the businesses of dialysis services  inc dsi on august   verimetrix  llc verimetrix on september   and strong dental products  inc strong dental on september   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
x fiscal acquisitions we acquired ge water process technologies water dialysis business the ge water acquisition or ge water on march  and the business of twist it inc twist on july   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the results of operations reflect the continuing operating results of cantel and its wholly owned subsidiaries  but exclude the operating results of carsen group inc carsen  which is reported as a discontinued operation for all years presented 
the olympus distribution agreements with carsen  as well as carsen s active business operations  terminated on july   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the ge water and twist acquisitions were completed on march  and july   respectively  their results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscals and and the portion of fiscal subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
since the dsi  verimetrix and strong dental acquisitions were completed on august   september  and september   respectively  their results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscal and the portion of fiscal subsequent to their respective acquisition dates and are not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal the acquisitions of dsi  verimetrix and strong dental had an overall insignificant effect on our results of operations for fiscal and the portion of fiscal subsequent to their respective acquisition dates due to the small size of these businesses 
since the gem acquisition was completed on the last day of fiscal  its results of operations are not reflected in our results of operations for any years presented 
for fiscal compared with fiscal  discussion herein of our pre existing business refers to all of our reporting segments with the exception of the operating results of the ge water acquisition included in our water purification and filtration reporting segment 
the following table gives information as to the net sales from continuing operations and the percentage to the total net sales from continuing operations for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands water purification and filtration healthcare disposables dialysis endoscope reprocessing all other fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales were adversely impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales  primarily of our water purification and filtration operating segment  using a weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
the increase in net sales in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of healthcare disposables products  endoscope reprocessing products and services  water purification and filtration products and services and therapeutic filtration products included in all other  partially offset by a decrease in dialysis products 
net sales of healthcare disposables products increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal despite negative growth in the overall dental market  primarily due to i increased sales volume of high margin face masks  disinfectants and other healthcare disposables products due to the outbreak of the novel hn flu swine flu in april  ii approximately  in higher net sales due to an increase in selling prices  which were implemented to offset corresponding supplier cost increases  iii the adverse impact on the first quarter of fiscal due to the consolidation of certain distributors of our dental products during resulting in the rationalization of duplicate inventories of the consolidated companies and iv approximately  in incremental net sales in the first quarter of fiscal due to the acquisition of strong dental during the first quarter of fiscal although the outbreak of the novel hn flu has resulted in strong sales volume during our fourth quarter of high margin face masks and other healthcare disposables products  we cannot provide assurances that such increased sales levels can be sustained throughout fiscal since such demand is highly dependent upon the severity and timing of the novel hn flu  the ability of our company to educate existing customers and potential new customers on the benefits of our face masks  disinfectants and other products and the level of urgency our customers and the general public develop and maintain with respect to epidemic and pandemic preparedness 
net sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the increase in demand in the united states for our disinfectants and product service due to the increased field population of equipment as well as our ability to gradually convert the sale of such items from our former equipment distributor who continued to purchase high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables from us and provide product service to our customers to our direct sales and service force at higher selling prices  ii higher selling prices  most of which relates to the direct sale of disinfectants  consumables and product service  which resulted in approximately  in incremental net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal  and iii approximately  in incremental net sales in the first quarter of our fiscal due to the acquisition of verimetrix during the first quarter of fiscal partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment in fiscal as a result of delayed spending on such investments due to the recent deterioration in the general economy and credit markets  which may continue to adversely affect future equipment sales 
net sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to i an increase in demand during fiscal for our sterilants and filters by pharmaceutical companies and within our installed equipment base of business  including one of our largest customers who standardized on our consumable products in their ordering system utilized by their dialysis clinics and ii higher selling prices  which offset increased manufacturing costs and favorably impacted net sales in fiscal by approximately  partially offsetting these increases were delayed investments during fiscal by customers of our water purification equipment used for dialysis as well as for commercial and industrial large capital applications as a result of the deterioration in the general economy and credit markets  which may continue to adversely affect capital equipment sales  and an  decrease in sales due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales using a weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  an increase of  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in sales was primarily due to increases in both international and domestic demand for our hemoconcentrator products filtration devices used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery and hemofilter products filtration devices that perform a slow  continuous blood filtration therapy used to control fluid overload and acute renal failure in unstable  critically ill patients who cannot tolerate the rapid filtration rates of conventional hemodialysis 
increases in selling prices of our therapeutic filtration products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales of dialysis products and services decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to i the continuing adverse impact of previously losing some dialysate concentrate business a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment from domestic customers as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for this low margin commodity product  and ii a decrease in net sales of low margin dialysis reuse supplies 
due to sales price decreases by some of our competitors  we expect a continued decrease in net sales of our low margin dialysate concentrate product in fiscal as we elect not to pursue unprofitable concentrate sales 
furthermore  fresenius medical care fresenius  the largest dialysis provider chain in the united states  manufactures dialysate concentrate themselves and has been gradually decreasing their purchases of that product from us and may continue to do so in fiscal additionally  we cannot provide assurances that the level of concentrate sales to international customers will be sustained 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher selling prices  which favorably impacted net sales in fiscal by approximately  to partially offset higher manufacturing and shipping costs  including freight invoiced to customers related costs of a similar amount are included within cost of sales 
net sales contributed by the specialty packaging operating segment were  in fiscal  a decrease of compared with fiscal this decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased customer demand in the united states for our specialty packaging products due to changes in regulatory requirements  increased competition and a decrease in clinical trials by our customers primarily due to the deterioration in the general economy 
increases in selling prices of our specialty packaging products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal increased compared with fiscal primarily due to i favorable sales mix due to the increased sales volume of certain high margin products such as disinfectants and consumables in our endoscope reprocessing segment  face masks and sterilization accessories in our healthcare disposables segment  and sterilants and filters in our water purification and filtration segment  as well as decreased sales of our low margin dialysate concentrate product in our dialysis segment  ii higher selling prices including those attributable to our ability to gradually convert the sale of high level disinfectants  cleaners  and consumables in our endoscope reprocessing segment from our former equipment distributor to our direct sales and service force at higher selling prices  iii a decrease in raw material and distribution costs in all our segments due to the lower price of fuel and oil  iv improved efficiencies in our manufacturing  distribution and service functions and v inefficiencies in our water purification and filtration segment during the three months ended october  as a result of the integration of the acquired ge water process technologies water dialysis business into our facilities 
however  we cannot provide assurances that this gross profit percentage can be sustained  especially if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement price increases or we experience a significant change in sales mix away from higher margin products 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily due to i higher compensation expense relating to annual salary increases and incentive compensation in all of our reporting segments and additional sales personnel primarily in our water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables segments and ii an increase of approximately  in advertising and marketing expense primarily related to our healthcare disposables segment 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately  as a result of translating selling expenses of our international subsidiaries using a weaker canadian dollar and euro against the united states dollar 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal general and administrative expenses were  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased principally due to i the prior year inclusion of approximately  in separation benefits and other costs related to the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer on april   ii a decrease in overhead at our netherlands operation due to the completion of restructuring activities  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  iii a decrease of approximately  as a result of foreign exchange gains associated with translating certain foreign denominated assets into functional currencies and the translation of general and administrative expenses of our international subsidiaries using a significantly weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar  and iv a decrease of  in amortization expense of intangible assets 
these decreases were offset by an increase in compensation expense primarily related to annual salary increases and incentive compensation in all of our locations and an increase of approximately  in stock based compensation expense including a  charge in july to extend the life of certain out of the money stock options previously awarded to certain executive officers  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs were  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal  is primarily due to increased development work on certain new products as well as continuing engineering on existing products primarily in our water purification and filtration  endoscope reprocessing and therapeutic filtration segments 
interest interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to decreases in average outstanding borrowings and average interest rates  partially offset by a  charge relating to the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of an interest rate cap agreement  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in average interest rates 
income from continuing operations before taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the improved gross profit percentage on increased sales as well as lower interest expense  as further explained above 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and in fiscals and  respectively 
the consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was affected principally by the geographic mix of pre tax income  repatriation of cash from our foreign subsidiaries and the impact of various tax rate changes  as described below 
the majority of our income from continuing operations before income taxes was generated from our united states operations  which had an overall effective tax rate of and in fiscals and  respectively 
the increase in our united states effective tax rate in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was due to an increase in our federal tax rate to and additional taxes relating to the repatriation of approximately  in earnings from our subsidiaries in canada and the netherlands  partially offset by recently enacted federal tax legislation that enabled us to claim the research and experimentation tax credit as well as new york state tax rate reductions enacted in  which primarily relate to our healthcare disposables segment 
such new york state tax rate reductions had a significant favorable effect on our fiscal effective tax rate in the year of enactment 
approximately of our fiscal income from continuing operations before income taxes was generated from our canadian operations  which had an overall effective tax rate in fiscals and of and  respectively 
overall statutory tax rates in canada are significantly below comparable rates in the united states 
additionally  the low overall effective tax rate in fiscal was attributable to the impact of a lower overall effective rate in our specialty packaging segment due to recently enacted rate reductions as applied to existing deferred income tax liabilities 
due to the uncertainty of our netherlands subsidiary utilizing tax benefits in the future  a tax benefit was not recorded on the losses from operations at our netherlands subsidiary in fiscals and  thereby adversely affecting our overall consolidated effective tax rate 
the overall loss from our netherlands operation in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal as a result of the restructuring of its operations  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations for our subsidiaries in japan and singapore did not have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate in fiscals and due to the size of these operations relative to our united states  canada and netherlands operations 
however  during fiscal  we decided to place a full valuation allowance against the nols of our japanese subsidiary  which resulted in the recording of tax expense on the past losses of our subsidiary in japan 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the majority of our unrecognized tax benefits originated from acquisitions 
accordingly  any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions have been recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill 
on august   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which requires the resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions to be recognized in our results of operations beginning with fiscal however  if our unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements in future periods  there would not be a significant impact to our effective tax rate due to the size of the unrecognized tax benefits in relation to our income from continuing operations before income taxes 
we do not expect such unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase in the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits on august  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  generally  the company is no longer subject to federal  state or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years ended prior to july our policy is to record potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense and general and administrative expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
however  such amounts have been relatively insignificant due to the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation the following table shows the income statement components of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax the above stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by  and in fiscals  and  respectively and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the related income tax benefits which pertain only to stock awards and options that do not qualify as incentive stock options were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities or a reduction to income taxes payable  depending on the timing of the deduction  and a reduction to income tax expense 
on july   we extended the life of  fully vested out of the money stock options previously awarded to certain executive officers seven individuals in total under our employee stock option plan 
such options were scheduled to expire within six months after july  and had exercise prices ranging from to  which were greater than the closing price of on july   the date the compensation committee of our board of directors authorized the modification 
the sole modification was to extend the options expiration dates to january  all other terms and conditions of the stock options remain the same 
as a result of this modification  approximately  in additional stock based compensation expense was recorded in our consolidated financial statements on july   which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share by 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  assumptions used in determining fair value  expected lives and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which is expected to be  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
most of our stock option and stock awards which consist only of restricted shares are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of tax  related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards which are expected to vest was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
if certain criteria are met when options are exercised or restricted stock becomes vested  the company is allowed a deduction on its income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as additional paid in capital and as a reduction of income taxes payable 
in fiscals and  options exercised and the vesting of restricted stock resulted in income tax deductions that reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively 
we classify the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense including tax benefits on stock compensation expense that has only been reflected in past pro forma disclosures relating to fiscal years prior to august  which was determined based upon the award s fair value 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal net sales contributed by the ge water acquisition in fiscal and were  and  respectively 
net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of euro net sales primarily of our endoscope reprocessing and dialysis operating segments using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales primarily of our water purification and filtration operating segment using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
although net sales in all of our reporting segments increased in fiscal  the increase in net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services and water purification and filtration products and services 
net sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to i an increase in demand for our endoscope disinfection equipment and disinfectants both internationally and in the united states and product service in the united states  ii approximately  in incremental net sales in fiscal due to the acquisition of verimetrix on september  and iii approximately  in higher net sales due to an increase in selling prices of our medivators endoscope reprocessing equipment and related products and service in the united states as a result of selling directly to our customers and not through a distributor 
beginning in our second quarter of fiscal  we commenced the sale of equipment directly to our customers in the united states 
although this distributor continued to purchase high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables from us and provide product service to our customers during fiscals and  we have been gradually converting the sale of such items to our direct sales and service force at higher selling prices 
the increase in demand for our disinfectants and product service is also attributable to the increased field population of equipment and our ability to convert users of competitive disinfectants to our products 
net sales of water purification and filtration products and services from our pre existing business increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to an increase in demand for our water purification equipment from dialysis customers as well as an increase in service revenue from the improved density and efficiency of our pre existing service delivery network partially due to recent acquisitions 
this increase was partially offset in fiscal by a decrease in commercial and industrial large capital equipment sales as a result of i our decision made in early fiscal to refocus our efforts on selling large capital equipment with standardized designs instead of customized designs that have historically provided lower profitability and ii delayed investments in capital equipment by customers due to the softening of the united states economy 
increases in selling prices of our water purification products and services did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal with respect to ge water  which is excluded from the above discussion of our pre existing business  average quarterly sales of water purification and filtration products and services in fiscal were approximately higher when compared with the post acquisition period ended july   due to improved sales opportunities within the installed equipment base of business as a result of combining ge water with our pre existing water purification and filtration business 
net sales of dialysis products and services increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to i increased demand during the first nine months of fiscal from customers  both in the united states and internationally  for dialysate concentrate a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment and ii higher selling prices primarily on dialysate concentrate  including freight invoiced to customers related costs of a similar amount are included within cost of sales  to partially offset increased manufacturing and shipping costs 
this increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of approximately  or  in net sales of dialysate concentrate during the three months ended july   compared with the three months ended july   due to the loss of some dialysate concentrate business as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for this low margin commodity product 
net sales of healthcare disposable products increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to i an increase in demand during the second half of fiscal for our instrument sterilization pouches  cups  towels and face mask products  ii approximately  in incremental net sales in fiscal due to the acquisitions of strong dental on september  and twist on july  and iii approximately  in higher net sales due to an increase in selling prices 
such selling price increases were implemented to offset corresponding supplier cost increases and therefore did not have a significant impact on gross profit 
partially offsetting these increases in net sales were i a high level of demand during the first three months of fiscal for face mask products due to a heightened awareness of avian flu prevention and ii distributors of our dental products had undergone consolidation during  which has adversely impacted sales of our healthcare disposables segment in fiscal due to the loss of some private label business  and with respect to the first three months of fiscal and our fourth quarter of fiscal  rationalization of duplicate inventories in the consolidated companies 
net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  an increase of  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in sales in fiscal was primarily due to the recommencement in february of sales of filters manufactured by us on an oem basis for a single customer s hydration system 
this customer had previously experienced a voluntary recall of the system unrelated to our product and was not purchasing filters until their sales of hydration systems recommenced 
increases in selling prices of our therapeutic filtration products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales contributed by the specialty packaging operating segment were  a decrease of  in fiscal compared with fiscal this decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased customer demand in the united states for our compliance training products due to the timing of orders relating to the government mandated two year compliance certification period  partially offset by increases in selling prices of approximately  gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by the ge water acquisition in fiscal and for the four month period ended july  since the date of the acquisition was  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales of our pre existing business in fiscals and was and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the ge water acquisition in fiscal and for the four month period ended july  since the date of the acquisition was and  respectively 
the gross profit percentage of our pre existing business in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal primarily due to i a change in sales mix  including increases in sales of renalin sterilant to large national chains that typically receive more favorable pricing  and lower margin water purification services  and with respect to the first six months of fiscal a decrease in sales of certain higher margin healthcare disposables products such as face masks  ii an increase in raw material  manufacturing and shipping costs in all of our operating segments  iii unabsorbed manufacturing overhead due to the decrease in commercial and industrial large capital equipment sales in our water purification and filtration segment  iv inefficiencies in our water purification and filtration segment as a result of the integration of the ge water acquisition into our pre existing business  which is now complete  and v approximately  in restructuring charges recorded primarily in our endoscope reprocessing segment in our fourth quarter of fiscal relating to the relocation of our netherlands manufacturing operations  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in gross profit percentage in our endoscope reprocessing segment as a result of selling our medivators brand endoscope reprocessing equipment and related products and service directly to customers through our own united states field sales and service organization instead of through a distributor as was done during a significant portion of the first three months of fiscal additionally  although this distributor continued to purchase high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables from us and provide product service to our customers during fiscals and  we have been gradually converting the sale of such high margin items to our direct sales and service force resulting in an increase in gross profit percentage 
with respect to ge water  which is excluded from the above discussion of our pre existing business  the gross profit percentage of water purification and filtration products and services decreased to approximately in fiscal from for the four months ended july  since the date of the acquisition due to increased manufacturing costs 
with respect to the increase in the amount of gross profit as opposed to the discussion of gross profit percentage  increases in net sales as explained above constitute the most significant factor in the increase in gross profit 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to higher compensation expense of approximately  including travel costs primarily relating to increased commissions on increased sales by our endoscope reprocessing direct sales network and additional headcount resulting from the ge water acquisition  an increase of approximately  in advertising and marketing expense primarily related to our healthcare disposables segment  and an increase of approximately  as a result of translating selling expenses of our international subsidiaries using a significantly stronger canadian dollar and euro against the united states dollar 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal increases in selling expenses as explained above constitute the most significant factor in the higher selling expense as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to an increase of approximately  in compensation expense due to additional headcount in our water purification and filtration segment  annual salary increases  severance expense related to the relocation of our medivators manufacturing operations from the netherlands to the united states and incentive compensation relating to the dsi  verimetrix and strong dental acquisitions  an increase of  in amortization expense of intangible assets primarily relating to our acquisitions of ge water  twist  dsi  verimetrix and strong dental  the inclusion of approximately  in estimated separation benefits and other costs related to the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer on april   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  an increase in stock based compensation expense of  and an increase of approximately  as a result of foreign exchange losses associated with translating certain foreign denominated assets into functional currencies as well as the translation of general and administrative expenses of our international subsidiaries using a significantly stronger canadian dollar and euro against the united states dollar 
partially offsetting these increases was the non reoccurrence of  in incentive compensation directly related to the ge water acquisition  which was incurred during the three months ended april  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs were  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
the majority of our research and development expenses related to our mds endoscope reprocessor and specialty filtration products 
the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal  compared with fiscal  is due to less development work on the european version of our mds endoscope reprocessor 
interest interest expense increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to the increase in average outstanding borrowings as a result of financing the purchase prices of the acquisitions of ge water  dsi  verimetrix and strong dental 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to a lower average balance of cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in average interest rates 
income from continuing operations before taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscals and  respectively 
the decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate was affected principally by the geographic mix of pre tax income and statutory tax rate reductions as described below 
the majority of our income from continuing operations before income taxes is generated from our united states operations  which had an overall effective tax rate in fiscal of 
this low overall effective rate is principally caused by i our combined federal and state statutory tax rate of approximately as applied to current operations and ii recently enacted new york state tax rate reductions as applied to existing deferred income tax liabilities in our healthcare disposables segment 
our canadian operations had an overall effective tax rate in fiscal of  which overall rate was favorably impacted by recently enacted canadian federal tax rate reductions as applied to existing deferred income tax liabilities in the canadian portion of our water purification and filtration business 
a tax benefit was not recorded on the losses from operations at our netherlands subsidiary for fiscals and  thereby causing our overall consolidated effective tax rate to exceed the effective tax rates in our united states and canadian operations 
although we continued to incur an overall loss from our netherlands operation in fiscal  such loss decreased significantly compared to fiscal in fiscal  we completed the restructuring of our netherlands operation as described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
additionally  during fiscal we decided to place a full valuation allowance against the nols of our japanese subsidiary  which resulted in the recording of tax expense on the past losses of our subsidiary in japan 
the results of continuing operations for our subsidiary in singapore did not have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate for fiscal due to the size of the operation relative to our united states  canada and netherlands operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and therefore was adopted on august  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since  after the completion of our evaluation  we did not record an increase or decrease to our income taxes payable or deferred tax liabilities related to unrecognized income tax benefits for uncertain tax positions 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the majority of our unrecognized tax benefits originated from acquisitions 
accordingly  any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions are recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill 
therefore  if the unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements in future periods  there would not be a significant impact to our effective tax rate on continuing operations 
we do not expect such unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase in the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits on august  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  generally  the company is no longer subject to federal  state or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years ended prior to july  our policy is to record potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense and general and administrative expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
however  such amounts have been relatively insignificant due to the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation the following table shows the income statement components of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses discontinued operations stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax the above stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from net income by  and in fiscals  and  respectively and an increase to additional capital 
the related income tax benefits which pertain only to stock awards and options that do not qualify as incentive stock options were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities or a reduction to income taxes payable  depending on the timing of the deduction  and a reduction to income tax expense 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  assumptions used in determining fair value and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which is expected to be  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
most of our stock option and stock awards which consist only of restricted shares are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of tax  related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
if certain criteria are met when options are exercised  or with respect to incentive stock options the underlying shares are sold  the company is allowed a deduction on its income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as additional capital assuming deferred tax assets do not exist pertaining to the exercised stock options and as a reduction of income taxes payable 
in fiscals and  options exercised resulted in income tax deductions that reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively 
we classify the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense including tax benefits on stock compensation expense that has only been reflected in past pro forma disclosures relating to fiscal years prior to august  which was determined based upon the award s fair value 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at july   our working capital was  compared with  at july  cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscals  and  respectively 
with respect to continuing operations only  net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes and a decrease in inventories due to strong july sales in our healthcare disposables and endoscope reprocessing segments as well as a decrease in the cost of certain raw materials  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to an increase in prepaid commissions relating to service contracts in our endoscope reprocessing segment  as well as the timing of certain insurance premium payments 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes  a decrease in accounts receivable due to improved collections and an increase in income taxes payable due to timing associated with payments  partially offset by increases in inventories due to planned increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our endoscope reprocessing and healthcare disposables segments and prepaid expenses due to the prepayment of certain operating expenses primarily relating to commissions 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to increased purchases in july to meet product demand and additional compensation as a result of more personnel  including the additional sales and service personnel of our endoscope reprocessing operating segment 
these items were partially offset by increases in i accounts receivable due to strong sales in the months of july and june  including sales related to the ge water acquisition  and increases in customer prices in our endoscope reprocessing operating segment as a result of the direct sales effort and ii inventories due to planned increases in stock levels of certain products and decreases in i net liabilities of discontinued operations due to the wind down of carsen s operations including substantial tax payments that were payable in fiscal and ii income taxes payable due to timing associated with payments 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisition of gem  a payment for an acquisition earnout to the former owners of crosstex and capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of our building in the netherlands 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisitions of dsi  verimetrix and strong dental  a payment for an acquisition earnout to the former owners of crosstex and capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisitions of ge water and twist  an earnout payment to the former owners of crosstex and capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to repayments under our credit facilities and purchases of treasury stock  partially offset by a borrowing under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercises of stock options 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to borrowings under our revolving credit facility primarily related to the acquisitions of dsi  verimetrix and strong dental and proceeds from the exercises of stock options  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities and purchases of treasury stock 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to borrowings under our revolving credit facility related to the acquisition of ge water  net of debt issuance costs and proceeds from the exercises of stock options  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities and purchases of treasury stock 
repurchase of shares in may  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock under a repurchase program commencing on june  under the repurchase program we repurchased shares from time to time at prevailing prices and as permitted by applicable securities laws including sec rule b and new york stock exchange requirements 
the repurchase program had a one year term that expired on june  the first repurchase under our repurchase program occurred on july  through july   we completed the repurchase of  shares under the program at a total average price per share of 
we repurchased an additional  shares through october  at a total average price per share of 
no additional repurchases were made subsequent to the end of our first quarter ended october  therefore  at the conclusion of the repurchase program on june   we had repurchased  shares under the repurchase program at a total average price per share of 
in april  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock under a repurchase program that expired on april  we repurchased  shares under that repurchase program at a total average price per share of 
of the  shares   and  shares were repurchased during fiscals and  respectively 
restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our management approved and initiated plans to restructure our netherlands subsidiary by relocating all of our manufacturing operations from the netherlands to the united states 
this action is part of our continuing effort to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies by leveraging the existing infrastructure of our minntech operations in minnesota 
the elimination of manufacturing operations in the netherlands has led to the end of onsite material management  quality assurance  finance and accounting  human resources and some customer service functions 
however  we continue to maintain a strong marketing  sales  service and technical support presence based in the netherlands to serve customers throughout europe  the middle east and africa 
in fiscals and  we recorded  and  respectively  in restructuring expenses  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately in both years 
the cumulative amount of such costs incurred as of july  was  the restructuring plan has been completed and therefore we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring costs 
the decrease in the total expected restructuring expense estimated at july  compared to actual costs incurred in fiscal was primarily due to the significant decrease in the value of the euro in relation to the united states dollar 
the majority of the restructuring costs are included in our endoscope reprocessing segment 
the restructuring costs recorded are as follows cost of sales general and administrative expenses unsalable aggregate inventory severance total severance other total total three months ended july  expense inventory disposal accrued balance at july  three months ended october  expense paid foreign currency translation accrued balance at october  three months ended january  expense paid foreign currency translation accrued balance at january  three months ended april  expense foreign currency translation accrued balance at april  three months ended july  expense paid inventory disposal foreign currency translation accrued balance at july  total restructuring expenses incurred since the above costs were recorded in our netherlands subsidiary  which had been experiencing losses from its operations  tax benefits on the above costs were not recorded 
the unsalable inventory was recorded in inventories as part of our inventory reserve and the accrued severance was recorded in compensation payable in our consolidated balance sheets 
as part of the restructuring plan  we sold our netherlands building and land on may  and entered into a lease for years with the new owner so we can continue to use the facility as our european sales and service headquarters as well as for warehouse and distribution activity 
at july   these assets had a book value of  net of accumulated depreciation  and were included in property and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet 
the sale of the building and land resulted in a gain of  which will be amortized over the life of the lease and is recorded in deferred revenue and other long term liabilities 
the rent for the full year lease of  was paid from the sale proceeds and recorded as a prepaid expense in the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations termination of carsen s operations on july   carsen closed the sale of substantially all of its assets to olympus under an asset purchase agreement dated as of may  among carsen  cantel and olympus 
olympus purchased substantially all of carsen s assets other than those related to carsen s medivators business and certain other smaller product lines 
following the closing  olympus hired substantially all of carsen s employees and took over carsen s olympus related operations as well as the operations related to the other acquired product lines 
the transaction resulted in an after tax gain of  and was recorded separately on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended july  as gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax 
in connection with the transaction  carsen s medivators related assets as well as certain of its other assets that were not acquired by olympus were sold to our new canadian distributor of medivators products 
the purchase price for the net assets sold to olympus was approximately  comprised of a fixed sum of  plus an additional formula based sum of  in addition  olympus paid carsen of olympus revenues attributable to carsen s unfilled customer orders backlog as of july  that were assumed by olympus at the closing 
such payments to carsen were made following olympus receipt of customer payments for such orders and totaled  in fiscal  the entire  related to such backlog was recorded as income and reported in income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the consolidated statements of income 
the  fixed portion of the purchase price was in consideration for i carsen s customer lists  sales records  and certain other assets related to the sale and servicing of olympus products and certain non olympus products distributed by carsen  ii the release of olympus contractual restriction on hiring carsen personnel  iii real property leases which were assumed or replaced by olympus and leasehold improvements  computer and software systems  equipment and machinery  telephone systems  and records related to the acquired assets  and iv assisting olympus in effecting a smooth transition of carsen s business of distributing and servicing olympus and certain non olympus products in canada 
cantel has also agreed on behalf of itself and its affiliates not to manufacture  distribute  sell or represent for sale in canada through july  any products that are competitive with the olympus products formerly sold by carsen under its olympus distribution agreements 
the  formula based portion of the purchase price was based on the book value of carsen s inventories of olympus and certain non olympus products and the net book amount of carsen s accounts receivable and certain other assets  all at july   subject to offsets  particularly for accounts payable of carsen due to olympus 
net proceeds from carsen s sale of net assets and the termination of carsen s operations were approximately  excluding the backlog payments after satisfaction of remaining liabilities and taxes 
as a result of the foregoing transaction  which coincided with the expiration of carsen s exclusive distribution agreements with olympus on july   carsen no longer has any remaining product lines or active business operations 
cash flows attributable to discontinued operations consist solely of net cash used in operating activities of  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was due to the payment of carsen s remaining liabilities that existed at july   which primarily related to various taxes 
in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the payment of carsen s remaining operating costs relating to fiscal  income tax payments and various wind down costs  partially offset by the collection of the remaining receivables 
long term contractual obligations as of july   aggregate annual required payments over the next five years and thereafter under our contractual obligations that have long term components are as follows year ended july  amounts in thousands thereafter total maturities of the credit facilities expected interest payments under the credit facilities minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases minimum commitments under noncancelable capital leases deferred compensation and other employment agreements total contractual obligations the expected interest payments under the term and revolving credit facilities reflect interest rates of and  respectively  which were our interest rates on outstanding borrowings at july  since we expect to modify our credit facilities before the expiration date of our revolving credit facility  as further explained below  the margin applicable to our interest rates on outstanding borrowings may increase during fiscal credit facilities in conjunction with the acquisition of crosstex  we entered into amended and restated credit facilities dated as of august  the us credit facilities with a consortium of lenders to fund the cash consideration paid in the acquisition and costs associated with the acquisition  as well as to modify our existing united states credit facilities 
the us credit facilities  as amended  include i a six year million senior secured amortizing term loan facility and ii a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
amounts we repay under the term loan facility may not be re borrowed 
debt issuance costs relating to the us credit facilities are recorded in other assets and are being amortized over the life of the credit facilities 
such unamortized debt issuance costs amounted to approximately  at july  at september   borrowings under the us credit facilities bear interest at rates ranging from to above the lender s base rate  or at rates ranging from to above the london interbank offered rate libor  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and as further adjusted under the terms of the us credit facilities ebitda 
at september   the lender s base rate was and the libor rates applicable to our outstanding borrowings ranged from to 
the margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings at september  were above the lender s base rate and above libor 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at september  the majority of such contracts were twelve month libor contracts  therefore  we are substantially protected throughout most of fiscal from any exposure associated with increasing libor rates 
the us credit facilities also provide for fees on the unused portion of our facilities at rates ranging from to  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to ebitda  such rate was at september  in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement on july  for the two year period beginning june  and ending june  initially covering  of borrowings under the term loan facility and thereafter reducing in quarterly  increments consistent with the mandatory repayment schedule of our term loan facility  which caps three month libor on this portion of outstanding borrowings at 
this interest rate cap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge instrument 
the cost of the interest rate cap  which was previously included in other assets  was  during fiscal  the difference between the interest rate cap agreement s amortized cost and its fair value was recorded as an unrealized loss and included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in july  the interest rate cap agreement was determined to be ineffective since the interest rates on substantially all of our outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility were protected under libor contracts substantially below 
accordingly  we reclassified the  change in fair value of the interest rate cap agreement from an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income into a recognized loss in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
no further gains or losses relating to this interest rate cap agreement will occur in the future 
the us credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants and are secured by i substantially all of our us based assets including assets of cantel  minntech  mar cor  crosstex and strong dental and ii our pledge of all of the outstanding shares of minntech  mar cor  crosstex and strong dental and of the outstanding shares of our foreign based subsidiaries 
additionally  we are not permitted to pay cash dividends on our common stock without the consent of our united states lenders 
as of july   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the us credit facilities 
on july   we had  of outstanding borrowings under the us credit facilities  which consisted of  and  under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility  respectively 
in september  we repaid  under the revolving credit facility and  under our term loan facility reducing our total outstanding borrowings to  the revolving portion of our credit facilities has a termination date of august  although we may repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the revolver throughout fiscal  we do not presently anticipate paying off the revolver in full by its termination date 
we are in discussions with our bank syndicate regarding modifications to such facility  including an extension of the termination date  and expect to formally modify the facility before the expiration date 
however  since any modification will not be completed until later in fiscal  subsequent to july  we will be required to reclassify the entire outstanding balance of the revolver from long term to current 
operating leases minimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities  warehouses  office space and equipment 
rent expense related to operating leases for fiscal was recorded on a straight line basis and aggregated  compared with  and  for fiscals and  respectively 
license agreement on january   we entered into a license agreement with a third party which allows us to manufacture  use  import  sell and distribute certain thermal control products relating to our specialty packaging segment 
in consideration  we agreed to pay a minimum annual royalty payable in canadian dollars each calendar year over the license agreement term of years 
in fiscal  the license agreement was modified to reduce the royalty rate and remove the minimum royalty obligation 
deferred compensation included in other long term liabilities are deferred compensation arrangements for certain former minntech directors and officers 
employment agreements we have previously entered into various employment agreements with executives of the company  including our corporate executive staff and our subsidiary presidents 
the majority of such contracts have expired or will expire in early fiscal the compensation committee of the board of directors is actively working on new agreements and has retained a third party consulting firm to provide advice on executive compensation and to assist with this process 
in the interim  the compensation committee has agreed that in the event the employment of any of these executives is terminated by the company without cause  the executive will continue to receive his base salary through july  effective april   our former president and chief executive officer resigned and our chief operating officer and executive vice president was promoted to president 
as a result of this resignation  estimated separations benefits and other related costs of approximately  were recorded in general and administrative expenses during fiscal  all of which was paid in fiscal convertible note receivable in february  we invested an initial  in a senior subordinated convertible promissory note the note issued by biosafe  inc biosafe  in connection with biosafe s grant to us of certain exclusive and non exclusive license rights to biosafe s antimicrobial additive 
biosafe is the owner of a patented and proprietary antimicrobial agent that is built into the manufacturing of end products to achieve long lasting microbial protection on such end products surface 
as a result of biosafe s successful raising of a minimum incremental amount of cash following our investment  we are obligated to invest an additional  in notes of biosafe  which is expected to occur in the first half of fiscal the note accrues interest at a per annum rate of until the maturity date of june  or earlier exercise 
the note is convertible into a newly created series of preferred stock of biosafe 
interest is payable in shares of biosafe stock  or if a next round of financing does not occur by the maturity date  in cash 
if not paid by the maturity date  interest will accrue thereafter at a rate of per annum 
in connection with our investment  we entered into a license agreement with biosafe under which we will pay biosafe a fixed royalty percentage of sales of our products containing biosafe s antimicrobial formulation 
this investment  together with the accrued interest of  is included within other assets in our consolidated balance sheet at july  financing needs at july   we had a cash balance of  of which  was held by foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that our current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations  and the funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations  particularly given that we historically have not needed to borrow for working capital purposes 
at september    was available under our united states revolving credit facility  which expires on august  notwithstanding our cash position and revolving credit borrowing availability  under the terms of our credit facilities we are limited to the amount of aggregate purchase price we pay for acquisitions during the duration of the credit agreement without obtaining prior bank approval 
as of july   the remaining purchase price available for future acquisitions without obtaining prior bank approval is approximately  foreign currency in fiscal  compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar decreased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
additionally  at july  compared with july   the value of the canadian dollar relative to the value of the united states dollar decreased by approximately 
the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
additionally  changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affected our results of operations because a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
in fiscal  compared with fiscal  the average value of the euro decreased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
additionally  at july  compared with july   the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar decreased by approximately 
the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the euro exchange rate relative to the united states dollar 
additionally  changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar and british pound affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of our netherlands subsidiary which are reported in our dialysis  endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration segments are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars or british pounds but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
furthermore  as part of the restructuring of our netherlands subsidiary  as described in note to the consolidated financials and elsewhere in this md a  a portion of the net assets of our united states subsidiaries  minntech and mar cor  are now denominated and ultimately settled in euros or british pounds but must be converted into our functional united states currency 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of i the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  ii the euro relative to the united states dollar and british pound and iii the british pound relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such net assets into the functional currencies  we enter into short term contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros and british pounds forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
there were three foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of  at september   which cover certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
such contracts expired on september  these foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one month contracts as long as we have significant net assets at our subsidiaries that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than their functional currencies 
under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros and british pounds may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  such foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
gains and losses related to these hedging contracts to buy canadian dollars  euros and british pounds forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
in fiscal  such forward contracts partially offset the impact on operations related to certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar in fiscal  compared with fiscal  did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of our balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had a favorable impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our net income of approximately  primarily due to the decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar 
for purposes of translating the balance sheet at july  compared with july   the total of the foreign currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of  in fiscal  thereby decreasing stockholders equity 
inflation during fiscal  we experienced unprecedented price increases in certain raw materials due in large part to the rising price of fuel and oil  including chemicals  paper pulp and plastics resins and bottles  which had a significant adverse impact on our gross margins 
rising fuel and oil prices also had a significant adverse impact on distribution costs related to both the purchasing and delivery of products  which also impacted our gross margins 
we implemented price increases for certain of our products  which partially offset these cost increases  however  some of our businesses primarily the water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables segments were unable to obtain higher selling prices necessary to offset the full impact of such higher costs  which resulted in the loss of gross margin 
in fiscal  the cost of certain raw materials and distribution costs decreased compared with fiscal resulting in improved gross margins  as more fully described in results of operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we continually evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to dialysis  therapeutic  specialty packaging and endoscope reprocessing products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and fob destination when our distribution fleet is utilized except for one large customer in dialysis whereby all products are shipped fob destination 
with respect to water purification and filtration and healthcare disposable products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  primarily with respect to some of our water purification and filtration equipment  endoscope reprocessing equipment and an insignificant amount of our sales of dialysis equipment  post delivery obligations such as installation  in servicing or training are contractually specified  in such instances  revenue recognition is deferred until all of such conditions have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
with respect to a portion of water purification and filtration product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered 
a portion of our water purification and filtration and endoscope reprocessing sales are recognized as multiple element arrangements  whereby revenue is allocated to the equipment  installation and service components based upon vendor specific objective evidence  which principally includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment and installation sold as stand alone components  as well as an evaluation of unrelated third party competitor pricing of similar installation 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer s location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers 
with respect to certain service contracts in our endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration operating segments  service revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within cost of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
none of our sales contain right of return provisions 
customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be pre approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of our sales of dialysis  healthcare disposable and water purification and filtration products and certain prepaid packaging products 
we do not offer price protection  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products 
with respect to certain of our dialysis  dental  water purification and filtration and endoscope reprocessing customers  volume rebates are provided  such volume rebates are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
the increase in volume rebates in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to new terms in a recently renewed rebate arrangement with a major dental distributor in our healthcare disposables segment 
such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume for the entire rebate periods 
if it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections  the volume rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly 
the majority of our dialysis products are sold to end users  the majority of therapeutic filtration products and healthcare disposable products are sold to third party distributors  water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly and through third party distributors to hospitals  dialysis clinics  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other end users  our endoscope reprocessing products and services are sold primarily to distributors internationally and directly to hospitals and other end users in the united states  and specialty packaging products are sold to third party distributors  medical research companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals  government agencies and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
while actual losses have historically been within management s expectations and provisions established  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
alternatively  if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables  reductions in allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of raw materials and finished products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  we use historical experience as well as current market information 
with few exceptions  the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management s expectation and provisions established  however  rapid changes in the market due to competition  technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories  resulting in the need for additional reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets certain of our identifiable intangible assets  including customer relationships  technology  brand names  non compete agreements and patents  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
additionally  we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
all of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
our management is primarily responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors  including third party valuations  when making these determinations 
in performing a review for goodwill impairment  management uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments by using the average fair value results of the market multiple and discounted cash flow methodologies 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
in performing our annual review for indefinite lived intangibles  management compares the current fair value of such assets to their carrying values 
with respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present  management would determine whether expected future non discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  if not  the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value 
on july   management concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired 
while the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment  impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of our future operating results and cash flows which management believes to be reasonable  discount rates based on the company s weighted average cost of capital and appropriate benchmark peer companies 
assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales forecasts 
subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in future impairment 
although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
at july   our reporting units that were potentially at risk for impairment were healthcare disposables and specialty packaging  which had average fair values that exceeded book value by approximately and  respectively 
with respect to healthcare disposables  such average fair value was determined using future operating and cash flow assumptions that management believes to be conservative  especially in light of more recent market conditions such as the outbreak of the novel hn flu swine flu  which could have a positive impact on future results of this segment 
for all of our remaining reporting units  average fair value exceeded book value by substantial amounts 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected non discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
with few exceptions  our historical assessments of our long lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized 
however  the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective  and accordingly  actual amounts realized may differ significantly from our estimates 
warranties we provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition 
most of our products have a one year warranty  although a majority of our endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states carries a warranty period of up to fifteen months 
we record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold 
the historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate 
a significant increase in third party service repair rates  the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
stock based compensation on august   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment revised sfas r using the modified prospective method for the transition 
under the modified prospective method  stock compensation expense is recognized for any option grant or stock award granted on or after august   as well as the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to august   based upon the award s fair value 
for fiscal and earlier periods  we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under which stock compensation expense is not recognized because we granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
most of our stock option and stock awards which consist only of restricted stock are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  modifications to existing awards and assumptions used in determining fair value  expected lives and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which is expected to be  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to pending and threatened legal actions 
it is our policy to accrue for amounts related to these legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount of anticipated exposure can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that any of these pending claims or legal actions will have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets  as adjusted for valuation allowances  will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
a review of our deferred tax items considers known future changes in various effective tax rates  principally in the united states 
if the effective tax rate were to change in the future  particularly in the united states and to a lesser extent canada  our items of deferred tax could be materially affected 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
in fiscal  an increase in our federal tax rate to as well as recently enacted canadian federal and new york state statutory tax rate reductions were applied to existing overall deferred income tax liabilities  which resulted in virtually no change in our overall effective tax rates 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the majority of such unrecognized tax benefits originated from acquisitions and are based primarily upon management s assessment of exposure associated with acquired companies 
accordingly  any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions have been recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill 
subsequent to our august  adoption of sfas r  the resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions will be recognized in our results of operations 
unrecognized tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made  as events occur to warrant adjustment to the related liability 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
certain liabilities and reserves are subjective in nature 
we reflect such liabilities and reserves based upon the most recent information available 
in conjunction with our acquisitions  such subjective liabilities and reserves principally include certain income tax and sales and use tax exposures  including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries  as well as reserves for accounts receivable  inventories and warranties 
the ultimate settlement of such liabilities may be for amounts which are different from the amounts recorded 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities we recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as costs to terminate a contract  the exit or disposal of a business  or the early termination of a leased property  by recognizing the liability at fair value when incurred  except for certain one time termination benefits  such as severance costs  for which the period of recognition begins when a severance plan is communicated to employees 
inherent in the calculation of liabilities relating to exit and disposal activities are significant management judgments and estimates  including estimates of termination costs  employee attrition and the interest rate used to discount certain expected net cash payments 
such judgments and estimates are reviewed by us on a regular basis 
the cumulative effect of a change to a liability resulting from a revision to either timing or the amount of estimated cash flows is recognized by us as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
although we have historically recorded minimal charges associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded approximately  and  in charges associated with exit or disposal activities in fiscals and  respectively  relating to our restructuring plan for our netherlands manufacturing operations 
other matters we do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements  other than future commitments under operating leases and employment and license agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and market risk a portion of our products in all of our business segments are exported to and imported from a variety of geographic locations  and our business could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting all of such geographies included but not limited to the united states  canada  the european union  the united kingdom and the far east 
a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
the businesses of our canadian subsidiaries could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar also affect our results of operations because the net assets of our canadian subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into their functional currency 
additionally  the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states and canada had an overall favorable impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our net income  despite an unfavorable impact on sales  and an adverse impact upon stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar and british pound affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of our netherlands subsidiary which are reported in our dialysis  endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration segments are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars or british pounds but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
furthermore  as part of the restructuring of our netherlands subsidiary  as described in note to the consolidated financials and elsewhere in this md a  a portion of the net assets of our united states subsidiaries  minntech and mar cor  are now denominated and ultimately settled in euros or british pounds but must be converted into our functional united states currency 
additionally  the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the euro  the united states dollar and british pound had an overall favorable impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our net income  and had an adverse impact upon stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of i the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  ii the euro relative to the united states dollar and british pound and iii the british pound relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such net assets into functional currencies  we enter into short term contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros and british pounds forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
there were three foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of  at july   which covered certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
such contracts expired on august  these foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one month contracts as long as we have significant net assets at our subsidiaries that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than their functional currencies 
under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros and british pounds may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
in fiscal  such forward contracts were partially effective in offsetting a portion of the impact on operations related to certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
the functional currency of minntech s japan subsidiary is the japanese yen 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar in fiscal  compared with fiscal  did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had a favorable impact on our net income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to the decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  and an adverse impact upon stockholders equity 
interest rate market risk we have a united states credit facility for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings are under libor contracts 
therefore  interest expense is affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states as well as libor interest rates 
market risk sensitive transactions we are exposed to market risks arising principally from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
with respect to interest rate risk  our outstanding debt is under our united states credit facilities  described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
such credit facilities consist of outstanding debt with fixed repayment amounts at prevailing market rates of interest  principally under libor contracts ranging from one to twelve months 
therefore  our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with libor 
such outstanding debt under our united states credit facilities was  and  at july  and  respectively  and the average outstanding balance during fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively 
during fiscals and  the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was and  respectively 
a basis point increase in average libor interest rates would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  and  during fiscals and  respectively 
however  the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt at july  has decreased to due to decreases in libor rates as well as the margin applicable to our outstanding borrowings 
all of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at july  the majority of such contracts were twelve month libor contracts entered into in recent months  therefore  we are substantially protected throughout most of fiscal from any exposure associated with increasing libor rates 
we are in discussions with our bank syndicate regarding modifications to our revolving credit facility  including an extension of the termination date  and expect to formally modify the facility before its expiration 
due to current market conditions  a modification of our credit facilities will likely result in an increase of our margins above the lender s base rate and libor  which may adversely affect our fiscal results of operations 
in addition  depending upon the structure of the modification  we may be required to write off certain deferred financing costs that are recorded in other assets and are currently being amortized over the life of the credit facilities 
our other long term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates 
we also maintained a cash balance of  at july  which is either maintained in cash or invested in low risk and low return cash equivalents such as short term guaranteed investment certificates issued by various canadian banks  canadian treasury bills and united states money market funds with leading banking institutions 
an increase in interest rates would generate additional interest income for us from these low risk cash equivalents  which would partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rates  we are principally impacted by changes in the canadian dollar  euro and british pound as these currencies relate to the united states dollar 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
our canadian subsidiaries and netherlands subsidiary have net assets in currencies principally united states dollars other than their functional canadian and euro currency  which must be converted into its functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
similarly  our united states subsidiaries have net assets in currencies principally euros and british pounds other than their functional united states currency  which must be converted into its functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
therefore  our canadian subsidiaries  netherlands subsidiary and united states subsidiaries are exposed to risk if the value of the canadian dollar  euro and british pound appreciates relative to the united states dollar 
for fiscals and  a uniform increase in the canadian dollar  euro and british pound relative to the united states dollar would have resulted in aggregate realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively 
however  since certain of our subsidiaries use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the impact of fluctuations of the canadian dollar  euro and british pound relative to the united states dollar  realized losses relating to the fluctuation of those currencies would be partially offset by gains on the foreign currency forward contracts 
in addition to the above  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our financial statements 
for fiscals and  a uniform adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively  due to the translation of the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries adverse changes would be caused by appreciation of either the canadian dollar or the euro relative to the united states dollar 
however  such a change in foreign currency rates would have resulted in an unrealized gain on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries of  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
such an unrealized gain would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our stockholders equity 
conversely  if the canadian dollar and the euro depreciated by relative to the united states dollar  we would have recognized realized gains after tax of approximately  and  in fiscals and  respectively  and unrealized losses of  and  in fiscals and  respectively  on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
however  since we view these investments as long term  we would not expect such unrealized losses to be realized in the near term 
the aggregate adverse impact  net of tax  to our results of operations of a uniform increase in foreign currency exchange rates  as described above  due to both financial statement translation and functional currency conversion would have been  and  for fiscals and  respectively  partially offset by the affect of our foreign currency forward contracts
