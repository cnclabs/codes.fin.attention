the notes are direct financial obligations of golden gate and are not guaranteed by the company or protective life 
the notes were issued in order to provide financing for a portion of the statutory reserves associated with a block of life insurance policies 
as the block of business ages  unless additional funding mechanisms are put into place  reserving increases will reduce the company s available statutory capital and surplus 
the company has experienced higher borrowing costs associated with the series a surplus notes

commercial mortgage securitizations retained interests are recorded at fair value and included in securities available for sale 
subsequent adjustments to fair value are recorded through other comprehensive income 
during  the company changed certain assumptions used in its methodology for determining the fair value for retained beneficial interests in commercial mortgage backed security cmbs holdings related to the company s sponsored commercial mortgage loan securitizations 
prior to the third quarter  the company used external broker valuations to determine the fair value of these positions 
these valuations were based on the cash flows of the commercial mortgages underlying the notes  as well as observable market spread assumptions for investments with similar coupons and or characteristics based on the fair value hierarchy criteria  and non observable assumptions and factors utilizing general market information available as of the valuation date 
as of december   the company still believes that little or no secondary market existed for cmbs holdings similar to those in the company s portfolio  and additionally  certain of the tranches within the company s holdings fell below the collapse provision levels in the underlying security agreements 
therefore  the relevant observable inputs from cmbs sales activity could not be obtained for what the company considered a supportable or appropriate calculation of fair value based on the company s previous methodology 
as a result of the factors noted and in accordance with the clarifying guidance issued in sfas no 
 during  the company determined the fair value of these cmbs holdings using a combination of external broker valuations and an internally developed model 
this model includes inputs derived by the company based on assumed discount rates relative to the company s current mortgage loan lending rate and an expected cash flow analysis based on a review of the commercial mortgage loans underlying the notes 
the model also contains the company s determined representative risk adjustment assumptions related to nonperformance and liquidity risks 
the retained interest in the securitized mortgage loans may be subject to prepayment and interest rate risks 
the company believes that this valuation approach provides a more accurate calculation of the fair value of these securities under the fair value hierarchy guidance and given the current inactive market conditions 
management will periodically review the historical performance of the mortgage loans and the assumptions used to project future cash flows 
assumptions will be revised if this analysis of past performance and future expectations dictates 
the present value of cash flows will then be recalculated based on the revised assumptions 
the company updates these values on a quarterly basis 
commercial mortgage securitization on december   subsidiaries of the company entered into agreements providing for the securitization of billion of commercial and multifamily real estate mortgage loans 
the loans were previously originated by protective life  and were sold to a subsidiary of protective life  protective finance corporation pfc  on december  pfc transferred the mortgage loans to a trust fund in exchange for twenty six classes of pass through certificates representing  in the aggregate  the entire beneficial interest of the trust fund 
the certificates are direct financial obligations of the trust fund and are not guaranteed by the company  protective life  pfc or its affiliates 
pursuant to a certificate purchase agreement dated december  among pfc  protective life and a third party initial purchaser  pfc sold one class of certificates with a certificate balance of million to the initial purchaser  and the initial purchaser resold such certificates in one or more private offerings 
the remaining classes of certificates  reflecting a par value of million  were transferred from pfc to protective life in exchange for the mortgage loans 
during  the company recorded a million loss on the tranche that was sold to an external party 
as of december   the company s retained securities had a fair value of million 
following the mortgage securitization transaction  the company retained responsibility for servicing the mortgage loans  and  as such  is entitled to receive an ongoing fee 
there were no servicing assets or liabilities recorded as the benefits of servicing the assets were adequate to compensate for the servicing responsibilities 
the company retained an interest in the securitized mortgage loans 
these retained interests were initially recognized using their respective allocated cost basis based on their relative fair value on the date of transfer 
any gain or loss depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interest based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of securitization are as follows discount rate to weighted average life to years as of december   the company held retained beneficial interests of the commercial mortgage loan securitization completed during with a fair value of million 
the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of and in the discount rate is as follows increase in discount rate dollars in thousands fair value change the sensitivities in the preceding table are hypothetical and as the amounts indicate  changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value of an interest that continues to be held by the company is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at december   are as follows discount rate to weighted average life to yrs as of december   the total principal amount outstanding of mortgage loans under securitization and held by the trust was approximately million 
there were no delinquencies as of december  in addition  there were no credit losses for the year ended december  servicing fees received during the year ended december  were million

commitments and contingencies the company is contingently liable to obtain a million letter of credit under indemnity agreements with directors 
such agreements provide insurance protection in excess of the directors and officers liability insurance in force at the time up to million 
should certain events occur constituting a change in control  the company must obtain the letter of credit upon which directors may draw for defense or settlement of any claim relating to performance of their duties as directors 
the company has similar agreements with certain of its officers providing up to million in indemnification that are not secured by the obligation to obtain a letter of credit 
these obligations are in addition to the customary obligation to indemnify officers and directors contained in the company s bylaws 
the company leases administrative and marketing office space in approximately cities including  square feet in birmingham excluding the home office building  with most leases being for periods of three to ten years

the following is a schedule by year of future minimum rental payments required under these leases year amount dollars in thousands thereafter additionally  the company leases a building contiguous to its home office 
the lease extends to january at the end of the lease term the company may purchase the building for approximately million 
the following is a schedule by year of future minimum rental payments required under this lease year amount dollars in thousands thereafter under insurance guaranty fund laws  in most states insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies 
the company does not believe such assessments will be materially different from amounts already provided for in the financial statements 
most of these laws do provide  however  that an assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer s own financial strength 
a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers  broker dealers and other providers of financial services involving sales  refund or claims practices  alleged agent misconduct  failure to properly supervise representatives  relationships with agents or persons with whom the insurer does business  and other matters 
often these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments that are disproportionate to the actual damages  including material amounts of punitive and non economic compensatory damages 
in some states  juries  judges  and arbitrators have substantial discretion in awarding punitive non economic compensatory damages which creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments or awards in any given lawsuit or arbitration 
arbitration awards are subject to very limited appellate review 
in addition  in some class action and other lawsuits  companies have made material settlement payments 
the company  like other financial service companies  in the ordinary course of business  is involved in such litigation and arbitration 
although the company cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or arbitration  the company does not believe that any such outcome will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of the operations 
as of december  and  the company had outstanding mortgage loan commitments of million at an average rate of  and million  at an average rate of

earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period  including shares issuable under various deferred compensation plans 
diluted earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period  assuming the shares were not anti dilutive  including shares issuable under various stock based compensation plans and stock purchase contracts

such income was subject to taxation only when it was either distributed or accumulated in excess of certain prescribed limits 
the million balance in the company s policyholders surplus account as of december  has been carried forward without change since that date 
legislation was enacted in which permitted a life insurance company to reduce  during and  its policyholders surplus account balances without such reductions being subject to taxation 
during  the company followed this legislation and reduced its policyholders surplus account balance to zero 
in management s judgment  the net deferred income tax asset at december  will more likely than not be fully realized 
as of december  the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  which will expire if not used by in addition  the company had federal capital loss carryforwards of million  which will expire if not used by the company has recognized a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  related to state net operating loss carryforwards that it has determined are more likely than not to expire unutilized 
the resulting change of million in this valuation allowance is part of deferred state income tax expense 
as of december  and  no valuation allowance was established with regard to deferred tax assets relating to the impairments on fixed maturities  the tax loss carryforwards  and the unrealized losses on investments 
the company relied upon its projections of future taxable income  certain prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and its ability and intent to hold to recovery its bonds that are currently reported at an unrealized loss 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  fin no 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows as of december  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of period additions for tax positions of the current year additions for tax positions of prior years reductions of tax positions of prior years for changes in judgment settlements during the period lapses of applicable statute of limitations balance  end of period included in the balance above  as of december  and  are approximately million and million of unrecognized tax benefits  respectively  for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductions 
other than interest and penalties  the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate to an earlier period the payment of cash to the taxing authority 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  that would affect the effective tax rate is approximately million as of december  and  respectively 
any accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits have been included in income tax expense 
the company has approximately million of accrued interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and before taking into consideration the related income tax benefit that is associated with such an expense  respectively 
using the information available as of december   the company believes that in the next months  there are no positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease 
in general  the company is no longer subject to us federal  state and local income tax examinations by taxing authorities for tax years that began before supplemental cash flow information the following table sets forth supplemental cash flow information for the years ended december dollars in thousands cash paid received during the year interest on debt income taxes noncash investing and financing activities reissuance of treasury stock to esop change in unallocated stock in esop stock based compensation increase decrease in collateral for securities lending transactions total cash interest paid on debt during was million 
of this amount  million related to interest on long term debt  million related to interest on non recourse funding obligations  million related to interest on subordinated debt  and million related to other interest 
related party transactions certain corporations with which the company s directors were affiliated paid us premiums and policy fees or other amounts for various types of insurance and investment products 
such premiums  policy fees  and other amounts totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the company paid commissions  interest on debt and investment products  and fees to these same corporations totaling million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   certain noninsurance subsidiaries loaned securities with a fair value amount of million  including accrued interest  to the holding company plc 
plc then transferred these securities to protective life insurance company through a capital contribution 
these transactions were eliminated in consolidation 
in addition  golden gate issued million in aggregate principal amount of floating rate surplus notes to plc 
the company has also entered into intercompany reinsurance agreements that provide for a more balanced mix of business at various insurance entities 
these transactions were eliminated in consolidation 
statutory reporting practices and other regulatory matters financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap differ in some respects from the statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities 
the most significant differences are as follows a acquisition costs of obtaining new business are deferred and amortized over the approximate life of the policies rather than charged to operations as incurred  b benefit liabilities are computed using a net level method and are based on realistic estimates of expected mortality  interest  and withdrawals as adjusted to provide for possible unfavorable deviation from such assumptions  c deferred income taxes are not subject to statutory limitations as to amounts recognized and are recognized through earnings as opposed to being charged to shareowners equity  d the asset valuation reserve and interest maintenance reserve are restored to shareowners equity  e furniture and equipment  agents debit balances  and prepaid expenses are reported as assets rather than being charged directly to surplus referred to as nonadmitted assets  f certain items of interest income  such as mortgage and bond discounts  are amortized differently  and g bonds are recorded at their market values instead of amortized cost 
statutory net loss for protective life was million for the year ended december  and statutory net income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
statutory capital and surplus for protective life was  million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
state insurance regulators and the naic have adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks 
the requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile 
a company s risk based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset  premium  claim  expense and reserve items 
regulators can then measure the adequacy of a company s statutory surplus by comparing it to the rbc 
under rbc requirements  regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company s total adjusted capital  as defined by the insurance regulators  to its company action level of rbc known as the rbc ratio  also as defined by insurance regulators 
as of december  the company s total adjusted capital and company action level rbc was  million and million  respectively  providing an rbc ratio of approximately 
as of december   the company s insurance subsidiaries had on deposit with regulatory authorities  fixed maturity and short term investments with a market value of approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments effective january   the company determined the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in sfas no 
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
in compliance with sfas no 
 the company has categorized its financial instruments  based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique  into a three level hierarchy 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
if the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy  the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument 
financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active or significant inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include the following a quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets b quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets c inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable d inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means 
level prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
they reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 the company recognized the following adjustment to opening retained earnings for its equity indexed annuities that were previously accounted for under sfas no 
carrying value prior to adoption january  carrying value after adoption january  transition adjustment to retained earnings gain loss dollars in thousands equity indexed annuity reserves  net pre tax cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no

in addition  the company recognized a transition adjustment for the embedded derivative liability related to annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits 
the impact of this adjustment  net of dac amortization  reduced income before income taxes by million during the first quarter of

determination of fair values the valuation methodologies used to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities under the guidance within sfas no 
reflect market participant assumptions and are based on the application of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable market inputs over unobservable inputs 
the company determines the fair values of certain financial assets and financial liabilities based on quoted market prices  where available 
the company also determines certain fair values based on future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate 
fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality  the company s credit standing  liquidity and  where appropriate  risk margins on unobservable parameters 
the following is a discussion of the methodologies used to determine fair values for the financial instruments within the scope of sfas no 
 as listed in the above table 
fixed maturity  short term  and equity securities the fair value of fixed maturity  short term  and equity securities is determined by management after considering one of three primary sources of information third party pricing services  independent broker quotations  or pricing matrices 
security pricing is applied using a waterfall approach whereby publicly available prices are first sought from third party pricing services  the remaining unpriced securities are submitted to independent brokers for prices  or lastly  securities are priced using a pricing matrix 
typical inputs used by these three pricing methods include  but are not limited to  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers and reference data including market research publications 
based on the typical trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices for fixed maturities  third party pricing services normally derive the security prices through recent reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information outlined above 
if there are no recent reported trades  the third party pricing services and brokers may use matrix or model processes to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are developed based upon collateral performance and discounted at an estimated market rate 
certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations  which are considered to have no significant unobservable inputs 
a pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the company is unable to obtain or effectively rely on either a price from a third party pricing service or an independent broker quotation 
the pricing matrix used by the company begins with current spread levels to determine the market price for the security 
the credit spreads  assigned by brokers  incorporate the issuer s credit rating  liquidity discounts  weighted average of contracted cash flows  and risk premium  if warranted  due to the issuer s industry and the security s time to maturity 
the company uses credit ratings provided by nationally recognized rating agencies 
the company ensures whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through a formal process and utilization of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads and  when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has analyzed the third party pricing services valuation methodologies and related inputs  and has also evaluated the various types of securities in its investment portfolio to determine an appropriate sfas no 
fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs 
based on this evaluation and investment class analysis  each price was classified into level  or most prices provided by third party pricing services are classified into level because the significant inputs used in pricing the securities are market observable 
since securities that are priced via independent broker quotations have no significant unobservable inputs  they are generally classified as level as the observable inputs are corroborated by the company 
since the matrix pricing of certain securities debt includes significant non observable inputs  they are classified as level derivatives derivative instruments are fair valued using exchange prices  independent broker quotations or pricing valuation models  which utilize market data inputs 
excluding embedded derivatives  as of december   of derivatives based upon notional values were priced using exchange prices or independent broker quotations 
the remaining derivatives were priced by pricing valuation models  which predominantly utilize observable market data inputs 
inputs used to value derivatives include  but are not limited to  interest swap rates  credit spreads  interest and equity volatility  equity index levels and treasury rates 
the company performs monthly analysis on derivative valuations that includes both quantitative and qualitative analysis 
derivative instruments classified as level include futures and certain options  which are traded on active exchange markets 
derivative instruments classified as level primarily include interest rate  inflation  currency exchange and credit default swaps 
these derivative valuations are determined using independent broker quotations  which are corroborated with observable market inputs 
derivative instruments classified as level were total return swaps and embedded derivatives and include at least one non observable significant input 
a derivative instrument containing level and level inputs will be classified as a level financial instrument in its entirety if it has at least one significant level input 
the company utilizes derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and liabilities 
however  the derivative instruments may not be classified within the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated assets and liabilities 
therefore  the changes in fair value on derivatives reported in level may not reflect the offsetting impact of the changes in fair value of the associated assets and liabilities 
gmwb embedded derivative the gmwb embedded derivative is marked to market using current implied volatilities for the equity indices 
the methods used to estimate the liabilities employ significant unobservable inputs  such as lapses  policyholder behavior  equity market returns  interest rates  and market volatility 
the company assumes mortality of of the national association of insurance commissioners variable annuity gmdb mortality table 
as a result  the gmwb embedded derivative is categorized as level separate accounts separate account assets are invested in open ended mutual funds and are included in level the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for fair value measurements for the year ended december   for which the company has used significant unobservable inputs level total gains losses included in earnings related to instruments still held at the reporting date total realized and unrealized gains losses beginning balance included in earnings included in other comprehensive income purchases  issuances  and settlements net transfers in and or out of level ending balance dollars in thousands assets fixed maturity securities available for sale mortgage backed and asset backed securities state  municipalities and political subdivisions public utilities all other corporate bonds redeemable preferred stocks convertible bonds with warrants total fixed maturity securities available for sale fixed maturity securities trading total fixed maturity securities equity securities other long term investments short term investments total investments total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis liabilities annuity account balances other liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis represents certain freestanding and embedded derivatives represents liabilities related to equity indexed annuities total realized and unrealized gains losses on level assets and liabilities are primarily reported in either realized investment gains losses within the consolidated statements of income loss or other comprehensive income loss within shareowners equity based on the appropriate accounting treatment for the item 
purchases  sales  issuances and settlements  net  represent the activity that occurred during the period that results in a change of the asset or liability but does not represent changes in fair value for the instruments held at the beginning of the period 
such activity primarily relates to purchases and sales of fixed maturity securities  and issuances and settlements of equity indexed annuities accounted for under sfas no 
the company reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period 
changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets or liabilities 
such reclassifications are reported as transfers in and out of level at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur 
the asset transfers in the table s above primarily related to positions moved from level to level as the company determined that certain inputs were observable 
the amount of total gains losses for assets and liabilities still held as of the reporting date primarily represents changes in fair value of trading securities and certain derivatives that exist as of the reporting date  and the change in fair value of equity indexed annuities accounted for under sfas no 
during  the company changed certain assumptions used in its methodology for determining the fair value for retained beneficial interests in cmbs holdings related to the company s sponsored commercial mortgage loan securitizations 
prior to the third quarter  the company used external broker valuations to determine the fair value of these positions 
these valuations were based on the cash flows of the commercial mortgages underlying the notes  as well as observable market spread assumptions for investments with similar coupons and or characteristics based on the fair value hierarchy criteria  and non observable assumptions and factors utilizing general market information available as of the valuation date 
during  the company still believes that little or no secondary market existed for cmbs holdings similar to those in the company s portfolio  and additionally  certain of the tranches within the company s holdings fell below the collapse provision levels in the underlying security agreements 
therefore  the relevant observable inputs from cmbs sales activity could not be obtained for what the company considered a supportable or appropriate calculation of fair value based on the company s previous methodology 
as a result of the factors noted and in accordance with the clarifying guidance issued in sfas no 
 during  the company determined the fair value of these cmbs holdings using a combination of external broker valuations and an internally developed model 
this model includes inputs derived by the company based on assumed discount rates relative to the company s current mortgage loan lending rate and an expected cash flow analysis based on a review of the commercial mortgage loans underlying the notes 
the model also contains the company s determined representative risk adjustment assumptions related to nonperformance and liquidity risks 
the company believes that this valuation approach provides a more accurate calculation of the fair value of these securities under the fair value hierarchy guidance and given the current inactive market conditions 
as a result of the auction rate securities market collapse  during  the company began pricing its auction rate securities using an internally developed model 
prior to this  the company used external broker valuation to determine the fair value of these positions 
this model includes inputs derived from actively traded asset backed securities with comparable underlying collateral 
the model also contains the company s determined representative risk adjustment assumptions related to liquidity risks 
the company believes that this valuation approach provides a reasonable calculation of the fair value of these securities under the fair value hierarchy guidance and given the current inactive market conditions 
estimated fair value of financial instruments the company determines the carrying amounts and estimated fair value of our financial instruments in compliance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments at december  are as follows total realized and unrealized carrying amounts fair values carrying amounts fair values dollars in thousands assets see notes and mortgage loans on real estate policy loans liabilities see notes and stable value product account balances annuity account balances debt see note bank borrowings senior and medium term notes subordinated debt securities non recourse funding obligations except as noted below  fair values were estimated using quoted market prices 
fair value measurements mortgage loans on real estate the company estimates the fair value of mortgage loans using an internally developed model 
this model includes inputs derived by the company based on assumed discount rates relative to the company s current mortgage loan lending rate and an expected cash flow analysis based on a review of the mortgage loan terms 
the model also contains the company s determined representative risk adjustment assumptions related to nonperformance and liquidity risks 
policy loans the company believes the fair value of policy loans approximates book value 
policy loans are funds provided to policy holders in return for a claim on the account value of the policy 
the funds provided are limited to a certain percent of the account balance 
the nature of policy loans is to have low default risk as the loans are fully collateralized by the value of the policy 
the majority of policy loans do not have a stated maturity and the balances and accrued interest are repaid with proceeds from the policy account balance 
due to the collateralized nature of policy loans and unpredictable timing of repayments  the company believes the fair value of policy loans approximates carrying value 
stable value product and annuity account balance as of december   the company estimated the fair value of stable value product account balances and annuity account balances using models based on discounted estimated cash flows 
the discount rates used in the models were based on a current market rate for similar financial instruments 
as of december   the company estimated the fair value of its stable value products and annuities using discounted cash flows and surrender values  respectively 
non recourse funding obligations as of december   the company estimated the fair value of its non recourse funding obligations using internal discounted cash flow models 
given current market conditions  the fair value of the company s non recourse funding obligations differs significantly from book value 
the discount rates used in the models was based on a current market yield for similar financial instruments 
due to the large spread between the required market yield and the current interest rate the fair value is significantly less than the carrying amount 
as of december   the company estimated the fair value of its non recourse funding obligations to approximate carrying value 
the company has changed the valuation methodology for annuity account balances and non recourse debt obligations from the prior year to comply with the guidance set forth in sfas no 
operating segments the company operates several business segments each having a strategic focus 
an operating segment is distinguished by products  channels of distribution  and or other strategic distinctions 
the company periodically evaluates its operating segments in light of the segment reporting requirements prescribed by fasb statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  and makes adjustments to its segment reporting as needed 
a brief description of each segment follows 
the life marketing segment markets level premium term insurance traditional  ul  variable universal life and boli products on a national basis primarily through networks of independent insurance agents and brokers  stockbrokers  and independent marketing organizations 
the acquisitions segment focuses on acquiring  converting  and servicing policies acquired from other companies 
the segment s primary focus is on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals 
in the ordinary course of business  the acquisitions segment regularly considers acquisitions of blocks of policies or smaller insurance companies 
the level of the segment s acquisition activity is predicated upon many factors  including available capital  operating capacity  and market dynamics 
policies acquired through the acquisition segment are closed blocks of business no new policies are being marketed 
therefore  earnings and account values are expected to decline 
the annuities segment manufactures  sells  and supports fixed and variable annuity products 
these products are primarily sold through broker dealers  but are also sold through financial institutions and independent agents and brokers 
the stable value products segment sells gfas to special purpose entities that in turn issue notes or certificates in smaller  transferable denominations 
the segment also markets fixed and floating rate funding agreements directly to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds  institutional investors  bank trust departments  and money market funds 
additionally  the segment markets gics to k and other qualified retirement savings plans 
the asset protection segment primarily markets extended service contracts and credit life and disability insurance to protect consumers investments in automobiles  watercraft  and recreational vehicles 
in addition  the segment markets a guaranteed asset protection product and an inventory protection product 
the corporate and other segment primarily consists of net investment income and expenses not attributable to the segments above including net investment income on capital and interest on debt 
this segment also includes earnings from several non strategic lines of business primarily cancer insurance  residual value insurance  surety insurance  and group annuities  various investment related transactions  and the operations of several small subsidiaries 
the company uses the same accounting policies and procedures to measure segment operating income loss and assets as it uses to measure consolidated net income loss and assets 
segment operating income loss is income loss before income tax excluding net realized investment gains and losses net of the related amortization of dac voba and participating income from real estate ventures  and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
periodic settlements of derivatives associated with corporate debt and certain investments and annuity products are included in realized gains and losses but are considered part of operating income because the derivatives are used to mitigate risk in items affecting consolidated and segment operating income loss 
segment operating income loss represents the basis on which the performance of the company s business is internally assessed by management 
premiums and policy fees  other income  benefits and settlement expenses  and amortization of dac voba are attributed directly to each operating segment 
net investment income is allocated based on directly related assets required for transacting the business of that segment 
realized investment gains losses and other operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner that most appropriately reflects the operations of that segment 
investments and other assets are allocated based on statutory policy liabilities  while dac voba and goodwill are shown in the segments to which they are attributable 
there were no significant intersegment transactions during or

in the opinion of management  all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring items necessary for a fair statement of quarterly results have been reflected in the following data 
it is also management s opinion  however  that quarterly operating data for insurance enterprises are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in succeeding quarters or years

summary of significant accounting policies valuation of investment securities the fair value for fixed maturity  short term  and equity securities  is determined by management after considering and evaluating one of three primary sources of information third party pricing services  independent broker quotations  or pricing matrices 
security pricing is applied using a waterfall approach whereby publicly available prices are first sought from third party pricing services  the remaining unpriced securities are submitted to independent brokers for prices  or lastly  securities are priced using a pricing matrix 
typical inputs used by these three pricing methods include  but are not limited to reported trades  benchmark yields  issuer spreads  bids  offers  and or estimated cash flows and rates of prepayments 
based on the typical trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices for fixed maturities  third party pricing services will normally derive the security prices through recent reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information as outlined above 
if there are no recent reported trades  the third party pricing services and brokers may use matrix or model processes to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are developed based upon collateral performance and discounted at an estimated market rate 
included in the pricing of asset backed securities abs  collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and mortgage backed securities mbs are estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
such estimates are derived based on the characteristics of the underlying structure and rates of prepayments previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral 
determining whether a decline in the current fair value of invested assets is an other than temporary decline in value can involve a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded in established markets 
for example  assessing the value of certain investments requires that the company performs an analysis of expected future cash flows or rates of prepayments 
other investments  such as collateralized mortgage or bond obligations  represent selected tranches of a structured transaction  supported in the aggregate by underlying investments in a wide variety of issuers 
management considers a number of factors when determining the impairment status of individual securities 
these include the economic condition of various industry segments and geographic locations and other areas of identified risks 
although it is possible for the impairment of one investment to affect other investments  the company engages in ongoing risk management to safeguard against and limit any further risk to our investment portfolio 
special attention is given to correlative risks within specific industries  related parties  and business markets 
the company considers a number of factors in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
these include  but are not limited to actions taken by rating agencies  default by the issuer  the significance of the decline in fair value  the intent and ability to hold the investment until recovery  the time period during which the decline has occurred  an economic analysis of the issuer s industry  and the financial strength  liquidity  and recoverability of the issuer 
management performs a security by security review each quarter in evaluating the need for any other than temporary impairments 
although no set formula is used in this process  the investment performance  collateral position  and continued viability of the issuer are significant measures considered 
for the years ended december  and  the company did not record any pre tax other than temporary impairments 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill at least annually and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company utilized a discounted cash flows model to assess the fair value of the reporting units 
as of december  and  the company evaluated goodwill and determined that fair value had not decreased below carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

as of december   the company had goodwill of million 
in addition  in light of the decrease in the company s market capitalization market cap during the fourth quarter of  the company reviewed the underlying factors causing the market cap decrease to determine if the market cap fluctuation would be indicative of an additional factor to consider in its goodwill impairment testing  as such a decline in the market cap or market value of an entity s securities may or may not be indicative of a triggering event which could require the company to perform an interim or event driven impairment analysis 
in the company s view  the reduction in market cap is primarily attributable to illiquidity of credit markets and capital markets  concern related to our investment portfolio s unrealized loss positions  impairments recognized during  and an overall fear of the capital levels and potential economic impacts to financial services companies 
as a result  in the company s view  the decrease in market cap does not invalidate the company s discounted cash flow results 
property and equipment property and equipment are reported at cost  including interest capitalized during any acquisition or development period  less accumulated depreciation 
the company primarily uses the straight line method of depreciation based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company s home office building is depreciated over a thirty nine year useful life  furniture is depreciated over a ten year useful life  office equipment and machines are depreciated over a five year useful life  and software and computers are depreciated over a three year useful life 
major repairs or improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
other repairs are expensed as incurred 
the cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment sold or retired are removed from the accounts  and resulting gains or losses are included in income 
derivative financial instruments the company utilizes a risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate risk  inflation risk  currency exchange risk  and equity market risk 
these strategies are developed through the asset liability committee s analysis of data from financial simulation models and other internal and industry sources and are then incorporated into the company s risk management program 
derivative instruments expose the company to credit and market risk and could result in material changes from period to period 
the company minimizes its credit risk by entering into transactions with highly rated counterparties 
the company manages the market risk associated with interest rate and foreign exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degrees of risk that may be undertaken 
the company monitors its use of derivatives in connection with its overall asset liability management programs and strategies 
derivative instruments that are used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps  interest rate futures  interest rate options  and interest rate swaptions 
the company s inflation risk management strategy involves the use of swaps that requires the company to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate that is based on changes in the consumer price index cpi 
the company uses foreign currency swaps to manage its exposure to changes in the value of foreign currency denominated stable value contracts 
the company also uses s p options to mitigate its exposure to the value of equity indexed annuity contracts 
the company has sold credit default protection on liquid traded indices to enhance the return on its investment portfolio 
these credit default swaps create credit exposure similar to an investment in publicly issued fixed maturity cash investments 
the credit default swaps relate to the high yield series index and the investment grade series index and have terms to june and december  respectively 
defaults within the high yield series index that exceeded the attachment point would require the company to perform under the credit default swaps  up to the exhaustion point 
defaults within the investment grade series index that exceeded the attachment point would require the company to perform under the credit default swaps  up to the exhaustion point 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted that the company could be required to make under the credit derivatives is million 
as of december   the fair value of the credit derivatives was a liability of million 
as a result of the ongoing disruption in the credit markets  the fair value of these derivatives has fluctuated in response to changing market conditions 
the company believes that the unrealized loss recorded on the million notional of credit default swaps is not indicative of the economic value of the investment 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value 
the company records its derivative instruments on the balance sheet in other long term investments and other liabilities 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments  a company must designate the hedging instrument  based upon the exposure being hedged  as a fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or a hedge related to foreign currency exposure 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss realized on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction impacts earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on these derivatives is recognized as ineffectiveness in current earnings during the period of the change 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings during the period of change in fair values 
effectiveness of the company s hedge relationships is assessed on a quarterly basis 
the company accounts for changes in fair values of derivatives that are not part of a qualifying hedge relationship through earnings in the period of change 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are recognized in current earnings are reported in realized investment gains losses derivative financial instruments 
other derivatives the company also uses various other derivative instruments for risk management purposes that either do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or have not currently been qualified by the company for hedge accounting treatment 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings during the period of change 
the company uses interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate payments on certain of its debt obligations to a floating rate 
interest is exchanged periodically on the notional value  with the company receiving the fixed rate and paying various libor based rates 
in   and  the company recognized pre tax gains of million  million  and million respectively  representing the change in value of these derivatives and related net settlements 
the company had also entered into a total return swap in connection with a portfolio of investment securities managed by the company for an unrelated party 
the company recognized pre tax losses of million and million  and a million pre tax gain in   and  respectively  for the change in the total return swap s fair value 
the total return swap was terminated in september of no total return swaps remain outstanding 
during  the company entered into credit default swaps to enhance the return on its investment portfolio 
the company recognized a pre tax loss of million and a pre tax gain of million in and  respectively  from the change in the swaps fair value and positions closed 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
income tax provisions are generally based on income reported for financial statement purposes 
deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities determined for financial reporting purposes and the basis determined for income tax purposes 
such temporary differences are principally related to the marking to market value of investment assets  the deferral of policy acquisition costs  and the provision for future policy benefits and expenses 
the company analyzes whether it needs to establish a valuation allowance on each of its deferred tax assets 
in performing this analysis  the company first considers the need for a valuation allowance on each separate deferred tax asset 
ultimately  it analyzes this need in the aggregate in order to prevent the double counting of expected future taxable income in each of the foregoing separate analyses
