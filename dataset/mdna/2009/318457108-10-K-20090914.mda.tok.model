item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the caption item a 
risk factors 
general we are principally a retailer  servicer and underwriter of non standard personal automobile insurance 
we also own two tracts of land in san antonio  texas that are held for sale 
non standard personal automobile insurance is made available to individuals who are categorized as non standard because of their inability or unwillingness to obtain standard insurance coverage due to various factors  including payment history  payment preference  failure in the past to maintain continuous insurance coverage  driving record and or vehicle type 
generally  our customers are required by law to buy a minimum amount of automobile insurance 
as of september   we leased and operated retail locations or stores  staffed by employee agents 
our employee agents exclusively sell non standard automobile insurance products underwritten by us 
as of september   we wrote non standard personal automobile insurance in states and were licensed in additional states 
the following table shows the number of our retail locations 
retail location counts are based upon the date that a location commenced or ceased writing business

we conduct our underwriting operations through three insurance company subsidiaries first acceptance insurance company  inc  first acceptance insurance company of georgia  inc 
and first acceptance insurance company of tennessee  inc our insurance revenues are primarily generated from premiums earned  including policy and renewal fees  from sales of policies written and assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries  commission and fee income  including installment billing fees on policies written  agency fees and commissions and fees for other ancillary products and services  and investment income earned on the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries

table of contents first acceptance corporation k the following table presents the change in the total number of policies in force for the insurance operations 
policies in force increase as a result of new policies issued and decrease as a result of policies that are canceled or expire and are not renewed 
year ended june  policies in force beginning of period net increase decrease during period policies in force end of period insurance companies present a combined ratio as a measure of their overall underwriting profitability 
the components of the combined ratio are as follows 
loss ratio loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability 
we calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned 
expense ratio expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of operating expenses to premiums earned 
this is a measurement that illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations 
combined ratio combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income 
the following table presents the loss  expense and combined ratios for our insurance operations 
year ended june  loss and loss adjustment expense expense combined the non standard personal automobile insurance industry is cyclical in nature 
likewise  adverse economic conditions impact our customers and many will choose to reduce their coverage or go uninsured during a weak economy 
in the past  the industry has been characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity 
if new competitors enter this market  existing competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates 
such conditions could lead to reduced prices  which would negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k investments we use the services of an independent investment manager to manage our fixed maturities investment portfolio 
the investment manager conducts  in accordance with our investment policy  all of the investment purchases and sales for our insurance company subsidiaries 
our investment policy has been established by the investment committee of our board of directors and specifically addresses overall investment goals and objectives  authorized investments  prohibited securities  restrictions on sales by the investment manager and guidelines as to asset allocation  duration and credit quality 
this policy currently does not allow investments in equity securities 
management and the investment committee meet regularly with our investment manager to review the performance of the portfolio and compliance with our investment guidelines 
the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries consist substantially of marketable  investment grade  us government securities  municipal bonds  corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
we also invest a portion of the portfolio in certain securities issued by political subdivisions which enable our insurance company subsidiaries to obtain premium tax credits 
investment income is comprised primarily of interest earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
realized gains and losses may occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings to obtain premium tax credits or based upon changes in interest rates or the credit quality of specific securities 
during the fiscal year  we sold securities with unrealized gains to generate taxable income in order to utilize expiring tax nol carryforwards 
the value of our consolidated investment portfolio was million at june  and consisted of fixed maturity securities  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity on an after tax basis 
at june   we had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
at june   of the fair value of our investment portfolio was rated investment grade a credit rating of aaa to bbb by standard poor s corporation  a nationally recognized rating agency 
the average credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was aa at june  investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and have lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non investment grade 
management believes that a high quality investment portfolio is more likely to generate a stable and predictable investment return 
investments in cmos were million at june  and represented of our fixed maturity portfolio 
as of june   of our cmos were considered investment grade by each of the nationally recognized rating agencies 
in addition  of our cmos were rated aaa and of our cmos were backed by agencies of the united states government

loss before income taxes for the year ended june  was million  compared with a loss before income taxes of million for the year ended june  the loss before income taxes for the year ended june  included a goodwill impairment charge of million 
net loss for the year ended june  was million  compared with a net loss of million for the year ended june  the net loss for the year ended june  included a net charge of million resulting from the million tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge and the establishment of a full valuation allowance on the remaining deferred tax assets offset by a tax benefit of million related to the utilization of federal nol carryforwards that were to expire on june  that had been previously reserved for through a valuation allowance 
basic and diluted net loss per share was for the year ended june   compared with basic and diluted net loss per share of for the year ended june  insurance operations revenues from insurance operations were million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june  loss before income taxes from insurance operations for the year ended june  was million  compared with income before income taxes from insurance operations of million for the year ended june  premiums earned premiums earned decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease in premiums earned was primarily due to the weak economic conditions  which have caused both a decline in the number of policies written  as well as an increase in the percentage of our customers purchasing liability only coverage 
rate actions taken in a number of states to improve underwriting profitability and the closure of underperforming stores also contributed toward the decrease in policies written and premiums earned 
approximately of the million decline in premiums earned for the year ended june  was in our florida  georgia  south carolina and texas markets 
the total number of insured policies in force at june  decreased over the same date in from  to  primarily due to the factors noted above 
at june   we operated stores  compared with stores at june  commission and fee income commission and fee income decreased to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease was a result of the decrease in the number of policies in force  partially offset by higher fee income related to commissionable products sold through our network of retail locations 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k investment income investment income decreased to million during the year ended june  from million during the year ended june  primarily as a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease in the amount of assets invested in fixed maturities and the significant decline in yields on cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents increased from million at june  to million at june  primarily as a result of the sale of million of us government and agency securities and agency backed cmos in march to generate taxable income in order to utilize expiring net operating losses 
the proceeds from these sales had not been reinvested as of june  at june  and  the tax equivalent book yields for our fixed maturities and cash equivalents portfolio were and  respectively  with effective durations of and years  respectively  which both declined as a result of the increase in cash equivalents previously discussed 
net realized gains losses on fixed maturities  available for sale net realized gains losses on fixed maturities  available for sale during the year ended june  included million in net realized gains from the sale of million of us government and agency securities and agency backed cmos in march as previously noted 
net realized gains losses on fixed maturities  available for sale included million of charges related to other than temporary impairment otti on investments  which was comprised of million related to certain non agency backed cmos and million related to three corporate bonds 
effective april   we adopted the provisions of staff position  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
under this guidance  we separate otti into the following two components i the amount related to credit losses which is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and ii the amount related to all other factors which is recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the credit related portion of an otti is measured by comparing a security s amortized cost to the present value of its current expected cash flows discounted at its effective yield at the date of acquisition 
as a result of the adoption of this pronouncement  the cumulative effect resulted in an adjustment of million to reclassify the non credit component of previously recognized impairments from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
we routinely monitor our fixed maturities portfolio for changes in fair value that might indicate potential impairments and perform detailed reviews on such securities 
changes in fair value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer or ii market related factors such as interest rates or sector declines 
securities with declines attributable to issuer specific fundamentals are reviewed to identify all available evidence to estimate the potential for impairment 
resources used include historical financial data included in sec filings for corporate bonds and performance data regarding the underlying loans for cmos 
securities with declines attributable solely to market or sector declines where we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before the full recovery of its amortized cost basis are not deemed to be other than temporary 
the issuer specific factors considered in reaching the conclusion that securities with declines are not other than temporary include i the extent and duration of the decline in fair value  including the duration of any significant decline in value  ii whether the security is current as to payments of principal and interest  iii a valuation of any underlying collateral  iv current and future conditions and trends for both the business and its industry  v changes in cash flow assumptions for cmos and vi rating agency actions 
based on these factors  we will make a determination as to the probability of recovering principal and interest on the security 
on a quarterly basis  we review cash flow estimates for certain non agency backed cmos of lesser credit quality following the guidance of fsp eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
fsp eitf 
accordingly  when changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  and the present value of the revised cash flows is less than the present value previously estimated  otti is deemed to have occurred 
for non agency backed cmos not subject to fsp eitf  we prepare quarterly projected cash flow analyses and when it is indicated that a principal loss is probable  otti is deemed to have occurred 
the timing of projected cash flows on cmos has changed as economic conditions have prevented the underlying borrowers from refinancing the mortgages 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k underlying these securities  thereby reducing the amount of projected prepayments 
likewise  economic conditions have caused an increase in the actual and projected delinquencies in the underlying mortgages 
these factors have resulted in the otti that we have recognized related to non agency backed cmos 
our review of non agency backed cmos included an analysis of available information such as collateral quality  anticipated cash flows  credit enhancements  default rates  loss severities  the securities relative position in their respective capital structures  and credit ratings from statistical rating agencies 
we review quarterly projected cash flow analyses for each security utilizing current assumptions regarding i actual and anticipated delinquencies  ii delinquency transition to default rates  and iii loss severities 
based on our quarterly reviews  we determined that there had not been adverse changes in projected cash flows  except in the case of those securities previously discussed which incurred otti charges 
we believe that the unrealized losses on these securities are not necessarily predictive of the ultimate performance of the underlying collateral 
we do not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis 
the otti charges on corporate bonds was recognized as these bonds were considered to be impaired based on the extent and duration of the declines in their fair values and issuer specific fundamentals relating to i poor operating results and weakened financial conditions  ii negative industry trends further impacted by the recent economic decline  and iii a series of downgrades to their credit ratings 
based on the factors that existed at the time of impairment  we did not believe that these bonds would recover their unrealized losses in the near future 
we believe that the remaining securities having unrealized losses at june  were not other than temporarily impaired 
we also do not intend to sell any of these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell any of these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis 
loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was for the year ended june   compared with for the year ended june  for the year ended june   we experienced favorable development of approximately million for losses occurring prior to june  the favorable development for the year ended june  was due to lower than anticipated severity and frequency of accidents in the states in which we operate 
excluding the development noted above  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the year ended june  was 
the year over year improvement reflects among other things  favorable severity trends in property and physical damage coverages  rate actions taken in a number of states to improve underwriting profitability  improvement in our underwriting and claim handling practices  and the shift in business mix toward renewal policies  which have lower loss ratios than new policies 
operating expenses insurance operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in costs such as employee agent commissions and premium taxes that varied along with the decrease in premiums earned as well as savings realized from the closure of underperforming stores 
the expense ratio increased from for the year ended june  to for fiscal year the year over year increase in the expense ratio was due to the drop in revenues  which resulted in a higher percentage of fixed expenses such as rent and base salary 
overall  the combined ratio decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  
table of contents first acceptance corporation k litigation settlement litigation settlement costs for the years ended june  and of million and million  respectively  relate to the costs incurred in connection with our settlement and defense of the litigation filed against us in georgia and alabama relating to certain sales practices 
pursuant to these litigation settlements  we have i provided the plaintiffs with either a premium credit towards a future automobile insurance policy or a reimbursement certificate for future towing and rental expenses  ii paid an aggregate of million in fees and expenses for the attorneys for the plaintiffs and iii agreed to pay the costs associated with the administration of the settlements 
at this time  we are unable to estimate the costs associated with the georgia and alabama litigation settlements related to the utilization of reimbursement certificates 
however  sufficient information related to the premium credits has existed since december  to allow us to reasonably estimate and accrue the total costs associated with the utilization of available premium credits 
the final costs of the settlements will depend on  among other factors  the rate of redemption and forfeiture of the premium credits and reimbursement certificates 
regarding the georgia and alabama settlements  based upon our analysis of the premium credits available to class members at december   we accrued approximately million associated with the estimated utilization of available premium credits for georgia and alabama class members who were insured by the company on december  and received the premium credits 
since january   million of available premium credits have been utilized and million have been forfeited 
we are not able to reasonably estimate and  therefore  did not accrue any estimated costs for georgia and alabama class members that were not insured by the company on june  that received the premium credits as a result of the uncertainties associated with those class members purchasing a new automobile insurance policy from the company and utilizing the approximately million of premium credits available to them 
the litigation settlement costs are set forth separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended june   we paid million in fees and expenses to the attorneys for the georgia and alabama plaintiffs and million in costs associated with the administration of the settlements  all of which were accrued at june  during the year ended june   we incurred an additional million in legal costs in connection with the defense of the litigation 
we have a remaining accrual as of june  for those currently estimable costs associated with the utilization of available premium credits of million 
management intends to adjust the estimated accrual as necessary during future periods to account for the impact of actual rate of redemption and forfeiture of the premium credits and reimbursement certificates 
in july  we received million from our insurance carrier regarding coverage for the costs and expenses we incurred relating to the settlement of the georgia and alabama litigation 
this insurance recovery was accrued in fiscal year and included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and as a reduction of litigation settlement expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
for additional information with respect to the litigation settlements  see item legal proceedings and note to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment we recorded a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal year of million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform periodic impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts  and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of those assets and liabilities  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment  if any  by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
as a result of the adverse impact of the difficult economic conditions on our customers and our business and the resulting decline in our share price during the most recent quarter  we have estimated that a goodwill impairment charge would be required upon the completion of a 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k detailed allocation of the reporting unit fair values 
accordingly  we recognized a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to the complexity of the fair value calculations involved  it is expected that the goodwill impairment charge will be finalized by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year and it is not expected to differ materially from this estimate 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting unit  from a market participant s perspective  included i long term revenue growth rates ranging from to  ii a discount rate of  which was based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with our operations  and iii recent industry transaction trends in price to tangible book multiples and related returns on tangible equity 
we do not believe that the estimated goodwill impairment charge will have a materially adverse impact on the continuing operations  liquidity  or statutory surplus of the company 
a variance in the discount rate could have had a significant effect on the amount of the estimated goodwill impairment charge recognized 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have caused an increase or decrease in the estimated goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
our evaluation includes multiple assumptions  including estimated discounted cash flows and other estimates that may change over time 
if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by us  further impairment charges may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as quoted market prices in active stock markets are relevant evidence of fair value  a significant decrease in our common stock trading price could also indicate that an impairment of goodwill exists 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for the same period in fiscal year as a result of the goodwill impairment charge  we are in a cumulative pre tax loss over a three year period 
in assessing our ability to support the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we have considered both positive and negative evidence 
we have placed greater weight on the uncertainty associated with the current economic challenges and the related goodwill impairment charge 
therefore  we have established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets which  in combination with the tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge  resulted in a net increase in the tax provision of million during the three months ended june  this charge was partially offset by a million tax benefit related to the utilization of tax nol carryforwards expiring in that had been previously reserved for through a valuation allowance resulting in a net increase in the tax provision for the year of million 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  included a charge of million related to the expiration of certain federal nol carryforwards as well as an increase in the valuation allowance of million for the deferred tax asset for certain federal nol carryforwards resulting in a charge totaling million 
the changes during the year ended june  related to the valuation allowance were due to i revisions in estimates for our future taxable income based on the most recent fiscal year results and ii taxable income for the most recent fiscal year being less than our prior estimates 
real estate and corporate loss before income taxes for the year ended june  was million  compared with a loss before income taxes of million for the year ended june  segment losses consist of other operating expenses not directly related to the insurance operations  interest expense and stock based compensation offset by investment income on corporate invested assets 
during the year ended june   we incurred million of interest expense in connection with credit facility borrowings compared with million for the year ended june  the credit facility was repaid in full and terminated on october  we incurred million of interest expense during both the year ended june  and related to the debentures issued in june year ended june  compared with the year ended june  consolidated results revenues for the year ended june  decreased to million from million in the prior year 
net loss for the year ended june  was million  compared with a net loss of million for the 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k year ended june  basic and diluted net loss per share was for the year ended june   compared with for the year ended june  insurance operations revenues from insurance operations were million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june  income before income taxes from insurance operations for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for the year ended june  premiums earned premiums earned decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  this decline was due to the decrease in the number of policies written  which was partially offset by higher average premiums per policy as a result of rate increases taken in a number of states to improve underwriting profitability 
the decrease in the policies written was due to the weak economic conditions that impacted our customers  rate increases taken in a number of states to improve underwriting profitability and the closure of poor performing stores between january and june  premiums earned in florida  georgia and tennessee for the year ended june  declined by million over the same period in the prior fiscal year 
these markets collectively accounted for of premiums earned during fiscal year  down from in the prior year 
our premiums earned in these states were adversely affected by a decline in used car sales  which had historically been a significant contributor to new policy growth in these markets 
additionally  the decline in our florida market was due to a january  rate increase to improve our underwriting profitability and the decline in our georgia market was due to state legislation intended to curb illegal immigration 
the decline in premiums earned was partially offset by premium growth of million in our south carolina and pennsylvania markets 
the total number of insured policies in force at june  decreased over the same date in from  to  at june   we operated stores  compared with stores at june  commission and fee income commission and fee income decreased to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease was a result of the decrease in policies in force during fiscal year partially offset by higher fee income in illinois and florida 
investment income investment income increased during the year ended june  as invested assets increased as a result of cash provided by operating activities and the proceeds received from the sale of debentures in june the tax equivalent book yields for our fixed maturities and cash equivalents portfolio were and at june  and  respectively  with effective durations of years and years at june  and  respectively 
net realized gains losses on fixed maturities  available for sale included in net realized gains losses on fixed maturities  available for sale during the year ended june  were million of charges related to the otti of certain non agency cmos in our investment portfolio 
due to the deterioration in liquidity in the credit markets during calendar year  yields on certain non agency cmos declined below projected book yields  which required the million impairment of these securities under the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets 
other other revenues for the year ended june  are comprised of million in transaction service fees earned for servicing the run off business previously written by the chicago non standard insurance agencies whose 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k assets we acquired in january we received the transaction service fee from the effective date of the acquisition in january through december  loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was for the year ended june   compared with for the same period in fiscal year during fiscal year  we experienced a higher than anticipated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio primarily as a result of significant unanticipated increases in i the frequency of personal injury protection pip coverage losses in florida  ii the severity of bodily injury losses in florida and georgia  and iii the severity of property damage losses in georgia and other states 
this higher than anticipated severity in georgia bodily injury losses in fiscal year was driven by a higher than anticipated occurrence of large losses losses of  or above 
additionally  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for fiscal year improved due to rate increases in florida taken in connection with the reinstatement of florida s motor vehicle no fault law pip coverage 
this law and the related coverage expired september  but was reinstated effective january  our loss ratio exclusive of loss adjustment expenses for florida s pip coverage improved to for the year ended june  from for the prior fiscal year 
premiums earned on florida s pip coverage decreased to million from million over the same period 
for the year ended june   we experienced favorable development for prior accident periods of approximately million 
for the year ended june   we experienced negative development for losses occurring in prior accident periods of approximately million 
the favorable development for the year ended june  was due to lower than anticipated severity and frequency of accidents in certain states in which we operate 
there was no individual factor that had a material impact on our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the year ended june  the estimation process for the year ended june  was impacted by our limited historical loss experience in our newer states which required more judgment in determining our loss reserve estimates for those states 
excluding development for prior accident periods  for those premiums earned during the years ended june  and  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios were and  respectively 
we believe that this improvement was the result of i the absence of the negative factors experienced during fiscal year  ii the impact of rate increases taken during fiscal year in florida january  indiana february  texas march and south carolina may and iii improvements in our underwriting and claim handling practices 
operating expenses insurance operating expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily a result of i severance and related benefits charges of million incurred in connection with separation agreements with certain officers and retail management personnel  ii expenses of million associated with the closure of poor performing stores and iii costs relating to the increased investment in our product  actuarial and information technology functions to support our rate making capabilities 
the increased costs were partially offset by cost savings related to the decline in the number of active retail locations 
the expense ratio increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to the year over year decline in premiums earned and the net effect of the expenses discussed above which had a negative impact of basis points on the expense ratio during the year ended june  and the positive impact on the expense ratio during the year ended june  from the transaction service fee of million  or basis points  earned through december  in connection with the chicago acquisition

the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  includes an increase in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset of million as well as million related to the expiration of certain nol carryforwards resulting in a deferred tax asset charge totaling million 
the changes during the years ended june  and related to the valuation allowance were due to revisions in estimates for our future taxable income 
the charges during the years ended june  and related to the expiration of nol carryforwards were due to taxable income for fiscal year being less than our prior estimates 
real estate and corporate loss before income taxes for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for the year ended june  during the year ended june   interest expense in connection with borrowings under our credit facility decreased to million from million during the year ended june  as a result of lower outstanding indebtedness

the national association of insurance commissioners model act for risk based capital provides formulas to determine the amount of statutory capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
there are statutory guidelines that suggest that on an annual calendar year basis  the insurance company subsidiaries should not exceed a ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus of to we believe that our insurance company subsidiaries have sufficient financial resources available to support their net premium writings in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
the following are considered to be our critical accounting estimates 
valuation of deferred tax asset we maintain income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting estimate because the determination of our ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value and  therefore  the carrying amount of our deferred tax asset 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are attributable to our insurance operations and were initially recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not amortized for financial statement purposes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform our annual impairment tests as of the last day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may be impaired  an interim impairment test would be required 
intangible assets with finite lives have been fully amortized over their useful lives 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts  and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of those assets and liabilities  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment  if any  by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
our evaluation includes multiple assumptions  including estimated discounted cash flows and other estimates that may change over time 
if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by us  further impairment charges may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as quoted market prices in active stock markets are relevant evidence of fair value  a significant decrease in our common stock trading price could also indicate that an impairment of goodwill exists 
investments our investments are recorded at fair value  which is typically based on publicly available quoted prices 
from time to time  the carrying value of our investments may be temporarily impaired because of the inherent volatility of publicly traded investments 
management reviews investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
a decline in the fair value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary would result in a charge against income for the credit related portion of any such impairment 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
we routinely monitor our fixed maturities portfolio for changes in fair value that might indicate potential impairments and perform detailed reviews on such securities 
changes in fair value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer or ii market related factors such as interest rates or sector declines 
securities with declines attributable to issuer specific fundamentals are reviewed to identify all available evidence to estimate the potential for impairment 
resources used include historical financial data included in sec filings for corporate bonds and performance data regarding the underlying loans for cmos 
securities with declines attributable to market or sector declines where we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis are not deemed to be other than temporary 
losses and loss adjustment expense reserves loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to events that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not been paid 
months and potentially years may elapse between the occurrence of an automobile accident covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the accident and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for accidents that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
as accidents are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for accidents that have occurred but have not been reported 
we are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies that our insurance company subsidiaries underwrite 
each of the insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k all of its unpaid losses  including case reserves and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we estimate our ibnr reserves by estimating our ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves first  and then reducing that amount by the amount of cumulative paid claims and by the amount of our case reserves 
we rely primarily on historical loss experience in determining reserve levels  on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience 
we also consider various other factors  such as inflation  claims settlement patterns  legislative activity and litigation trends 
our actuarial staff continually monitors these estimates on a state and coverage level 
we utilize our actuarial staff to determine appropriate reserve levels 
as experience develops or new information becomes known  we increase or decrease the level of our reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is exposed primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates  generally  the fair value of fixed income investments moves inversely with movements in market interest rates 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
this portfolio composition allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of our insurance company subsidiaries are managed to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k interest rate risk the fair values of our fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair values of those instruments 
additionally  the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates resulting from parallel shifts in market yield curves on our fixed maturity portfolio in thousands 
it is assumed that the effects are realized immediately upon the change in interest rates 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table
