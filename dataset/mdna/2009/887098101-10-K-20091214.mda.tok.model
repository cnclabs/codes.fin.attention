critical accounting policies and estimates the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified five policies  that as a result of judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights msrs  the determination of other than temporary impairments in the market value of investment securities  the determination of goodwill impairment and the determination of the recorded value of other real estate owned 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussion and analysis contained herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in particular  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  generally describes the company s accounting policies 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
the allowance is based upon management s comprehensive analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the amount and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes methods to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the appropriate allowance for loan loss level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights are capitalized when acquired through the origination of loans that are subsequently sold with servicing rights retained and are amortized to servicing income on loans sold in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
the value of msrs at the date of the sale of loans is determined based on the discounted present value of expected future cash flows using key assumptions for servicing income and costs and prepayment rates on the underlying loans 
the estimated fair value is evaluated at least annually by a third party firm for impairment by comparing actual cash flows and estimated cash flows from the servicing assets to those estimated at the time servicing assets were originated 
the effect of changes in market interest rates on estimated rates of loan prepayments represents the predominant risk characteristic underlying the msrs portfolio 
the company s methodology for estimating the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
for example  the determination of fair value uses anticipated prepayment speeds 
actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on the fair value 
thus  any measurement of msrs fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions as of the date made 
those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at different times 
ottis other than temporary impairments in the market value of investment securities 
unrealized investment securities losses on available for sale and held to maturity securities are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether declines in value should be considered other than temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition through earnings for the portion related to credit losses 
although these evaluations involve significant judgment  an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the security is below the recorded value primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  when there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  and the company has the intent and the ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded value 
an unrealized loss in the value of an equity security is generally considered temporary when the fair value of the security is below the recorded value primarily as a result of current market conditions and not a result of deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer or the underlying collateral in the case of mutual funds and the company has the intent and the ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded value 
other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of either a debt or equity security is other than temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies  capital strength and near term prospects of the issuer  and recommendation of investment advisors or market analysts 
therefore  continued deterioration of current market conditions could result in additional impairment losses recognized within the company s investment portfolio 
goodwill 
goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is analyzed annually for impairment 
an annual review is performed at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the company s sole reporting unit exceeds the recorded value of the reporting unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary 
one of the circumstances evaluated when determining if an impairment test of goodwill is needed more frequently than annually is the extent and duration that the company s market capitalization total common shares outstanding multiplied by current stock price is less than the total equity applicable to common shareholders 
during the quarter ended march   the company s market capitalization decreased to a level that required a goodwill impairment test prior to the annual test 
therefore  the company engaged a third party firm to perform an interim test for goodwill impairment during the quarter ended march  the test concluded that recorded goodwill was not impaired 
the company updated the interim test for goodwill impairment internally during the quarter ended june  and concluded that recorded goodwill was not impaired 
as of september   there have been no events or changes in the circumstances that would indicate a potential impairment 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future 
other real estate owned and other repossessed items 
other real estate owned and other repossessed items consist of properties or assets acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure  and are recorded initially at the fair value of the properties less estimated costs of disposal 
costs relating to development and improvement of the properties or assets are capitalized while costs relating to holding the properties or assets are expensed 
valuations are periodically performed by management  and a charge to earnings is recorded if the recorded value of a property exceeds its estimated net realizable value 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
operating strategy the company is a bank holding company which operates primarily through its subsidiary  the bank 
the bank is a community oriented bank which has traditionally offered a wide variety of savings products to its retail customers while concentrating its lending activities on real estate loans 
the primary elements of the bank s operating strategy include diversify primary market area by expanding branch office network 
in an effort to lessen its dependence on the grays harbor county market whose economy has historically been tied to the timber and fishing industries  the bank has opened branch offices in pierce  king  thurston and kitsap counties 
pierce  king  thurston and kitsap counties contain the olympia  bremerton  and seattle tacoma metropolitan areas and their economies are more diversified with the presence of government  aerospace and computer technology industries 
in october  the bank continued its geographic diversification by acquiring two branches in lewis county as part of a seven branch acquisition 
in august  the bank announced plans to open an additional full service branch in lewis county  which opened in may with the construction of this new branch office  the bank s existing loan production office in lewis county was consolidated into the new facility 
limit exposure to interest rate risk 
in recent years  a majority of the loans that the bank has retained in its portfolio generally have periodic interest rate adjustment features or have been relatively short term in nature 
loans originated for portfolio retention primarily have included arm loans and short term construction loans 
longer term fixed rate mortgage loans have generally been originated for sale in the secondary market 
management believes that the interest rate sensitivity of these adjustable rate and short term loans more closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s funding sources than other longer duration assets with fixed interest rates 
emphasize residential mortgage lending 
the bank has historically attempted to establish itself as a niche lender in its primary market areas by focusing a part of its lending activities on the origination of loans secured by one to four family residential dwellings  including loans for the construction of residential dwellings 
in an effort to meet the credit needs of borrowers in its primary market areas  the bank originates one to four family mortgage loans that do not qualify for sale in the secondary market under fhlmc guidelines 
the bank has also been an active participant in the secondary market  originating residential loans for sale to the fhlmc on a servicing retained basis 
the bank occasionally retains fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans in its portfolio for yield and asset liability management purposes 
emphasize the origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
the bank has hired additional commercial loan officers since for the purpose of increasing the bank s origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
increase the consumer loan portfolio 
in the bank hired a consumer loan specialist to increase the origination of consumer loans 
the consumer loans generated since that time have been secured primarily by real estate 
the bank expects to continue expanding its portfolio of consumer loans 
pursue low cost core deposits and deposit related fee income 
the bank has placed an emphasis on attracting commercial and personal checking accounts 
these transactional accounts typically provide a lower cost of funding than certificates of deposit accounts and generate non interest fee income 
in october  the bank increased its transaction account base by acquiring seven branches and the related deposits 
market risk and asset and liability management general 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment  deposit and borrowing activities 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the bank manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instruments nor does it engage in hedging activities 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by retaining in its portfolio  short term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustments 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms of up to six years 
the bank has adopted a strategy that is designed to substantially match the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve originating arm loans for its portfolio  maintaining residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term securities  originating fixed rate loans for retention or sale in the secondary market  and retaining the related mortgage servicing rights 
sharp increases or decreases in interest rates may adversely affect the bank s earnings 
management of the bank monitors the bank s interest rate sensitivity through the use of a model provided for the bank by fimac solutions  llc fimac  a company that specializes in providing the financial services industry interest risk rate risk and balance sheet management services 
based on a rate shock analysis prepared by fimac based on data at september   an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase the bank s projected net interest income by approximately  primarily because a larger portion of the bank s interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities would reprice within a one year period 
similarly  an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates would negatively affect net interest income by approximately  as repricing would have the opposite effect 
see quantitative aspects of market risk below for additional information 
management has sought to sustain the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
pursuant to this strategy  the bank actively originates adjustable rate loans for retention in its loan portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans with maturities greater than seven years generally are originated for the immediate or future resale in the secondary mortgage market 
at september   adjustable rate mortgage loans constituted million or  of the bank s total mortgage loan portfolio due after one year 
although the bank has sought to originate arm loans  the ability to originate such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer fixed rate loans 
consumer loans and construction and land development loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the bank s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at september   the construction and land development  and consumer loan portfolios amounted to million and million  or and of total loans receivable including loans held for sale  respectively 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the model provided for the bank by fimac estimates the changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income in response to a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the model first estimates the level of the bank s npv market value of assets  less market value of liabilities  plus or minus the market value of any off balance sheet items under the current rate environment 
in general  market values are estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows of each instrument by appropriate discount rates 
the model then recalculates the bank s npv under different interest rate scenarios 
the change in npv under the different interest rate scenarios provides a measure of the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table is provided by fimac based on data at september  net interest income current market value hypothetical interest rate estimated change change estimated change change scenario value from base from base value from base from base basis points dollars in thousands      base  does not include loan fees 
includes boli income  which is included in non interest income on the consolidated financial statements 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
furthermore  the computations do not reflect any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the bank would be expected to experience a increase in npv and a decrease in net interest income 
in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  a decrease in npv and a increase in net interest income would be expected 
based upon the modeling described above  the bank s asset and liability structure generally results in decreases in net interest income in a declining interest rate scenario and increases in net interest income in a rising rate scenario 
this structure also generally results in decreases in npv in rising rate scenarios and increases in npv in declining rate scenarios 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could possibly deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
comparison of financial condition at september  and september  the company s total assets increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily attributable to a million increase in cash equivalents and certificate of deposits held for investment  a million increase in oreo and other repossessed items  a million increase in mortgage servicing rights and a million increase in premises and equipment 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in net loans receivable and a million decrease in investment and mortgage backed securities 
this asset growth was primarily funded by a million increase in deposits increased capital from the sale of senior preferred stock 
the company s capital increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily as a result of the sale of million in senior preferred stock to the us treasury department as part of the treasury s capital purchase program 
the company remains well capitalized with a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of at september  a more detailed explanation of the changes in significant balance sheet categories follows cash equivalents and certificate of deposits held for investment cash equivalents and certificate of deposits held for investment increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase in cash equivalents was primarily due to the company s decision to increase its liquidity position 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities and fhlb stock investment and mortgage backed securities including fhlb stock decreased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the decrease was primarily as a result of regular amortization and prepayments on mortgage backed securities and a million gross impairment charge recorded on private label mortgage backed securities 
the securities on which the otti charges were recognized were acquired from the in kind redemption of the bank s investment in the amf family of mutual funds in june and the impairment charge was recorded through earnings for the credit related portion and through other comprehensive loss for the non credit related portion 
for additional details on investments and mortgage backed securities  see item  business investment activities and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
loans receivable and loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  decreased by million or to million at september  from million at september  the decrease in the portfolio was primarily a result of a million decrease in construction loans net of the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process  a million decrease in consumer loans  a million decrease in commercial business loans  a million decrease in one to four family mortgage loans and a million increase in the allowance for loan losses 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in commercial real estate loan and a million increase in land loans 
loan originations including participation interests purchased increased by to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the bank sold million in fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans during the year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  for additional information on loans  see item  business lending activities and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
premises and equipment premises and equipment increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase was primarily as a result of the construction of the bank s new branch facility in chehalis  washington and remodeling costs associated with several branch offices 
these increases were partially offset by depreciation and the sale of a portion of the bank s edgewood branch office property in lieu of an eminent domain action to facilitate a road widening project 
for additional information on premises and equipment  see item  properties and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
other real estate owned oreo oreo and other repossessed items increased by million  or  to million at september  from  at september  the balance was comprised of individual properties representing relationships 
the largest oreo property had a balance of million and consisted of a lot plat located in richland  washington 
for additional information on oreo  see item  business lending activities nonperforming assets and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
goodwill and core deposit intangible cdi the value of goodwill at million at september  remained unchanged from september  the amortized value of cdi decreased by  to  at september  from  at september  due to scheduled amortization 
the company recorded goodwill and cdi in connection with the october acquisition of seven branches and related deposits 
the company performed its annual review of goodwill as of june  and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill 
for additional information of goodwill and cdi  see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplemental data 
deposits deposits increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to a million increase in now checking account balances  a million increase in non brokered certificate of deposit account balances and a million increase in savings account balances 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in brokered certificate of deposit account balances  a million decrease in money market account balances  and a million decrease in non interest checking account balances 
for additional information on deposits  see item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds and note of the consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
fhlb advances and other borrowings fhlb advances and other borrowings increased by  or  to million at september  from million at september  as the bank used additional advances to fund a small portion of asset growth 
for additional information on borrowings  see item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds borrowings and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased by million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase was primarily a result of the sale of million in senior preferred stock to the us treasury department as part of the treasury s capital purchase program 
as part of the transaction  the company also issued warrants to the treasury to purchase up to million in common stock 
the transaction is part of the treasury s program to encourage qualified financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to businesses and consumers and to support the us economy 
also impacting shareholders equity during the year ended september  was the payment of million in cash dividends on common and preferred stock and a  increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity category 
for additional information on shareholders equity  see the consolidated statements of shareholders equity contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data 
comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and the company s net income decreased by million  or  to a net loss of  for the year ended september  from net income of million for the year ended september  income available to common stock after adjusting for the preferred stock dividend and the preferred stock discount accretion was a loss of million for the year ended september  compared to income of million available to common stock for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily as a result of increased provision for loan losses  decreased net interest income  and increased non interest expenses  which were partially offset by increased non interest income 
diluted earnings per common share decreased by to a loss of for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increased provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an increase in net charge offs  an increase in impaired loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s loan grading system  and uncertainties in real estate values in the pacific northwest 
net charge offs totaled million during the year ended september   which was equivalent to of the average outstanding loans 
the decreased net interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in non accrual loans and lower overall market interest rates  which compressed the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increased non interest expense was primarily attributable to an increase in fdic insurance expense  an increase in oreo related expenses  an increase in loan monitoring and foreclosure related expenses and increases in premises and equipment expenses 
the increased non interest income was primarily a result of increased gains on sale of loans  increased service charges on deposit accounts and increased boli net earnings partially offset by net otti losses on private label mortgage backed securities 
the increased income from loan sales was primarily a result of an increase in the dollar amount of residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market for the year ended september  the increase in loan sales was primarily attributable to lower interest rates for year fixed rate loans which increased refinancing activity 
a more detailed explanation of the income statement categories is presented below 
net income net income for the year ended september  decreased by million  or  to a net loss of  from net income of million for the year ended september  income available to common stockholders after adjusting for preferred stock dividends and preferred stock discount accretion was a loss of million  or per diluted common share for the year ended september  compared to net income of million  or per diluted common share for the year ended september  the decrease in diluted earnings per common share for the year ended september  was primarily the result of a million million net of income tax per diluted common share increase in the provision for loan losses  a million million net of income tax per diluted common share increase in non interest expense  a million million net of income tax per diluted common share decrease in net interest income and a  increase in preferred stock dividends and preferred stock accretion which decreased earnings by approximately per diluted common share 
these items were partially offset by a million increase in non interest income which increased diluted earnings per common share by approximately 
net interest income net interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in non accrual loans and lower overall market interest rates 
total interest and dividend income decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as the yield on interest earning assets decreased to from 
total average interest earning assets including non accrual loans increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  non accrual loans increased by million to million at september  from million at september  total interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  total interest bearing liabilities increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  as the yield on interest earnings assets decreased at a greater rate than funding costs decreased 
this was primarily a result of the decreasing interest rate environment which reduced yields on loans at a faster pace than the bank was able to reduce deposit and borrowing costs 
the reversal of interest income on loans placed on non accrual status contributed to the margin compression and reduced the net interest margin by approximately basis points for the year ended september  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increased provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an increase in net charge offs  an increase in impaired loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s loan grading system  and uncertainties in the housing market in certain markets of the pacific northwest 
the bank had net charge offs of million for the year ended september  compared to net charge offs of  for the year ended september  the net charge offs to average outstanding loans ratio was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  the bank has established a comprehensive methodology for determining the provision for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the bank performs an analysis taking into consideration pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the amount and composition of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  a detailed analysis of individual loans on non accrual status  and other factors to determine the level of the allowance for loan losses 
management s analysis  however  for the year ended september   placed a greater emphasis on the bank s construction and land development portfolio and the effect of various factors such as geographic and loan type concentrations 
the bank also reviewed the national and regional trends of declining home sales with potential housing market value depreciation 
the allowance for loan losses increased by million to million at september  from million at september  the increased level of the allowance for loan losses was primarily attributable to an increase in impaired loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s grading system  and uncertainties in the housing market and economy 
based on the comprehensive methodology  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and of non performing loans adequate to provide for probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date 
while the bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan portfolio  will not request the bank to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information  see item  business lending activities allowance for loan losses 
non interest income total non interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily a result of a million decrease in loss on the redemption of mutual funds  million increase in gain on sale of loans  an  increase in service charges on deposit accounts  a  increase in boli net earnings and  in income recorded for property easements sold 
these increases to non interest income were partially offset by a million increase in net otti losses recorded during the year ended september  the million loss on mutual funds recorded during the year ended september  was a result of the redemption of investments in the amf family of mutual funds for the underlying securities and cash 
the net otti charges of million recorded during the year ended september  were on private label mortgage backed securities that were acquired from the in kind redemption from the amf family of mutual funds in the increased income from loan sales was primarily a result of an increase in the dollar amount of residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market for the year ended september  the sale of one to four family mortgage loans totaled million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in loan sales was primarily attributable to lower interest rates for year fixed rate loans which increased refinancing activity 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily a result of implementing a new automated overdraft decision system in may and increasing the fee charged for overdrafts 
the increase in boli income was attributable to a  death claim benefit and a  gain from moving a number of the bank s boli policies to a new insurance carrier 
non interest expense total non interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in fdic insurance expense including a special fdic assessment of  a  increase in oreo related expenses  a  increase in loan monitoring and foreclosure related expenses which are included in the other non interest expense category  a  increase in premises and equipment expense  a  increase in salary and benefit expenses  and a  increase in deposit related expenses which are included in the other non interest expense category 
the increase in oreo related expenses and foreclosure expenses were primarily a result of an increase in the number of oreo properties held and an increase in foreclosure activity 
the increase in premises and equipment expenses was partially attributable to the addition of a full service branch facility in chehalis  washington 
also contributing to the change in premises and equipment expense was an insurance settlement and the sale of a building in the prior fiscal year which reduced premises and equipments expenses by a combined  for the year ended september  the bank also recorded a capital gain on the sale of bank owned property in the current fiscal year which reduced premises and equipment expenses by  for the year ended september  the increased salary and benefit expenses were primarily a result of annual salary adjustments and increased insurance expenses 
the increased deposit related expenses were primarily a result of the expenses associated with several new deposit related programs 
the company s efficiency ratio increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  provision benefit for federal income taxes the provision for federal income taxes decreased by million to a net benefit of  for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of lower income before taxes 
the benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended september  was impacted by an increased level of non taxable income  primarily attributable to the increase in boli net earnings 
the income tax benefit for the year ended september  was also increased by approximately  due to adjustments made to the company s deferred tax valuation allowance for a previous non deductible capital loss carry forward 
the provision for federal income taxes for the year ended september  was impacted by the million loss on the redemption of mutual funds 
the redemption of the mutual funds resulted in a capital loss which can only be deducted for tax purposes to the extent that capital gains are realized within a three year carry back period and a five year carry forward period 
the company estimated that it would have  in capital gains during the allowable tax period to offset the capital loss 
therefore million of the million loss was treated as non deductible for tax purposes for the year ended september  the company s effective tax rate was or exclusive of the mutual fund redemption loss and associated tax impact for the year ended september  comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and the company s net income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily as a result of increased provision for loan losses  decreased non interest income due to a loss on the redemption of mutual funds  and increased non interest expenses  which were partially offset by increased net interest income 
diluted earnings per common share decreased by to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increased provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an increase in the level of non performing loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s loan grading system  loan portfolio growth  and uncertainties in the housing market in certain markets of the pacific northwest 
net charge offs were  during the year ended september   which was equivalent to of the average outstanding loans 
the decreased non interest income was primarily a result of a million loss on the sale of securities  as the company redeemed its investment in the amf family of mutual funds in june this loss was partially offset by increased income from service charges on deposit accounts and increased income from loan sales 
the increased non interest expense was primarily a result of increased employee costs and increased deposit related expenses 
the increased salary and employee benefit expenses were primarily a result of annual salary adjustments and increased insurance expenses 
the increased deposit related expenses were primarily a result of the expenses associated with several new deposit related programs implemented during the year 
the increased net interest income was primarily a result of a larger interest earning asset base due to an increased loan portfolio 
the increase in net interest income attributable to a larger interest earning asset base was  however  partially offset by a decrease in the company s net interest margin 
a more detailed explanation of the income statement categories is presented below 
net income net income for the year ended september  decreased by million  or  to million  or per diluted common share per basic common share from million  or per diluted common share per basic common share for the year ended september  the decrease in diluted earnings per common share for the year ended september  was primarily the result of a million million net of income tax per diluted common share charge from the redemption of the company s investment in the amf family of mutual funds  a million million net of income tax per diluted common share increase in the provision for loan losses  and a   net of income tax per diluted common share increase in non interest expense 
these items were partially offset by a   net of income tax per diluted common share increase in net interest income  a million  net of income tax per diluted common share increase in non interest income  excluding the mutual fund redemption charge  and a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding which increased diluted earnings per common share by approximately 
net interest income net interest income increased by  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a larger interest earning asset base due to an increased loan portfolio 
total interest and dividend income increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as average total interest earning assets increased by million 
the yield on interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  total interest expense increased by  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as average interest bearing liabilities increased by million 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the increase in net interest income attributable to a larger interest earning asset base was  however  partially offset by a compression of the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  as the yield on interest earnings assets decreased at a greater rate than funding costs were decreased 
this was primarily a result of the decreasing interest rate environment which reduced yields on loans at a faster pace than the bank was able to reduce deposit and borrowing costs 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the increased provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an increase in non performing loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s loan grading system  loan portfolio growth  and uncertainties in the housing market in certain markets of the pacific northwest 
the bank had a net charge off of  for the year ended september  compared to a net charge off of  for the year ended september  the net charge offs to average outstanding loans ratio was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  the bank has established a comprehensive methodology for determining the provision for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the bank performs an analysis taking into consideration pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  a detailed analysis of individual loans on non accrual status  and other factors to determine the level of allowance for loan losses needed 
management s analysis  however  for the year ended september   placed a greater emphasis on the bank s construction and land development portfolio and the effect of various factors such as geographic and loan type concentrations 
the bank also reviewed the national trend of declining home sales with potential housing market value depreciation 
the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at september  from million at september  the increased level of the allowance for loan losses was primarily attributable to an increase in non performing loans  an increase in the level of performing loans classified as substandard under the bank s grading system  loan portfolio growth  and uncertainties in the housing market and economy 
based on the comprehensive methodology  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and of non performing loans adequate to provide for probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date 
while the bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan portfolio  will not request the bank to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information  see item business lending activities allowance for loan losses 
non interest income total non interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a million loss on the redemption of investments in the amf family of mutual funds 
non interest income  excluding the mutual fund redemption loss increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million from the year ended september  this increase was primarily a result of a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a  increase in gain on sale of loans 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily a result of implementing a new automated overdraft decision system during the year and increasing the fee charged for overdrafts 
the increase in income from loan sales was primarily a result of an increase in the dollar value of fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans sold during the year 
the sale of fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans totaled million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  non interest expense total non interest expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in salary and benefit expenses and a  increase in deposit related expenses 
salary and benefit expenses increased primarily as a result of annual salary adjustments and increased health insurance expenses 
deposit related expenses increased primarily as a result of the expenses associated with several new deposit related programs implemented during the year and an increase in fdic insurance expense recorded as the bank s credit with the fdic was fully depleted during the quarter ended june  the company s efficiency ratio increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the efficiency ratio  excluding the mutual fund redemption loss  was for the year ended september  provision for federal income taxes the provision for federal income taxes decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of lower income before taxes 
the provision for federal income taxes for the year ended september  was also impacted by the million loss on the redemption of mutual funds 
the redemption of the mutual funds resulted in a capital loss which can only be deducted for tax purposes to the extent that capital gains are realized within a three year carry back period and a five year carry forward period 
the company has estimated that it will have  in capital gains during the allowable tax period to offset the capital loss 
therefore million of the million loss has been treated as non deductible for tax purposes 
the company s effective tax rate was or exclusive of the mutual fund redemption loss and associated tax impact for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  average balances  interest and average yields cost the earnings of the company depend largely on the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as the relative amount of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liability portfolios

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are customer deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  the sale of loans  maturing securities and fhlb advances 
while the maturity and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy other financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at september   the bank s regulatory liquidity ratio net cash  and short term and marketable assets  as a percentage of net deposits and short term liabilities was

liquidity management is both a short and long term responsibility of the bank s management 
the bank adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of i expected loan demand  ii projected loan sales  iii expected deposit flows  and iv yields available on interest bearing deposits 
excess liquidity is invested generally in interest bearing overnight deposits and other short term government and agency obligations 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb  pcbb and collateral for repurchase agreements

the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
