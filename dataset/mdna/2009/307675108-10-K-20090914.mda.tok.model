the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include pro forma historical information  as if the results of the dsd coffee business had been included from the beginning of the periods presented  since the use of forward looking information would be necessary in order to meaningfully present the effects of the acquisition 
forward looking information  rather than historical information  would be required since the dsd coffee business was operated as part of a larger business within sara lee and there will be a different operating cost structure and different operations support under the company s ownership 
net revenue of the dsd coffee business for the eight months ended february  the effective date of the acquisition was approximately million  and approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  however the company has not provided forward looking information with respect to incremental costs and expenses to be incurred because such information is not determinable 
the acquisition has been accounted for as an asset purchase 
the total purchase price has been allocated to tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of february  as determined by management based upon a third party valuation 
the purchase price allocation has not been finalized  since it is possible that certain adjustments may be made if additional facts or circumstances become known that impact the estimates 
revisions to the allocation  which may be significant  will be reported as changes to various assets and liabilities 
certain costs related to the integration of the dsd coffee business with our existing business  including the costs of exiting certain acquired operations  have been capitalized as purchase related costs and allocated to the acquired assets
