our four business segments are top drives  tubular services  casing drilling and research and engineering 
historically  we organized our activities into three business segments top drives  casing services and research and engineering 
effective december   we separated our tubular services activities from our casing drilling business and our financial and operating data for the years ended december  through has been recast in this annual report on form k to be presented consistently with this structure 
the top drive business is comprised of top drive sales  top drive rentals and after market sales and service 
the tubular services business includes both our proprietary and conventional tubular services 
the casing drilling segment consists of our proprietary casing drilling technology  and the research and engineering segment is comprised of our research and development activities related to our proprietary tubular services and casing drilling technology and top drive model development 
for a detailed description of these business segments  see part i  item business  above 
business environment strong oil and gas drilling activity and a spike in oil and gas prices in mid continued to provide significant opportunities for us to expand our customer base 
however  during the latter portion of the year  a global economic crisis hit the financial and credit markets which led to a significant global economic slowdown 
current conditions point to continued slow economic activity through with wide ranging volatility in oil and gas prices 
one of the key indicators of our business is the number of active drilling rigs and this number has varied widely in recent months 
the average annual number of active drilling rigs excluding rigs drilling in russia or onshore china for which reliable estimates are not available is as follows years ended december  united states canada latin america including mexico europe  africa and middle east asia pacific worldwide average source baker hughes rig count during  north american average rig activity increased slightly with a spike in the summer months  but fell off sharply in december 
we believe that will be a year in which drilling activity in the united states and canada will decline sharply from levels  but that drilling activity in other areas of the world will sustain better than in the us 
table of contents 
index to financial statements according to world oil  drilling activity for the last three years has been and the forecast for is as follows for the years ended december  forecast wells drilled us canada latin america europe  n 
africa  middle east far east worldwide forecast released by world oil on january  we believe that will be a year of uncertainty 
the current outlook for the global economy varies daily  but generally points toward a sharp decline in the first half of in particular  the us and canadian rig activity is projected to decline from levels 
international demand is expected to sustain better than us demand  but this is contingent on increased commodity pricing 
we are committed to expanding our role as a leading service provider to the global drilling industry 
all of our services and products are delivered through geographic business units to provide customers with a single point of contact for all of our products and services 
outlook current global macro economic conditions make any projections difficult and uncertain 
however  we believe top drive backlog is a leading indicator of how our business will be affected by changes in the global macro economic environment 
we experienced a strong order rate in and ended the year with a backlog of top drive units  with a total value of million  compared to a backlog of units at december   with a total value of million 
based upon the most recent changes in the economy  we expect a slower order rate in over the last three years  our average revenue per top drive unit sale has increased due to a shift in market demand to larger  more complex units 
however  we have recently seen an increase in the demand for smaller top drive units typically required for fast moving new build rigs 
we believe that for our top drive business  a backlog of two quarters of production is reasonable and allows us to effectively manage our supply chain and workforce  yet be responsive to our client base 
additionally  the mix of top drive unit sales may be changing 
we expect international demand for our rental top drives to sustain better than us demand 
thus  we may shift the location of several fleet units during to meet market demand 
we will re route our units in a manner that minimizes disruptions to our rental operations 
in addition  our increased manufacturing capacity since mid currently to top drive units per month  depending on system complexity and top drive sales over the past several years expanded our installed base throughout the world  providing increased market stability and expansion opportunities for our after market sales and service business 
accordingly  we expect continuing demand for our top drive after market sales and services business  although a temporary decline for these services may occur as a result of the economic slowdown and the related decline in operating worldwide rig count 
over the long term we believe that our top drive business needs to maintain manufacturing inventory of two quarters of production to limit our exposure to fluctuations in sales markets and to allow effective management 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of our supply chain and workforce 
in addition  we must maintain additional inventory of long lead time items and semi finished goods to support our after market sales and service business and our manufacturing operations 
in we initiated a sales and operational planning program to balance market demand with inventory and our ability to supply top drives 
in mid  we initiated a global distribution center gdc in order to more closely monitor our global parts inventory and to provide our operating locations with a centralized purchasing center 
we believe the gdc will improve our purchasing power with suppliers and allow us to provide inventory parts to our customers around the world in a more expedient manner 
we continue to develop relationships with new and existing customers in both our tubular services and casing drilling segments 
for tubular services  we expect our cds proprietary casing business and mclrs activities to remain flat or decrease slightly in compared to and our conventional activity to decline compared to as we continue to focus our efforts on the expansion of our proprietary service offerings 
we continue to address the high cost structure of our north american tubular services business by optimizing personnel and assets in operating areas that provide the highest returns and by identifying low performing areas 
in addition  we continue to expand our tubular services activities in selected international locations to help increase our global footprint and to mitigate the us economic downturn 
with respect to our casing drilling business  we plan to continue our investment and believe that its performance should improve in compared to during and  we incurred substantial expenses to build our business infrastructure and expand our resource base globally in order to grow casing drilling at a faster rate 
we expect that these investments will yield growth in our casing drilling revenues over the next several years 
as described in overview business conditions  our international business as a percentage of revenue and operating income has increased over the past two years 
we intend to continue our focus on international opportunities  especially with the anticipated decline in drilling activity in the united states and canada during the foregoing are forward looking statements and are subject to the cautionary statements in forward looking information and risk factors at the beginning of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements results of operations years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily due to a million increase in the top drive segment  a million increase in casing drilling revenues and a million increase in the tubular services segment 
operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased operating income in the top drive and in the tubular services segments  decreased losses from our casing drilling segment and decreased costs in our research and engineering segment  partially offset by increased corporate and other expenses 
results for each business segment are discussed in further detail below 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million in  or per diluted share  an increase of million 
this increase primarily results from increased operating income discussed above and a million change in foreign currency gains losses from a loss of million in to a gain of million in due to the strengthening of the us dollar during  partially offset by a million decrease in interest income due to interest received on a mexican tax deposit during revenue and operating income by segment and net income for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands years ended december  change of revenues of revenues revenues top drive sales after market support rental operations total top drive tubular services conventional proprietary total tubular services casing drilling total revenues operating income top drive tubular services casing drilling research and engineering  n a  n a corporate and other  n a  n a total operating income net income at the end of  we commenced the presentation of our tubular services business and casing drilling as two separate segments 
accordingly  we have reclassified prior year revenues of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements approximately million and prior year operating losses of approximately million from the former casing services segment to the casing drilling segment to conform to current year presentation 
at the end of  we commenced the presentation of tubular services revenue according to two categories conventional and proprietary 
prior to january   mclrs and certain part sales and services were included with conventional services 
however  since these activities use proprietary and patented technology  we now include them with our proprietary information 
accordingly  we have reclassified prior year revenues of approximately million related to these sales from conventional to proprietary to conform to our current year presentation 
we incur costs directly and indirectly associated with our revenues at a business unit level 
direct costs include expenditures specifically incurred for the generation of revenue  such as personnel costs on location or transportation  maintenance and repair  and depreciation of our revenue generating equipment 
overhead costs  such as field administration and field operations support  are not directly associated with the generation of revenue within a particular business segment 
in prior years  we allocated total overhead costs at a consolidated level based on a percentage of global revenues 
during the current year  we were able to identify and capture  where appropriate  the specific operating segments in which we incurred overhead costs at the business unit level 
using this information  we have reclassified our prior year segment operating results to conform to the current year presentation 
these reclassifications resulted in an increase of million in operating income in the top drive segment and a corresponding decrease of million in the tubular services segment for year ended december  top drive segment our top drive segment is comprised of top drive sales  after market sales and support and top drive rental activities 
revenues revenue for the year ended december  increased million compared to  primarily driven by a million increase in top drive sales  a million increase in top drive after market support and a million increase in top drive rental operations 
revenues from top drive sales increased million  or  to million as compared to  primarily the result of the sale of units in compared to units during during  we sold top drive units  of which were new units and were used units 
during  we sold top drive units  of which were new units and were used units 
the selling price per unit varies significantly depending on the model  whether the unit was previously operated in our rental fleet and whether a power unit was included in the sale 
when top drive units in our rental fleet are sold  the sales proceeds are included in revenues and the net book value of the equipment sold is included in cost of sales and services 
revenues related to the sale of used units sold in and were million and million  respectively 
in addition to selling top drive units  we provide after market sales and service to support our installed base 
revenues from top drive after market support increased million  or  to million as compared to  primarily due to the increase in our third party installed base and our efforts to expand this service 

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenues from top drive rental activities increased million  or  to million as compared to  primarily due to an increase in the number of operating days  slightly offset by a decline in standby revenues 
the increase in rental days was due to the increased size and utilization rates for our rental fleet  but offset by downtime associated with used units being removed from operations to be prepared for sale 
we sold used units from our rental fleet in  and added units 
we also experienced downtime between when the new units were manufactured and when the new units were mobilized for operations 
the number of top drive operating days and average daily operating rates for and and the number of rental units in our fleet at year end and were in thousands years ended december  number of operating days average daily operating rates number of units in rental fleet  end of year we define an operating day as a day that a unit in our rental fleet is under contract and operating 
we do not include stand by days in our definition of an operating day 
a stand by day is a day in which we are paid an amount  which may be less than the full contract rate  to have a top drive rental unit available to a customer but that unit is not operating 
in  stand by revenues from rental operations decreased million to million due to increased operating demand for our top drive rental units 
operating income top drive operating income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to this increase was primarily driven by the increase in the number of top drive units sold in compared to units in compared to units in  higher sales margins on our used top drive sales and growth in our high margin aftermarket sales and services 
partially offsetting this increase in were lower margins in our rental business due to costs related to revitalizing our fleet in north america  start up costs related to new contracts in certain international markets  particularly mexico  and increased maintenance  refurbishment and recertification costs due to the high utilization of our rental fleet 
tubular services segment revenues revenues for the year ended december  increased million to million as compared to the increase in revenue reflects an increase of approximately million  or  in proprietary revenues  offset by a million  or  decrease in conventional casing running revenues as we shift our focus to gaining market share and market acceptance of our proprietary product offerings 
tubular services proprietary revenue is principally generated from our casing and tubing business utilizing our proprietary casing running technology and the sale of our cds units and related equipment 
additionally  our proprietary tubular service business includes the installation service of deep water smart well completion equipment using our mclrs  a proprietary and patented technology which improves the quality of the installation of high end well completions 
prior to january   mclrs and certain part sales and services were included with conventional services 
since mclrs is a proprietary and patented technology  we now include this and related activity with our proprietary information 
accordingly  we have reclassified prior year revenues related to mclrs from conventional to proprietary 
our proprietary tubular services business generated revenue of million in  an increase of million  or  from  which is primarily due to our proprietary job activity as our job count increased from  in to  in the proprietary job count increase is a reflection of our increased utilization of our cds tools 
in addition  our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements proprietary casing drive system fleet which increased from units at december  to units at december  our revenues related to the sale of cds and related equipment decreased by approximately million from mclrs revenues also decreased million to million in compared to as we focused our services on international opportunities 
our conventional tubular service business provides equipment and personnel for the installation of tubing and casing  including power tongs  pick up lay down units  torque monitoring services  connection testing services and power swivels for new well construction and in work over and re entry operations 
our conventional tubular services business generated revenue of million in  a decrease of million from  primarily due to our shift in job focus from conventional to proprietary services 
during  we continued to gain market acceptance of our services that use our proprietary and patented technology 
operating income tubular services operating income for the year ended december  decreased million to million compared to the decrease was primarily driven by increased depreciation expenses and fuel prices 
our operating income was also affected by costs associated with closing some non producing districts and the start up costs of international projects 
as the industry moves toward mechanized drilling technology  we expect the market for our conventional service offerings will be replaced by demand for our proprietary offerings 
casing drilling segment revenues revenues for were million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the revenue increase in was attributable to significant international revenue growth in both latin america and the middle east as well as continued revenue growth in north america 
operating income casing drilling s operating loss for the year ended december  decreased million to million compared to million in operating margins improved from a loss of in to a loss of in  primarily due to increased revenues earned 
we continue to establish the infrastructure needed to supply our casing drilling services in locations around the world 
as we continue to build a global market for this business and gain critical mass  we expect to realize improved margins 
research and engineering segment research and engineering s operating expenses are comprised of our activities related to the design and enhancement of our top drive models and proprietary equipment and were million for  a decrease of million from s operating expenses of million 
this decrease is primarily due to normalization of expenditures from  when we focused on development and market production of a new generation of hydraulic and electric top drives 
we continue to invest in the commercialization and enhancements of our proprietary technologies 
corporate and other corporate and other is primarily comprised of the corporate level general and administrative expenses and corporate level selling and marketing expenses 
corporate and other s operating loss for the year ended december  increased million to a million loss compared to this increase is primarily due to a million in legal expenses due to the status of our ongoing legal cases  and a million increase in salaries and incentive compensation based on the company s improved financial performance  partially offset by decreased computer expenses
