item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those under the heading risk factors beginning on page we do not assume  and specifically disclaim  any obligation to update any forward looking statement contained in this report 
overview the primary source of our operating revenue is truckload revenue  which we generate by transporting long haul and regional freight for our customers and report within our truckload segment 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
we also derive truckload revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention and other ancillary services 
the main factors that affect our truckload revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
we monitor our revenue production primarily through average truckload revenue  net of fuel surcharges  per tractor per week 
we also analyze our average truckload revenue  net of fuel surcharges  per total mile  non revenue miles percentage  the miles per tractor we generate  our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue 
our operating revenue also includes revenue reported within our logistics segment  which consists of revenue from our internal brokerage and intermodal operations  both launched in  and through our interest in mwl  a third party provider of logistics services to the transportation industry 
brokerage services involve arranging for another company to transport freight for our customers while we retain the billing  collection and customer management responsibilities 
intermodal services involve the transport of our trailers on railroad flatcars for a portion of a trip  with the balance of the trip using our tractors or  to a lesser extent  contracted carriers 
the main factors that affect our logistics revenue are the rate per mile and other charges we receive from our customers and the rates charged by third party providers 
in addition to the factors discussed above  our operating revenue is also affected by  among other things  the united states economy  inventory levels  the level of truck and rail capacity in the transportation market and specific customer demand 
in  we increased our operating revenue by million  or 
our operating revenue  net of fuel surcharges  increased million  or  compared with fuel surcharges increased million  or  in due to the significant increase in the average cost of fuel from truckload segment revenue  net of fuel surcharges  decreased due to a decrease in our weighted average number of tractors  partially offset by a increase in average truckload revenue  net of fuel surcharges  per total mile 
the increase in average truckload revenue  net of fuel surcharges  per total mile was the result of an improved freight mix and a reduced average length of haul 
our average truckload revenue  net of fuel surcharges  per tractor per week increased in primarily due to the increase in revenue per total mile  partially offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor 
the changes in our operating statistics are consistent with the growth of our regional temperature controlled operations in by focusing on shorter lengths of haul in certain defined areas  we are addressing customer trends toward regional distribution to lower their transportation expense  furthering our own objectives of reducing fuel consumption per load  and matching some of our drivers desires to stay closer to home 
the concentration of a portion of our fleet in these markets is evident in a reduction from in average length of haul to miles 
in response to a challenging freight environment with industry wide capacity exceeding freight demand  we decreased our fleet throughout as a result  our average fleet size was tractors less in than in the increase in our operating revenue  net of fuel surcharges  was driven by continued volume growth in each of 
table of contents our internal brokerage and intermodal services and in the logistics services provided by mwl  partially offset by the decrease in truckload revenue  net of fuel surcharges 
logistics revenue  which represented of our operating revenue in  increased million  or  compared with our profitability on the expense side is impacted by variable costs of transporting freight for our customers  fixed costs and expenses containing both fixed and variable components 
the variable costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded under purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency and other factors 
our main fixed costs relate to the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and operating terminals 
we expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment 
although certain factors affecting our expenses are beyond our control  we monitor them closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business 
for example  fuel prices fluctuated dramatically at various times during the last several years  with the doe national average cost of fuel increasing to per gallon in from per gallon in we manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers  as well as through volume fuel purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals 
to help further reduce fuel expense  we began installing auxiliary power units in our tractors in to provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine 
for our logistics segment  our profitability on the expense side is impacted by the percentage of logistics revenue we pay to providers for the transportation services we arrange 
our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  or operating ratio  was in compared with in our earnings per diluted share increased to in from in our business requires substantial  ongoing capital investments  particularly for new tractors and trailers 
at december   we had approximately million of long term debt  including current maturities  and million in stockholders equity 
in  we spent million to purchase new revenue equipment  net of proceeds from dispositions 
these expenditures were funded with cash flows from operations 
we estimate that capital expenditures  net of proceeds from dispositions  will be approximately million to million in  which we will adjust throughout the year as we size our fleet to existing customer demand 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months 
based upon anticipated cash flows  current borrowing availability and sources of financing we expect to be available to us  we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussions of truckload and logistics revenue  net of fuel surcharges  and net fuel expense fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors  outside drayage carriers and railroads 
we provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period 
these financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap

table of contents salaries  wages and benefits consist of compensation for our employees  including both driver and non driver employees  employees health insurance  k plan contributions and other fringe benefits 
these expenses vary depending upon the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors  our efficiency  our experience with employees health insurance claims  changes in health care premiums and other factors 
the decrease in salaries  wages and benefits resulted primarily from a decrease in the total miles driven by company drivers and the adoption in the first quarter of of a per diem expense reimbursement program for our drivers  which was partially offset by a million increase in our self insured medical claims  which increased our employees health insurance expense  and a million increase in bonus compensation expensed for our non driver employees 
purchased transportation consists of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment and to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities 
this category will vary depending upon the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors  the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors and the amount and rates we pay to third party railroad and motor carriers 
purchased transportation expense increased million in total  or  in from payments to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our brokerage and intermodal operations increased million to million in from million in  as our logistics operations significantly increased in size and scope 
the portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors  including fuel surcharges  decreased million in  primarily due to a decrease in the number of independent contractor owned tractors in our fleet 
we expect that purchased transportation expense will continue to increase as we grow our logistics segment  but this increase will be partially offset by an expected continuing decline in the number of independent contractor owned tractors in our fleet due to difficult operating conditions 
net fuel expense fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors  outside drayage carriers and railroads decreased million  or  to million in from million in fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors  outside drayage carriers and railroads were million in and million in over the past year  we have worked diligently to control fuel costs and usage by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers fuel purchases with national fuel centers  focusing on shorter lengths of haul  installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in our trailers refrigeration units 
the decrease in net fuel expense was primarily due to a decrease in the total miles driven by our company owned fleet and to the cost control measures stated above  principally the use of auxiliary power units 
auxiliary power units  which were installed in of our company owned tractors as of december   provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine 
the impact of decreased miles and the cost control measures were partially offset by a significant increase in the doe national average cost of fuel during to per gallon from per gallon in net fuel expense represented of truckload and intermodal revenue  net of fuel surcharges  in  compared with in depreciation relates to owned tractors  trailers  auxiliary power units  communications units  terminal facilities and other assets 
the increase in depreciation was due to our investment in auxiliary power units since mid and to an increase in the relative percentage of company owned tractors to independent contractor owned tractors in we expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment  which is expected to result in greater depreciation over the useful life 
insurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts  primarily for personal injury  property damage  physical damage to our equipment  cargo claims and workers compensation claims 
these expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience  our self insured retention levels and the market for insurance 
the increase in insurance and claims in was primarily the result of an increase in the cost of self insured auto liability and workers compensation accident claims 
we are responsible for the first 
table of contents million on each auto liability claim and also responsible for up to million in the aggregate for of all auto liability claim amounts in excess of million 
we are responsible for the first  on each workers compensation claim 
our significant self insured retention exposes us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods depending on the frequency  severity and timing of claims and to adverse financial results if we incur large or numerous losses 
in the event of an uninsured claim above our insurance coverage  or an increase in the frequency or severity of claims within our self insured retention  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a decrease in the market value for used revenue equipment  which we believe was driven by capacity reductions in the industry  caused our gain on disposition of revenue equipment to decrease to million in from million in  despite an increase in the number of tractors sold 
future gains or losses on disposition of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment  which is beyond our control 
we do not expect our gain on disposition to improve in the near future as we believe that there are few buyers with adequate financing in comparison with available inventory  and the expectation of additional trucking company failures is likely to keep used truck inventories high 
as a result of the foregoing factors  our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  or operating ratio  was in compared with in interest expense primarily consists of interest on our unsecured committed credit facility and senior unsecured notes 
the decrease in interest expense of million  or  in from was primarily the result of lower average debt balances outstanding 
our effective income tax rate increased to in from in  primarily because of the nondeductible effect of a per diem pay structure for our drivers adopted in the first quarter of as a result of the factors described above  net income increased to million in from million in net earnings increased to per diluted share in from per diluted share in

the increase in supplies and maintenance in primarily resulted from the higher percentage of company owned tractors in our fleet  for which we bear all maintenance expenses  an increase in the size of our trailer fleet associated with growth of our intermodal operations and an increase in the average age of our tractor and trailer fleets 
our maintenance practices in were consistent with the increase in depreciation was due to an increase in revenue equipment and in the relative percentage of company owned tractors to independent contractor owned tractors in the increase in insurance and claims in was primarily the result of an increase in physical damage claims with respect to our tractors and trailers 
a decrease in the planned number of revenue equipment dispositions and a decrease in the market value for used revenue equipment caused our gain on disposition of revenue equipment to decrease to million in from million in as a result of the foregoing factors  our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  or operating ratio  was in compared with in our effective income tax rate increased to in from in  primarily because we decreased our deferred income tax liability in by of income before income taxes 
this decrease was primarily due to a change in income apportionment for several states  which produced a lower effective state income tax rate  net of federal impact 
as a result of the factors described above  net income decreased to million in from million in net earnings per share decreased to per diluted share in from per diluted share in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our business requires substantial  ongoing capital investments  particularly for new tractors and trailers 
our primary sources of liquidity are funds provided by operations  our unsecured senior notes and our revolving credit facility 
a portion of our tractor fleet is provided by independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment 
we have no capital expenditure requirements relating to those drivers who own their tractors or obtain financing through third parties 
however  to the extent we purchase tractors and extend financing to the independent contractors through our tractor purchase program  we have an associated capital expenditure requirement 
the table below reflects our net cash flows provided by operating activities  net cash flows used for investing activities  net cash flows used for provided by financing activities and total long term debt  including current maturities  for the years indicated 
in thousands net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used for investing activities net cash flows used for provided by financing activities long term debt  including current maturities  at december in december  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock either through purchases on the open market or through private transactions 
the timing and extent to which we will repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations 
in the first quarter of we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock for  we made no purchases in or in the remainder of the repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
in  we spent million to purchase new revenue equipment  net of proceeds from dispositions 
these expenditures were funded with cash flows from operations 
we estimate that capital expenditures  net of proceeds from dispositions  will be approximately million to million in  which we will adjust throughout the year as we size our fleet to existing customer demand 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months 
based upon anticipated cash flows  current borrowing availability and sources of financing we expect to be available to us  we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
we have outstanding senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal balance of million at december  these notes mature in april  require annual principal payments of million and bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 
we maintain a credit agreement that provides for a five year unsecured committed credit facility maturing in september in an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
the aggregate principal amount of the credit facility may be increased at our option up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of million 
at december   there was no outstanding principal balance on the credit facility 
as of that date  we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and remaining borrowing availability of million 
this facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate or the agent bank s prime rate  in each case plus minus applicable margins 
our credit facility prohibits us from paying  in any fiscal year  dividends in excess of of our net income from the prior fiscal year 
the debt agreements discussed above also contain restrictive covenants 
table of contents which  among other matters  require us to maintain certain financial ratios  including debt to equity  cash flow leverage  interest coverage and fixed charge coverage 
we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december  we had  in direct financing receivables from independent contractors under our tractor purchase program as of december   compared with million in receivables as of december  these receivables  which are collateralized by the financed tractors  are used to attract and retain qualified independent contractors 
we deduct payments from the independent contractors settlements weekly and  as a result  have experienced minimal collection issues for these receivables 
the decrease in the receivables balance is related to an initiative to direct the leases to a third party leasing vendor in the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period and in thousands thereafter total purchase obligations for revenue equipment long term debt obligations building construction obligations operating lease obligations total related parties we purchase fuel and obtain tires and related services from bauer built  inc  or bbi

we paid bbi million in  million in and million in for fuel and tire services 
in addition  we paid million in  million in and million in to tire manufacturers for tires that we purchased from the tire manufacturers but were provided by bbi 
bbi received commissions from the tire manufacturers related to these purchases

in august  we acquired a building adjacent to our headquarters which will be used for maintenance and storage from randolph l 
marten  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  in a like kind exchange for a building of equal value owned by marten transport 
each of the buildings were valued at  at the time of the exchange 
off balance sheet arrangements other than standby letters of credit maintained in connection with our self insurance programs in the amount of million and operating leases summarized above in our summary of contractual obligations  we did not have any other material off balance sheet arrangements at december  
table of contents inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  accident claims  health insurance and employee compensation 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability 
we require substantial amounts of fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature control units on our trailers 
substantially all of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although we historically have been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  such increases usually are not fully recovered 
fuel prices were high throughout the past three years  which has increased our cost of operating 
seasonality our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with harsh weather creating higher accident frequency  increased claims and more equipment repairs 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions  and such differences could be material 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue  including fuel surcharges  at the time shipment of freight is completed 
accounts receivable 
we are dependent upon a limited number of customers  and as a result  our trade accounts receivable are highly concentrated 
trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances  including any billing disputes 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best information available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
we evaluate the allowance based on historical write off experience  the size of the individual customer balances  past due amounts and the overall national economy 
we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
property and equipment 
the transportation industry requires significant capital investments 
our net property and equipment was million as of december  and million as of december  our depreciation expense was million for  million for and million for we compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset  reduced by its estimated salvage value  using the straight line method over its estimated 
table of contents useful life 
we determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment  prior useful lives and changes in technology 
we have not changed our policy regarding salvage values as a percentage of initial cost or useful lives of tractors and trailers within the last ten years 
we believe that our policies and past estimates have been reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a decrease in estimated salvage values would have decreased our net property and equipment as of december  by approximately million  or 
in  we replaced most of our company owned tractors within approximately years and our trailers within approximately years after purchase 
our useful lives for depreciating tractors is five years and trailers is seven years  with a salvage value for tractors and a salvage value for trailers 
these salvage values are based upon the expected market values of the equipment after five years for tractors and seven years for trailers 
depreciation expense calculated in this manner approximates the continuing declining value of the revenue equipment  and continues at a consistent straight line rate for units held beyond the normal replacement cycle 
calculating tractor depreciation expense with a five year useful life and a salvage value results in the same depreciation rate of of cost per year and the same net book value of of cost at the year replacement date as using a year useful life and salvage value 
as a result  there is no difference in recorded depreciation expense on a quarterly or annual basis with our five year useful life and salvage value compared with a year useful life and salvage value 
similarly  calculating trailer depreciation expense with seven year useful life and a salvage value results in the same depreciation rate of of cost per year and the same net book value of of cost at the year replacement date as using a year useful life and salvage value 
as a result  there is no difference in recorded depreciation expense on a quarterly or annual basis with our seven year useful life and salvage value compared with a year useful life and salvage value 
impairment of assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
insurance and claims 
we self insure  in part  for losses relating to workers compensation  auto liability  general liability  cargo and property damage claims  along with employees health insurance with varying risk retention levels 
we maintain insurance coverage for per incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review 
however  we could suffer a series of losses within our self insured retention limits or losses over our policy limits  which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 
we are responsible for the first million on each auto liability claim and also responsible for up to million in the aggregate for of all auto liability claim amounts in excess of million 
we are responsible for the first  on each workers compensation claim 
we have million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities 
the insurance and claims accruals in our consolidated balance sheets were million as of december   and million as of december  we reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
we periodically evaluate and adjust these reserves based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and our estimate of future claims development based on historical claims development factors 
we believe that our claims development factors have historically been reasonable  as indicated by the adequacy of our insurance and claims accruals compared to settled claims 
actual results could differ from these current estimates 
in addition  to the extent that claims are litigated and not settled  jury awards are difficult to predict 
if our claims settlement experience worsened causing our historical claims development factors to increase by  our estimated outstanding loss reserves as of december  would have needed to increase by approximately million 

table of contents share based payment arrangement compensation 
we have granted stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment arrangements granted after december  and prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we record share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only record compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for service based awards normally the vesting period 
compensation expense will be recorded for performance based awards in the periods in which the performance condition is probable of achievement 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment arrangements require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment arrangements and stock price volatility 
we use the black scholes model to value our stock option awards 
we believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility 
thus  we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period

 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the statement provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas is effective for financial statements 
however  sfas as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for non financial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis is effective for the adoption of sfas did not and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

sfas 
sfas requires that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations  but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary 
this statement is effective for the first quarter of we continue to evaluate the impact of this new pronouncement  but currently believe the only impact of adopting sfas would be to reclassify million in minority interest to a separate component of stockholders equity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel 
our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political  economic and market factors that are beyond our control 
significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to recover a portion of diesel fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we presently use fuel surcharges to address the risk of high fuel prices 
fuel surcharge programs are widely accepted among our customers  though they can vary somewhat from customer to customer 
we believe fuel surcharges are effective at mitigating the risk of high fuel prices  although we do not recover the full amount of fuel price increases 
while we do not currently have any outstanding hedging instruments to mitigate this market risk  we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge a portion of our fuel costs in the future
