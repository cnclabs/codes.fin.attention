item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates of this report 
we tested our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of as a result of the testing  we recorded impairment losses of million related to the goodwill recorded in our wilmington  de  las vegas  nv and augusta  ga market clusters 
the impairment losses were primarily due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates in these markets 
advertising revenue declined moderately during the first three quarters then significantly during the fourth quarter of  which determined the timing of the impairment test 
for further discussion  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates of this report 
we continue to be impacted by deteriorating general economic conditions  which have caused a downturn in the advertising industry 
the decreased demand for advertising has negatively impacted our revenues 
we expect the current environment to continue for some time and for our revenues to be adversely impacted during that time 
we will continue to review our operating costs and expenses in non essential areas in response to the expected decrease in revenues 
strategy we seek to secure and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve by developing market leading clusters of radio stations in each of our markets 
we operate our radio stations in clusters to capture a variety of demographic listener groups  which we believe enhances our radio stations appeal to a wide range of advertisers 
in addition  we have been able to achieve operating efficiencies by consolidating office and studio space where possible to minimize duplicative management positions and reduce overhead expenses 
finally  we will consider opportunities to swap existing radio stations with other radio station owners in new or existing markets 
current fcc rules and regulations do not allow us to add any more radio stations to our existing clusters in the fayetteville  nc  greenville new bern jacksonville  nc  and augusta  ga radio markets 
we also continue to invest in interactive support services to develop and promote our radio station websites 
we derive revenue from our websites through the sale of advertiser promotions and advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising airtime during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet 

table of contents competition the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive 
our radio stations compete for listeners and advertising revenue within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media such as over the air and cable television  newspapers and magazines  outdoor advertising  direct mail  satellite radio  cellular phones and other wireless media  the internet  and other forms of advertising 
radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group 
by building a strong listener base consisting of a specific demographic group in each of our markets  we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners 
the following are some of the factors that we believe are important to a radio station s competitive position i transmitter power  ii management experience  iii assigned frequency  iv audience characteristics  v local program acceptance  and vi the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area 
we attempt to improve our competitive position with promotional campaigns aimed at the demographic groups targeted by our radio stations and by sales efforts designed to attract advertisers 
we conduct extensive market research in an effort to enhance our audience ratings and  in certain circumstances  to identify opportunities to reformat radio stations to reach underserved demographic groups and increase advertising revenue 
our research  programming and promotions strategy combines thorough research with an assessment of our competitors vulnerabilities and overall market dynamics in order to identify specific audience and formatting opportunities within each market 
using this research  we tailor our programming and promotions on each radio station to maximize its appeal to its target audience and to respond to the changing preferences of our listeners 
our radio stations pursue a variety of programming and promotional initiatives designed to develop a distinctive identity and to strengthen the radio stations local brand or franchise 
in addition  through our research  programming and promotional initiatives  we create a marketable identity for our radio stations to enhance audience share and listener loyalty 
hd radio the fcc selected in band on channel as the exclusive technology for introduction of terrestrial digital operations by am and fm radio stations 
the technology is also known as hd radio 
the advantages of digital audio broadcasting over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality  additional channels and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services 
hd radio technology permits a radio station to transmit radio programming in both analog and digital formats  and eventually in digital only formats  using the bandwidth that the radio station is currently licensed to use 
it is unclear what impact the introduction of digital broadcasting will have on the radio markets in which we compete 
the fcc has authorized use of hd radio digital technology developed by ibiquity digital corporation  or ibiquity  on fm and am stations full time 
the fcc has adopted certain rules applicable to digital radio and is continuing to consider final rules for the service 
we currently utilize hd radio digital technology on a number of our stations and plan to install this technology on most of our other stations over the next few years 
in addition to committing to the use of this technology  we also hold a small equity interest in ibiquity 
we are also a member of the hd digital radio alliance association  which has been formed to promote and develop hd radio and its digital multicast operations 
seasonality seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures 
our net revenues are typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 

table of contents employees as of february   we had a staff of full time employees and part time employees 
we are a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the american federation of television and radio artists

federal regulation of radio broadcasting the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulation of  among other things  program and advertising content including determination of indecency standards  technical operations and business and employment practices 
this regulatory regime is administered by the federal communications commission  or fcc  which regulates radio station ownership  operation and transfer 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands for broadcasting  determines the particular frequencies  locations  operating powers and other technical parameters of radio stations  issues  renews  revokes  conditions and modifies radio station licenses  determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of radio station licenses  regulates equipment used by radio stations  and adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly affect the ownership  operation and employment practices of radio stations 
the fcc has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the communications act  including the imposition of monetary forfeitures  the issuance of short term licenses  the imposition of a condition on the renewal of a license  and  in egregious cases  non renewal of licenses and the revocation of licenses 
the following is a brief summary of some provisions of the communications act and of certain specific fcc rules and policies 
the summary is not a comprehensive listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations 
for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations  you should refer to the communications act  fcc rules and fcc public notices and rulings 

table of contents fcc licenses 
radio stations operate pursuant to broadcasting licenses that are ordinarily granted by the fcc for renewable terms of eight years 
a radio station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending 
during the periods when renewal applications are pending  petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
historically  fcc licenses have generally been renewed  and in the last renewal cycle  all of our licenses were renewed 
we have no reason to believe that our licenses will not be renewed  although there can be no assurance to that effect 
the non renewal of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in a pending rule making proceeding  the fcc has sought comments on the adoption of processing guidelines for renewal applications regarding a station s locally oriented programming performance 
the effect of whether and to what extent any such requirements are ultimately adopted and become effective cannot currently be determined 
the fcc classifies each am and fm radio station 
an am radio station operates on either a clear channel  regional channel or local channel 
a clear channel is one on which am radio stations are assigned to serve wide areas 
clear channel am radio stations are classified as either class a radio stations  which operate on an unlimited time basis and are designated to render primary and secondary service over an extended area  class b radio stations  which operate on an unlimited time basis and are designed to render service only over a primary service area  or class d am radio stations  which operate either during daytime hours only  during limited times only or on an unlimited time basis with low nighttime power 
a regional channel is one on which class b and class d am radio stations may operate and serve primarily a principal center of population and the rural areas contiguous to it 
a local channel is one on which am radio stations operate on an unlimited time basis and serve primarily a community and the immediately contiguous suburban and rural areas 
class c am radio stations operate on a local channel and are designed to render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference 
the fcc has authorized an additional khz of bandwidth for the am band and has allotted frequencies in this new band to certain existing am radio station licensees that applied for migration to the expanded am band  including one of our radio stations  subject to the requirement that at the end of a transition period  those licensees return to the fcc the license for one of the am band radio stations 
upon the completion of the migration process  it is expected that some am radio stations will have improved coverage because of reduced interference 
we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of the migration process on our operations but believe that such impact will not be material 
we currently operate wrdw am on khz in the expanded am band 
current fcc requirements call for surrender of either the expanded band license for wrdw am or the existing band license for wgus am in augusta  ga 
this surrender obligation is currently suspended while the fcc evaluates third party proposals to allow for the sale rather than surrender of one of the two licenses  including a proposal to allow such a sale to a qualifying small business 
the surrender of either license would have no material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the class of an fm radio station determines its minimum and maximum facilities requirements 
fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the fm radio station is located 
in general  commercial fm radio stations are classified as follows  in order of increasing power and antenna height class a  b  c  b  c  c  c and c 
in addition  the fcc rules subject class c fm radio stations that do not satisfy a certain antenna height requirement to an involuntary downgrade in class to class c under certain circumstances 
the following table sets forth the market served the fcc designated city of license may differ  call letters  fcc license classification  frequency  power and fcc license expiration date of each of the radio stations that we own including both the existing band license for wgus am and the expanded band license for wrdw am in augusta  ga 
in many cases  our licenses are held by wholly owned indirect subsidiaries 
pursuant to fcc rules and regulations  many am radio stations are licensed to operate at a reduced power during the nighttime broadcasting hours  which can result in reducing the radio station s coverage during the nighttime hours of operation 
both daytime and nighttime power is shown  where applicable 
for fm radio stations  the maximum effective radiated power in the main lobe is given

other complaints involving the broadcast of alleged indecent or profane material by radio stations we own remain pending 

table of contents indecency regulation 
the fcc s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and pm 
broadcasters risk of violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material is increased by the vagueness of the fcc s definition of indecent material  coupled with the spontaneity of live programming 
the fcc in the last few years has stepped up its enforcement activities as they apply to indecency  and has threatened to initiate license revocation or license renewal proceedings against broadcast licensees for a category of undefined serious indecency violations 
the fcc has also expanded the breadth of indecency regulation to include material that could be considered blasphemy personally reviling epithets  profanity and vulgar or coarse words amounting to a nuisance 
legislation has also been enacted that substantially increases the monetary penalties for broadcasting indecent programming 
other legislative proposals have been keyed to the number of violations found by the fcc and would potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
several appeals of certain of the fcc s recent enforcement actions and of the fcc s underlying indecency standards are pending in the federal courts 
formerly  the maximum permitted fines for adjudicated violations of the fcc s indecency rules were  per instance and  for each continuing violation 
in june  congress increased the maximum permitted fines to  per incident and  for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act 
the fcc implemented the increased forfeiture amounts in july because the fcc may investigate indecency complaints prior to notifying a licensee of the existence of a complaint  a licensee may not have knowledge of a complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal fcc letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture 
certain aspects of the fcc s indecency rules have been recently vacated by the us court of appeals for the second circuit the second circuit and remanded for further action by the fcc  and the government s appeal from the court s decision has recently been argued before the us supreme court 
a separate case involving other aspects of the fcc s indecency rules has been vacated by the us court of appeals for the third circuit and remanded to the fcc for further action 
the government has sought to appeal this decision before the us supreme court  and has asked any such appeal be held in abeyance until the second circuit case is decided 
proposals for new federal legislation regarding the broadcast of indecent programming  even if inadvertent and consisting of but a single word  have been introduced in congress  but to date none has been enacted 
certain of our radio stations are currently subject to enforcement inquiries with respect to alleged indecency violations 
the increased forfeiture amounts do not apply to any of these pending inquiries 
see fcc licenses above 
transfers or assignment of license 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of broadcast licenses or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to grant such approval  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee and proposed licensee  including compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties in a given market  the character of the licensee and those persons holding attributable interests in the licensee  and compliance with the communications act s limitations on alien ownership as well as compliance with other fcc regulations and policies 
to obtain fcc consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license  appropriate applications must be filed with the fcc 
interested parties  including members of the public  have the opportunity to file objections against assignment and transfer of control applications 
multiple and cross ownership rules 
the communications act and fcc rules impose specific limits on the number of commercial radio stations an entity can own  directly or by attribution  in a single market and the combination of radio stations  television stations and newspapers that any entity can own  directly or by attribution  in a single market 
digital radio channels authorized for am and fm stations do not count as separate stations for purposes of the ownership limits 
the radio multiple ownership rules may preclude us from acquiring certain radio stations we might otherwise seek to acquire 
the ownership rules also effectively prevent us from selling radio stations in a market to a buyer that has reached its ownership limit in the market unless that buyer divests other radio stations 

table of contents local radio ownership rule 
the local radio ownership rule establishes the following limits in markets with or more radio stations  ownership is limited to eight commercial radio stations  no more than five of which can be either am or fm  in markets with to radio stations  ownership is limited to seven commercial radio stations  no more than four of which can be either am or fm  in markets with to radio stations  ownership is limited to six commercial radio stations  no more than four of which can be either am or fm  and in markets with or fewer radio stations  ownership is limited to five commercial radio stations or no more than of the market s total  whichever is lower  and no more than three of which can be either am or fm 
in june  the fcc adopted rules  which changed the methodology by which it defines a particular radio market and counts radio stations to determine compliance with the radio multiple ownership restrictions 
such changes generally reduce the number of radio stations counted as being in a market 
the fcc s rules also provide that parties which own groups of radio stations that comply with the previous multiple ownership rules  but do not comply with the new limits  will be allowed to retain those groups on a grandfathered basis  but will not be allowed to transfer or assign those groups intact unless such transfer or assignment is to certain eligible small businesses 
under these rules  our ability to transfer or assign our radio stations as a group to a single buyer in one of our current markets may be limited 
in june  the united states court of appeals for the third circuit remanded to the fcc for further justification or modification the fcc s decision to retain the numerical limits on local radio ownership set forth above 
in an order adopted in december  the fcc declined to make any further changes to the local radio ownership rule 
radio television cross ownership rule 
the fcc s radio television cross ownership rule permits a single owner to own or control up to two television stations  consistent with the fcc s rules on common ownership of television stations  together with one radio station in all markets 
in addition  an owner will be permitted to own additional radio stations  not to exceed the local radio ownership limits for the market  as follows in markets where media voices will remain after the consummation of the proposed transaction  an owner may own an additional five radio stations  or  if the owner only has one television station  an additional six radio stations  and in markets where media voices will remain after the consummation of the proposed transaction  an owner may own an additional three radio stations 
a media voice generally includes each independently owned  full power television and radio station and each daily newspaper  plus one cable television system per market 
newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule 
the fcc s currently effective newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule prohibits the same owner from owning a broadcast station and a daily english language newspaper in the same geographic market if specified signal contours of the television or radio station encompass the entire community in which the newspaper is published  unless such ownership is grandfathered or subject to a waiver 
in december  the fcc modified this rule to adopt a rebuttable presumption permitting the cross ownership of one newspaper and one television or radio station in the top twenty markets under certain circumstances  and establishing a waiver procedure for such combinations in markets smaller than the top twenty 
the fcc s order is subject to administrative and judicial appeal 
ownership attribution 
the fcc generally applies its ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
in the case of corporations controlling broadcast licenses  the interests of officers  directors and those who  directly or indirectly  have the right to vote or more of the corporation s voting stock are generally attributable 
however  certain passive investors are 
table of contents attributable only if they hold or more of the corporation s voting stock 
in addition  the interests of minority shareholders in a corporation generally are not attributable if a single entity or individual holds or more of that corporation s voting stock 
the fcc also has a rule  known as the equity debt plus rule  which causes certain creditors or investors to be attributable owners of a radio station 
under this rule  a major programming supplier or a same market owner will be an attributable owner of a radio station if the supplier or owner holds debt or equity  or both  in the radio station that is greater than of the value of the radio station s total debt plus equity 
a major programming supplier includes any programming supplier that provides more than of the radio station s weekly programming hours 
a same market owner includes any attributable owner of a media company  including broadcast stations  cable television and newspapers  located in the same market as the radio station  but only if the owner is attributable under an fcc attribution rule other than the equity debt plus rule 
the attribution rules limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any market 
alien ownership rules 
the communications act prohibits the issuance or holding of broadcast licenses by persons who are not us citizens  whom the fcc rules refer to as aliens  including any corporation if more than of its capital stock is owned or voted by aliens 
in addition  the fcc may prohibit any corporation from holding a broadcast license if the corporation is controlled by any other corporation of which more than of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens  if the fcc finds that the prohibition is in the public interest 
our certificate of incorporation prohibits the ownership  voting and transfer of our capital stock in violation of the fcc restrictions  and prohibits the issuance of capital stock or the voting rights such capital stock represents to or for the account of aliens or corporations otherwise subject to domination or control by aliens in excess of the fcc limits 
the certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to enforce these prohibitions 
for example  the certificate of incorporation provides for the redemption of shares of our capital stock by action of the board of directors to the extent necessary to comply with these alien ownership restrictions 
time brokerage agreements 
it is not uncommon for radio stations to enter into what have commonly been referred to as time brokerage agreements 
while these agreements may take varying forms  under a typical time brokerage agreement  separately owned and licensed radio stations agree to enter into cooperative arrangements of varying sorts  subject to compliance with the requirements of antitrust laws and with fcc s rules and policies 
under these arrangements  separately owned radio stations could agree to function cooperatively in programming  advertising sales and similar matters  subject to the requirement that the licensee of each radio station maintain independent control over the programming and operations of its own radio station 
one typical type of time brokerage agreement is a programming agreement between two separately owned radio stations serving a common service area  whereby the licensee of one radio station provides substantial portions of the broadcast programming for airing on the other licensee s radio station  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee  and sells advertising time during those program segments 
the fcc s rules provide that a radio station that brokers more than of the weekly broadcast time on another radio station serving the same market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered radio station for purposes of fcc s local radio ownership limits 
as a result  in a market where we own a radio station  we would not be permitted to enter into a time brokerage agreement with another radio station in the same market if we could not own the brokered radio station under the multiple ownership rules  unless our programming on the brokered radio station constituted or less of the brokered radio station s programming time on a weekly basis 
fcc rules also prohibit a broadcast station from duplicating more than of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service  that is am am or fm fm  either through common ownership of the two radio stations or through a time brokerage agreement  where the brokered and brokering radio stations which it owns or programs serve substantially the same area 
radio stations may also enter into what are commonly known as joint sales agreements 
in a typical joint sales agreement  separately owned and licensed radio stations agree to enter into cooperative arrangements involving the sale of advertising time and the collection of proceeds from such sales  but involving no or only a 
table of contents limited amount of programming time 
such arrangements are subject to compliance with the requirements of the antitrust laws and the fcc s rules and policies 
a radio station that sells more than of the weekly advertising time of another radio station serving the same market is deemed to have an attributable interest in that other radio station 
programming and operations 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
the fcc gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed in the past to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a radio station s community of license  although recently launched rulemaking proceedings propose to implement various requirements aimed at increasing local programming content and diversity 
if adopted  these new requirements would impose new record keeping and other burdens on our radio stations 
under the currently effective rules  a licensee is required to present programming that is responsive to issues of the radio station s community of license and to maintain records demonstrating this responsiveness 
complaints from listeners concerning a radio station s programming often will be considered by the fcc when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee  although listener complaints may be filed and considered by the fcc at any time 
such complaints are required to be maintained in the radio station s public file 
radio stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the communications act 
those rules regulate  among other things  political advertising  sponsorship identifications  the advertisement of contests and lotteries  employment practices  obscene and indecent broadcasts and technical operations  including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation 
the fcc s rules on equal employment opportunities prohibit employment discrimination by radio stations on the basis of race  religion  color  national origin  and gender  and require broadcasters to implement programs to promote equal employment opportunities at their radio stations 
the rules generally require broadcasters to widely disseminate information about full time job openings to all segments of the community to ensure that all qualified applicants have sufficient opportunity to apply for the job  to send job vacancy announcements to recruitment organizations and others in the community indicating an interest in all or some vacancies at the radio station  and to implement a number of specific longer term recruitment outreach efforts  such as job fairs  internship programs  and interaction with educational and community groups from among a menu of approaches itemized by the fcc 
radio stations with ten or more full time employees in a given market must file a mid term eeo report with the fcc midway through the license term 
broadcasters must prepare and place in their public files and on their websites an annual eeo report  and file the previous two reports with the fcc along with the mid term eeo report and the renewal application 
fcc decisions hold that a broadcast station may not deny a candidate for federal political office a request for broadcast advertising time solely on the grounds that the amount of time requested is not the standard length of time  which the radio station offers to its commercial advertisers 
this policy has not had a material impact on our programming and commercial advertising operations but the policy s future impact is uncertain 
proposed and recent changes 
congress and the fcc may in the future consider and adopt new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect  directly or indirectly  the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  including the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations  and an inability to acquire additional radio stations or to finance those acquisitions 
such matters may include changes in the fcc s multiple ownership  cross ownership and attribution policies  regulatory fees  spectrum use fees or other fees on fcc licenses  recently approved increases in the royalties paid by radio stations with respect to internet streaming  foreign ownership of broadcast licenses  revisions to the fcc s rules relating to political broadcasting  including free airtime to candidates  technical and frequency allocation matters  
table of contents proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer  wine and other alcoholic beverages on radio  proposals to require radio broadcasters to pay royalties to musicians and record labels for the performance of music played on the stations  proposals to limit the tax deductibility of or impose sales tax on advertising expenses by advertisers  and proposals to regulate or prohibit payments to stations by independent record promoters  record labels and others for the inclusion of specific content in broadcast programming 
the fcc has recently adopted a standardized issues programming form for use by television stations  and is considering requiring the use of the same or a similar form by radio stations 
this form requests detailed information concerning what steps a station undertook to determine the issues of concern within its local market  and what amount and nature of news and public service programming was presented to address those issues 
in addition  the fcc has released a proceeding in which it has proposed a variety of rules to enhance localism concerns  including the possibility of readopting programming standards  based perhaps on the data obtained by the new issues programming forms  requiring that the main studio of each station be located within the boundaries of its community of license and staffed on a fulltime basis  and other proposals 
the fcc has also adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed for new or major change applications that are mutually exclusive 
such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our radio stations 
we cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the fcc or congress  nor can we judge in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business 
federal antitrust laws 
the agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws  the federal trade commission or the department of justice  may investigate certain acquisitions 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific ftc or department of justice investigation 
any decision by the ftc or the department of justice to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate the acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms 
for an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds  the hart scott rodino act requires the parties to file notification and report forms concerning antitrust issues with the ftc and the department of justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition 
if the investigating agency raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction  then the parties frequently engage in lengthy discussions or negotiations with the investigating agency concerning possible means of addressing those issues  including restructuring the proposed acquisition or divesting assets 
in addition  the investigating agency could file suit in federal court to enjoin the acquisition or to require the divestiture of assets  among other remedies 
in addition  acquisitions  whether or not required to be reported under the hart scott rodino act  may be investigated by the ftc  the department of justice or other state authorities under the antitrust laws before or after consummation 
in addition  private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws 
as part of its increased scrutiny of radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that local marketing agreements  joint sales agreements  time brokerage agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers could violate the hart scott rodino act if such agreements take effect prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act 
furthermore  the department of justice has noted that joint sales agreements may raise antitrust concerns under section of the sherman act and has challenged joint sales agreements in certain locations 
the department of justice also has stated publicly that it has established certain revenue and audience share concentration benchmarks with respect to radio station acquisitions  above which a transaction may receive additional antitrust scrutiny 
however  to date  the department of justice has also investigated transactions that do not meet or exceed these benchmarks and has cleared transactions that do exceed these benchmarks

risk factors cautionary note regarding forward looking statements our form k disclosure and analysis concerning our operations  cash flows and financial position  including  in particular  the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
although these statements are based upon assumptions we consider reasonable  they are subject to risks and uncertainties that are described more fully below 
accordingly  we can give no assurance that we will achieve the results anticipated or implied by our forward looking statements 
the radio broadcasting industry faces many unpredictable business risks and is sensitive to external economic forces that could have a material adverse affect on our advertising revenues and results of operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
these risks include  but are not limited to shifts in population  demographics or audience preferences  increased competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  television stations  newspapers and magazines  outdoor advertising  direct mail  satellite radio  cellular phones and other wireless media  the internet and other forms of advertising  and changes in government regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the federal communications commission  internal revenue service  united states department of justice  and the federal trade commission 
in addition  we believe that for most businesses advertising is a discretionary business expense  meaning that spending on advertising tends to decline disproportionately during economic recession or downturn as compared to other types of business spending 
as widely reported  financial markets in the united states have been experiencing extreme disruption 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term and wide spread recession  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  and the housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the united states economy 
these unfavorable changes in economic conditions as well as declining consumer confidence  recession and other factors  have led and could continue to lead to decreased demand for advertising and have negatively impacted our advertising revenues and our results of operations 
we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or duration of any economic downturn generally  or in the markets in which our advertisers operate 
if the current environment does continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience a further decline in revenues  which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues  which could adversely affect our revenue and cash flow 
we operate in a highly competitive business 
a decline in our audience share or advertising rates in a particular market may cause a decline in the revenue and cash flow of our stations located in that market 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media outlets 
these other media outlets include over the air and cable television  newspapers and magazines  outdoor advertising  direct mail  satellite radio  cellular phones and other wireless media  the internet and other forms of advertising 

table of contents our radio stations could suffer a reduction in audience ratings or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses if another radio station in a market was to convert its programming to a format similar to  and thereby compete more directly with  one of our radio stations  or a new radio station was to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to improve its audience share 
a current or new advertising alternative increased its share of local and national advertising revenue 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter into markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
our radio stations may not be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
we may not remain competitive if we do not respond to changes in technology  standards and services that affect our industry 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of other media technologies and services 
we may not have the resources to acquire and deploy other technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these other technologies 
competition arising from other technologies or regulatory change may have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry or on our company 
various other audio technologies and services that have been developed and introduced  include personal digital audio devices eg cellular phones  ipods  mp players  satellite delivered digital audio radio services that offer numerous programming channels and the sound quality of compact discs  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers  personal communications services and other digital audio broadcast formats  hd radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which has resulted in non commercial fm radio broadcast outlets that serve small  localized areas 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from other technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have substantial debt that could have important consequences to you 
we have debt that is substantial in relation to our stockholders equity 
as of december   we had long term debt of million and stockholders equity of million 
our long term debt is substantial in amount and could have an impact on you 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including ongoing capital expenditures and future acquisitions  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 

table of contents our ability to reduce our total leverage ratio by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under our credit facility 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our debt and the associated risks 
in addition  there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available or on terms that will be acceptable to us 
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants  which may restrict our operational flexibility 
our credit facility contains various financial and operating covenants  including  among other things  restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  subject our assets to additional liens  enter into certain investments  consolidate  merge or effect asset sales  enter into sale and lease back transactions  sell or discount accounts receivable  enter into transactions with our affiliates or stockholders  change the nature of our business  pay dividends on and redeem or repurchase capital stock  or make other restricted payments 
these restrictions could limit our ability to take actions that require funds in excess of those available to us 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests 
the current economic downturn has decreased demand for advertising and has negatively impacted our revenues 
if our revenues were to decrease significantly it may become increasingly difficult for us to meet these financial covenants 
in response we will continue to control costs and expenses in non essential areas 
our breach of any of these covenants  ratios  tests or restrictions could result in an event of default under our credit facility 
if an event of default exists under our credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable 
if the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness which could force us to seek protection under federal bankruptcy laws and could significantly or entirely reduce the value of our equity 
we may also incur future debt obligations in addition to  or in lieu of  our credit facility 
such future debt obligations might subject us to additional and different restrictive covenants that could further limit our operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted for renewable terms of eight years 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full eight year terms or will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate any future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest one or more radio stations 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents a downturn in the performance of our radio stations in miami ft

a ratings decline or other operating difficulty in the performance of our radio stations in miami ft 
lauderdale or philadelphia could have a disproportionately adverse affect on our net revenue 
these radio stations contributed of our net revenue during because of the large portion of our net revenue from miami ft

a future impairment of our fcc broadcasting licenses and or goodwill could adversely affect our operating results 
as of december   our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill represented of our total assets 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill for impairment at least annually which may result in future impairment losses 
in  we recorded impairment losses of million related to the fcc broadcasting licenses in our wilmington  de  las vegas  nv  augusta  ga  west palm beach boca raton  fl  atlanta  ga and boston  ma market clusters and impairment losses of million related to the goodwill recorded in our wilmington  de  las vegas  nv and augusta  ga market clusters

our corporate offices and several of our radio stations are located in florida and other areas that could be affected by hurricanes 
florida is susceptible to hurricanes and we have our corporate offices and eleven radio stations located there 
these radio stations contributed of our net revenue during although the hurricane season did not have a material impact on our operations  our corporate offices and our radio stations located in florida and along the coast of north carolina could be materially affected by hurricanes in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we carry property damage insurance on all of our properties and business interruption insurance on some of our properties  but there can be no assurance that such insurance would be adequate to cover all of our hurricane related losses 
the fcc continues vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the fcc s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and pm 
broadcasters risk of violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material is increased by the vagueness of the fcc s definition of indecent material  coupled with the spontaneity of live programming 
the fcc in the last few years has stepped up its enforcement activities as they apply to indecency  and has threatened to initiate license revocation or license renewal proceedings against broadcast licensees for a category of undefined serious indecency violations 
the fcc has also expanded the breadth of indecency regulation to include material that could be considered blasphemy personally reviling epithets  profanity and vulgar or coarse words amounting to a nuisance 
as a result  in the event that we broadcast material falling within the expanded breadth of the fcc s regulation  we could be subject to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings  which would put the licenses that we depend on for our operations in jeopardy 
legislation has also been enacted that substantially increases the monetary penalties for broadcasting indecent programming 
other legislative proposals have been keyed to the number of violations found by the fcc and would potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
several appeals of certain of the fcc s recent enforcement actions and of the fcc s underlying indecency standards are pending in the federal courts 
formerly  the maximum permitted fines for adjudicated violations of the fcc s indecency rules were  per instance and  for each continuing violation 
in june  congress increased the maximum permitted fines to  per incident and  for any continuing 
table of contents violation arising from a single act or failure to act 
the fcc implemented the increased forfeiture amounts in july because the fcc may investigate indecency complaints prior to notifying a licensee of the existence of a complaint  a licensee may not have knowledge of a complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal fcc letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture 
we may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our radio stations broadcast of indecent or obscene material 
to the extent that these pending inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines  revocation of any of our radio station licenses or denials of license renewal applications  our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected 
our business depends on the efforts of key personnel and the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees  including george g 
beasley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
beasley is years old 
we believe the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by mr 
beasley would be difficult to replace and that the loss of mr 
beasley s or other key executives expertise could impair our ability to execute our operating and acquisition strategies 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer controls beasley broadcast group  inc and members of his immediate family own a substantial equity interest in beasley broadcast group  inc their interests may conflict with yours 
george g 
beasley is generally able to control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
without the approval of mr 
beasley  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change in control  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
shares of class b common stock that mr 
beasley beneficially owns represent of the total voting power of all classes of our common stock 
mr 
beasley also has currently exercisable stock options to purchase  shares of class a common stock 
members of his immediate family also own significant amounts of class b common stock and class a common stock 
mr 
beasley will be able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation  third amended and restated bylaws or applicable law 
historically  we have entered into certain transactions with george g 
beasley  members of his immediate family and affiliated entities that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders now or in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation related party transactions and note to the accompanying financial statements 
future sales by george g 
beasley or members of his family of our class a common stock could adversely affect its market price 
george g 
beasley and members of his family beneficially own the majority of all outstanding shares of class b common stock  which is convertible to class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the market for our class a common stock could change substantially if george g 
beasley and members of his family convert their shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock and then sell large amounts of shares of class a common stock in the public market 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equity related securities in the future 
the difficulties associated with any attempt to gain control of our company may adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 
due to his large holdings of our common stock  george g 
beasley controls the decision whether any change of control of the company will occur 
moreover  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change 
table of contents of control could be beneficial to you 
in addition  the communications act and fcc rules and policies limit the number of stations that one individual or entity can own  directly or by attribution  in a market 
fcc approval for transfers of control of fcc licensees and assignments of fcc licenses are also required 
because of the limitations and restrictions imposed on us by these provisions and regulations  the trading price of our class a common stock may be adversely affected 
there may not be an active market for our class a common stock  making it difficult for you to sell your stock 
our stock may not be actively traded in the future 
an illiquid market for our stock may result in price volatility and poor execution of buy and sell orders for investors 
our stock price and trading volume have fluctuated widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons that may be unrelated to our business or results of operations 
this market volatility could depress the price of our class a common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our class a common stock could decrease  perhaps significantly

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a radio broadcasting company whose primary business is operating radio stations throughout the united states 
we own and operate radio stations in the following markets philadelphia  pa  atlanta  ga  boston  ma  miami ft 
lauderdale  fl  las vegas  nv  west palm beach boca raton  fl  ft 
myers naples  fl  wilmington  de  greenville new bern jacksonville  nc  augusta  ga and fayetteville  nc 
we refer to each group of radio stations that we own in each radio market as a market cluster 
recent developments on march   our credit facility was amended to  among other things  reduce the maximum commitment under the revolving credit loan  increase the interest rate margin  revise certain financial covenants  reduce the aggregate dollar amount of company shares we are able to repurchase  and reduce the amount of dividends we are able to pay on our common stock 
we tested our fcc broadcasting licenses for impairment during the fourth quarter of as a result of the testing  we recorded impairment losses of million related to the fcc broadcasting licenses in our wilmington  de  las vegas  nv  augusta  ga  west palm beach boca raton  fl  atlanta  ga and boston  ma market clusters 
the impairment losses were primarily due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates in these markets 
advertising revenue declined moderately during the first three quarters then significantly during the fourth quarter of  which determined the timing of the impairment test 
for further discussion  see critical accounting estimates below 
we tested our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of as a result of the testing  we recorded impairment losses of million related to the goodwill recorded in our wilmington  de  las vegas  nv and augusta  ga market clusters 
the impairment losses were primarily due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates in these markets 
advertising revenue declined moderately during the first three quarters then significantly during the fourth quarter of  which determined the timing of the impairment test 
for further discussion  see critical accounting estimates below 
we continue to be impacted by deteriorating general economic conditions  which have caused a downturn in the advertising industry 
the decreased demand for advertising has negatively impacted our revenues 
we expect the current environment to continue for some time and for our revenues to be adversely impacted during that time 
we will continue to review our operating costs and expenses in non essential areas in response to the expected decrease in revenues 
financial statement presentation the following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our financial statements and general factors that impact these items 
net revenue 
our net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions  generally of gross revenue 
local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to advertisers in a radio station s local market either directly to the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency 
national revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
national sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm  which serves as our agent in these transactions 

table of contents the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels generally determine our net revenue 
advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations  as well as other forms of media  in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and the size of the market 
our net revenue is affected by general economic conditions  competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the radio broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
our revenues are typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
a growing source of revenue comes from our radio station websites primarily through the sale of advertiser promotions and advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising airtime during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet 
our radio station websites contributed approximately million or and million or of net revenue during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we use trade sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services  however  we endeavor to minimize trade revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our trade sales revenue and expenses 
year ended december trade revenue trade expenses operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist primarily of programming  engineering  and promotional expenses  reported as cost of services  and selling  general and administrative expenses incurred at our radio stations  general and administrative expenses  including compensation and other expenses  incurred at our corporate offices  and depreciation and amortization 
we strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in and in  which differs from the federal statutory rate of due to the effect of state income taxes and certain of our expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents impairment of fcc broadcasting licenses 
as of december   fcc broadcasting licenses with an aggregate carrying amount of million represented of our total assets 
we are required to test our fcc broadcasting licenses for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that our licenses might be impaired 
the annual test  which is performed as of december  compares the fair value of our licenses with their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amounts of the licenses exceeds their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we combine our licenses into reporting units based on our market clusters for impairment testing purposes 
we estimate the fair value of our licenses using discounted future cash flows 
the discounted cash flow model includes certain assumptions including i the projected growth rate for radio advertising revenue in each market  ii average market share and profit margin for each class of license in each market  iii estimated capital start up capital costs  and iv the determination of an appropriate discount rate 
if we had made different assumptions or used different estimates the fair value of our licenses could have been materially different 
as a result of our annual test during the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairment losses of million related to the fcc broadcasting licenses in our wilmington  de  las vegas  nv  augusta  ga  west palm beach boca raton  fl  atlanta  ga and boston  ma market clusters 
the impairment losses were indicative of a trend in the broadcasting industry and were not unique to the company 
the losses represented of the aggregate carrying amount of our fcc broadcasting licenses prior to the impairment and were primarily due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates in these markets 
advertising revenue declined moderately during the first three quarters then significantly during the fourth quarter of which determined the timing of the impairment test 
there can be no assurance that additional impairments of our fcc broadcasting licenses will not occur in future periods 
impairment of goodwill 
as of december   goodwill with an aggregate carrying amount of million represented of our total assets 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill might be impaired 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their carrying amount  including goodwill 
for the purpose of testing our goodwill for impairment  we have identified our market clusters as our reporting units 
we use internally generated estimates of future cash flows to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
these estimates required management judgment and if we had made different assumptions the fair value of our reporting units could have been materially different 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its goodwill carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
in other words  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as a result of our annual test during the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairment losses of million related to the goodwill recorded in our wilmington  de  las vegas  nv and augusta  ga market clusters 
the impairment losses represented of the aggregate carrying amount of our goodwill prior to the impairment and were primarily due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates in these markets 
advertising revenue declined moderately during the first three quarters then significantly during the fourth quarter of which determined the timing of the impairment test 
there can be no assurance that impairments of our goodwill will not occur in future periods 

table of contents impairment of property and equipment 
we are required to assess the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever an event has occurred that may result in an impairment loss 
if such an event occurs  we will compare estimates of related future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we will reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value 
the determination of when an event has occurred and estimates of future cash flows and fair value all require management judgment 
the use of different assumptions or estimates may result in alternative assessments that could be materially different 
we did not identify any events that may have resulted in an impairment loss on our property and equipment in there can be no assurance that impairment of our property and equipment will not occur in future periods 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we continually evaluate our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
our ongoing evaluation includes review of specific accounts at our radio stations  the current financial condition of our customers and our historical write off experience 
this ongoing evaluation requires management judgment and if we had made different assumptions about these factors  the allowance for doubtful accounts could have been materially different 
recent pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations which replaces sfas  business combinations 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date 
sfas r also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well at the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values 
sfas r applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  adoption of sfas r will not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position but may have an impact on accounting for future business combinations 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intent of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas revised  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is prohibited 
adoption of fsp will not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position but may have an impact on accounting for future acquisitions 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december  and with respect to certain of our key financial measures 
these changes illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below 
this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in item of this report

our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit loan 
our primary liquidity needs have been  and for the next twelve months and thereafter are expected to continue to be  for working capital  debt service  and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and radio station acquisitions 
historically  our capital expenditures have not been significant 
in addition to property and equipment associated with radio station acquisitions  our capital expenditures have generally been  and are expected to continue to be  related to the maintenance of our studio and office space and the technological improvement  including upgrades necessary to broadcast hd radio  and maintenance of our broadcasting towers and equipment 
we have also purchased or constructed office and studio space in some of our markets to facilitate the consolidation of our operations

we expect to provide for future liquidity needs through one or a combination of the following sources of liquidity internally generated cash flow  our credit facility  additional borrowings  other than under our existing credit facility  to the extent permitted thereunder  and additional equity offerings 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to permit us to provide for our liquidity requirements and meet our financial obligations for the next twelve months 
however  continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in the united states or in the markets we serve  poor financial results  unanticipated acquisition opportunities or unanticipated expenses could give rise to defaults under our credit facility  additional debt servicing requirements or other additional financing or liquidity requirements sooner than we expect and we may not secure financing when needed or on acceptable terms 
our ability to reduce our total debt ratio  as defined by our credit facility  by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under the revolving portion of our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in the united states or in the markets we serve  poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility 
as of december   all of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point increase in the current interest rate under these borrowings  we estimate that our annualized interest expense would increase by million and our net income would decrease by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
as of december   we are a party to three interest rate swap agreements with a million notional amount 
the swap agreements expire from march to september as of december   the fair value of the swap agreements was a liability of million
