item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and all other statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  projections  and words of similar meaning  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
moreover  from time to time  we may issue other forward looking statements 
forward looking statements regarding financial performance in future periods  including the statements under outlook for fiscal  do not reflect potential impacts of mergers or acquisitions or other significant transactions or events that have not been announced as of the time the statements are made 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward looking statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations 
our business faces many risks  and set forth below are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
weakness in the united states us and international economies may harm our business 
the global economy is undergoing extraordinary volatility  with uncertainty in the credit markets and banking systems  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  and falling consumer confidence 
a number of our customers are also experiencing liquidity concerns  business insolvencies  and bankruptcies 
this volatility and uncertainty about future economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and postpone decisions to license or purchase products  decrease our customers spending  and jeopardize or delay our customers ability or willingness to make payment obligations  any of which could adversely affect our business 
we cannot predict the duration of the global economic downturn or subsequent recovery 
our revenue levels are generally dependent on the level of technology capital spending  which includes worldwide expenditures for electronic design automation eda software  hardware  and consulting services 
the us and international economies are cyclical and experience periodic economic downturns  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
weakness in these economies could materially adversely impact the timing and receipt of orders for our products and our results of operations 
weakness could also result in reduced growth  or even negative growth  in the revenue we obtain upon renewals of software term contracts with existing customers 
our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate 
our revenues  particularly new software license revenues  are difficult to forecast 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast revenues and trends in our business 
sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision  the dollar amount of the sale  and the products or services to be sold 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline 
our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  in part because the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate and requires management judgment 
a variation in the conversion rate could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
in particular  a slowdown in customer spending or weak economic conditions generally can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as purchasing decisions are delayed  reduced in amount  or cancelled 
the conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal quarter attempting to obtain more favorable terms 

table of contents our business could be impacted by fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns  the timing of significant orders  and the mix of licenses and products purchased by our customers 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  varied quarterly operating results 
various factors affect our quarterly operating results and some of these are not within our control  including customer demand and the timing of significant orders 
we typically experience seasonality in demand for our products  due to the purchasing cycles of our customers  with revenues in the fourth quarter generally being the highest 
in fiscal  we expect revenues to be unusually back end loaded in the second half of the year  due primarily to planned renewals of existing term contracts with large customers 
if these planned contract renewals are delayed or the average size of renewed contracts do not increase as we anticipate  we could fail to meet our and investors expectations  which could have a material adverse impact on our stock price 
our revenues are also affected by the mix of licenses entered into where we recognize software revenues as payments become due and payable  on a cash basis  or ratably over the license term as compared to revenues recognized at the beginning of the license term 
we recognize revenues ratably over the license term  for instance  when the customer is provided with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products 
a shift in the license mix toward increased ratable  due and payable  and or cash based revenue recognition could result in increased deferral of software revenues to future periods and would decrease current revenues  which could result in us not meeting near term revenue expectations 
the gross margin on our software is greater than that for our hardware emulation systems  software support  and professional services 
therefore  our gross margin may vary as a result of the mix of products and services sold 
we also have a significant amount of fixed or relatively fixed costs  such as employee costs and purchased technology amortization  and costs which are committed in advance and can only be adjusted periodically 
as a result  a small failure to reach planned revenues would likely have a relatively large negative effect on resulting earnings 
if anticipated revenues do not materialize as expected  our gross margins and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 
we face intense competition in the eda industry 
competition in the eda industry is intense  which can lead to  among other things  price reductions  longer selling cycles  lower product margins  loss of market share  and additional working capital requirements 
if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products  we may need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully 
any such changes would likely reduce margins and could materially adversely impact our operating results 
any broad based changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as the sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies 
some of our competitors may bundle certain software products at low prices for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy 
these practices could significantly reduce demand for our products or constrain prices we can charge 
we currently compete primarily with two large companies cadence design systems  inc cadence and synopsys  inc 
we also compete with numerous smaller companies and compete with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed their own eda products internally 
our international operations and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations expose us to additional risks 
we generate nearly two thirds of our revenues from customers outside the us and we generate approximately one third of our expenses outside the us significant changes in currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on us 
for further discussion of foreign currency effects  see effects of foreign currency fluctuations discussion in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  international operations subject us to other risks including longer receivables collection periods  changes in a specific country s or region s economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  local labor laws  import or export licensing requirements  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  limitations on repatriation of earnings  and difficulties with licensing and protecting our intellectual property rights 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from relatively few product groups 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of relatively few product groups and related support services 
as such  any factor adversely affecting sales of these products  including the product release cycles  market acceptance  product competition  performance and reliability  reputation  price competition  and economic and market conditions  could harm our operating results 

table of contents customer payment defaults or related issues could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered 
these customer obligations are typically not cancelable  but will not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults or declares bankruptcy and fails to pay amounts owed 
in these cases  we will generally take legal action to recover amounts owed 
moreover  existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses  particularly in the current troubled economic environment 
though we have not  to date  experienced a material level of defaults or renegotiated a material level of pre existing contractual commitments  any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these risks may be exacerbated by the current global economic downturn because our revenue forecasts assume i customers whose payments are recognized as revenue only when paid will make future payments as scheduled and ii customers whose credit ratings and financial circumstances have deteriorated since we originally booked contracts with them will make future payments as scheduled 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform an analysis on our goodwill balances to test for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events occur that may indicate impairment possibly exists 
goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or circumstances arise indicating that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment charge is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
as of january   we had a goodwill balance of million and intangible assets of million 
going forward  we will continue to review our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment or events or circumstances that would require us to test for impairment 
any impairment charges could adversely affect our future earnings 
goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment 
a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization below the carrying value of our reporting units would result in the need for us to test for impairment if we determine that the decline is sustained 
in recent months  our share price and market capitalization has significantly decreased 
conversely  the carrying value of our goodwill has increased with recent acquisitions  if current economic trends continue into the future  it is more likely than in the past that we may need to record impairment to goodwill 
we cannot be certain that a future downturn in our business  changes in market conditions or a longer term decline in our share price and market capitalization will not result in an impairment of goodwill and the recognition of a material impairment charge in future periods  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit ic and electronics systems industries 
purchases of our products and services are highly dependent upon new design projects initiated by customers in the ic and electronics systems industries 
these industries are highly cyclical and are subject to constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles  and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the ic and electronics systems industries regularly experience significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles within such companies or decline in general economic conditions 
these downturns could cause diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels  and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
customer payment defaults could harm our business 
we use fixed term license agreements as standard business practices with customers we believe are credit worthy 
these multi year  multi element term license agreements have payments spread over the license term and are typically about three years in length for semiconductor companies and about four years in length for military and aerospace companies 
the complexity of these agreements tends to increase the risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product dissatisfaction  disagreements  and disputes 
if we are unable to collect under these agreements  our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
we use these fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products  or services 
if we no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on the terms of the agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change could have a material impact on our results 

table of contents ic and printed circuit board pcb technology evolves rapidly 
the complexity of ics and pcbs continues to rapidly increase 
in response to this increasing complexity  new design tools and methodologies must be invented or acquired quickly to remain competitive 
if we fail to quickly respond to new technological developments  our products could become obsolete or uncompetitive  which could materially adversely impact our business 
errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 
our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications 
due to the complexity of the systems and products with which we work  some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace 
as a result  our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design  or the products or systems incorporating our designs and intellectual property may not operate as expected 
errors or defects could result in loss of current customers and loss of  or delay in  revenue and loss of market share  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources to resolve the problems resulting from errors or defects  and increased support or service costs 
in addition  we include third party technology in our products and we rely on those third parties to provide support services to us 
failure of those third parties to provide necessary support services could materially adversely impact our business 
long sales cycles and delay in customer completion of projects make the timing of our revenues difficult to predict 
we have a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends between three and six months 
a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process is generally required due to the complexity and expense associated with our products and services 
consequently  we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenues and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 
in addition  sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects due to customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance review procedures  timing of budget cycles  or timing of competitive evaluation processes 
disruptions of our indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results 
our indirect sales channel is comprised primarily of independent distributors and sales representatives 
our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our marketing and sales efforts 
our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated  if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate  if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant  or if the financial condition of our channel participants were to weaken 
in addition  we recently changed from a territory based sales organization to an account based organization with an increased emphasis upon our distributors and sales representatives 
if this transition takes longer than expected to fully implement  it could adversely affect our financial results in the short term 
any loss of our leadership position in certain segments of the eda market could harm our business 
the industry in which we compete is characterized by very strong leadership positions in specific segments of the eda market 
for example  one company may enjoy a large percentage of sales in the physical verification segment of the market while another will have a similarly strong position in mixed signal simulation 
these strong leadership positions can be maintained for significant periods of time as the software is difficult to master and customers are disinclined to make changes once their employees  as well as others in the industry  have developed familiarity with a particular software product 
for these reasons  much of our profitability arises from niche areas in which we are the leader 
conversely  it is difficult for us to achieve significant profits in niche areas where other companies are the leaders 
if for any reason we lose our leadership position in a niche  we could be materially adversely impacted 

table of contents accounting rules governing revenue recognition are complex and may change 
the accounting rules governing software revenue recognition are complex and have been subject to authoritative interpretations that have generally made it more difficult to recognize software revenues at the beginning of the license period 
if this trend continues  new and revised standards and interpretations could materially adversely impact our ability to meet near term revenue expectations 
if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow estimates  and slower growth rates in our industry 
we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
our tax expense may be impacted if our intercompany transactions  which are required to be computed on an arm s length basis  are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities 
also  our tax expense could be impacted depending on the applicability of withholding taxes on software licenses and related intercompany transactions in certain jurisdictions 
in determining the adequacy of income taxes  we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities examinations 
the irs and tax authorities in countries where we do business regularly examine our tax returns 
the ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations  we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
we were issued a revenue agent s report in march see provision for income taxes in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion 
forecasting our income tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty 
the computation of income tax expense benefit is complex as it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provision under us generally accepted accounting principles 
income tax expense benefit for interim quarters is based on a forecast of our global tax rate for the year  which includes forward looking financial projections  including the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction  and contains numerous assumptions 
various items cannot be accurately forecasted  and may be treated as discrete accounting 
examples of items which could cause variability in the rate include tax deductions for stock option expense  application of transfer pricing rules  and changes in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
future events  such as changes in our business and the tax law in the jurisdictions where we do business  could also affect our rate 
for these reasons  our global tax rate may be materially different than our forecast 
there are limitations on the effectiveness of controls 
we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us 

table of contents we may not realize revenues as a result of our investments in research and development 
we incur substantial expense to develop new software products 
research and development activities are often performed over long periods of time 
this effort may not yield a successful product offering or the product may not satisfy customer requirements 
as a result  we could realize little or no revenues related to our investment in research and development 
we may acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate them 
the industry in which we compete has seen significant consolidation in recent years 
during this period  we have acquired numerous businesses and have frequently been in discussions with potential acquisition candidates  and we may acquire other businesses in the future 
while we expect to carefully analyze all potential transactions before committing to them  we cannot assure that any transaction that is completed will result in long term benefits to us or our shareholders or that we will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively 
in addition  growth through acquisition involves a number of risks 
if any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business  it could materially adversely impact us difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from ongoing business when integrating the acquired business  the discovery after the acquisition has been completed of previously unknown liabilities assumed with the acquired business  the failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and increases in revenues  the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business in  for example  distribution  engineering  and customer support areas  unanticipated costs  unanticipated litigation in connection with or as a result of an acquisition  including claims from terminated employees  customers  or third parties  adverse impacts on existing relationships with suppliers and customers  and failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited experience 
acquired businesses may not perform as projected  which could result in impairment of acquisition related intangible assets 
additional challenges include integration of sales channels  training and education of the sales force for new product offerings  integration of product development efforts  integration of systems of internal controls  and integration of information systems 
accordingly  in any acquisition there will be uncertainty as to the achievement and timing of projected synergies  cost savings  and sales levels for acquired products 
all of these factors could impair our ability to forecast  meet revenues and earnings targets  and manage effectively our business for long term growth 
we cannot assure that we can effectively meet these challenges 
we may not adequately protect our proprietary rights or we may fail to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses 
our success depends  in large part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses  and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure that third parties will not try to challenge  invalidate  or circumvent these protections 
the companies in the eda industry  as well as entities and persons outside the industry  are obtaining patents at a rapid rate 
many of these entities have substantially larger patent portfolios than we have 
as a result  we may on occasion be forced to engage in costly patent litigation to protect our rights or defend our customers rights 
we may also need to settle these claims on terms that are unfavorable  such settlements could result in the payment of significant damages or royalties  or force us to stop selling or redesign one or more products 
we cannot assure that the rights granted under our patents will provide us with any competitive advantage  that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications  or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects these rights in the us some of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties  and we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future 
failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or rights from third parties on favorable terms could materially adversely impact us 

table of contents litigation may materially adversely impact us 
litigation may result in monetary damages  injunctions against future product sales  and substantial unanticipated legal costs and divert the efforts of management personnel  any and all of which could materially adversely impact us 
third parties may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights 
we periodically receive notices from others claiming infringement  or other misuse of their intellectual property rights or breach of our agreements with them 
we expect the number of such claims will increase as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows  the functionality of products overlap  the use and support of third party code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the software industry  and the volume of issued software patents continues to increase 
responding to any such claim  regardless of its validity  could be time consuming  costly  and or result in litigation  divert management s time and attention from developing our business  require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable  require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products  require us to release source code to third parties  possibly under open source license terms  require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers  or otherwise adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
our failure to attract and retain key employees may harm us 
we depend on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  our research and development staff  and a number of other key management  sales  support  technical  and services personnel 
competition for experienced  high quality personnel is intense  and we cannot assure that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel 
our failure to hire and retain such personnel could impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may materially adversely impact the markets on which our securities trade  the markets in which we operate  our operations  and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and investment in our business 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel more difficult and expensive and ultimately affect our revenues 
any armed conflict entered into by the us could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result from an armed conflict and could negatively impact our business 
we currently have operations in pakistan  egypt  india  and israel  countries that may be particularly susceptible to this risk 
the consequences of any armed conflict are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse impact on us 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in economic recession in the us or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues  and costs and could result in volatility of the market price for our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and oregon law may have anti takeover effects 
our board of directors has the authority  without action by the shareholders  to designate and issue up to  shares of incentive stock in one or more series and to designate the rights  preferences  and privileges of each series without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
additionally  the oregon control share act and the business combination act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us 
these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors 
the potential issuance of incentive stock and the provisions of the oregon control share act and the business combination act could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change of control of us  could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and could materially adversely impact the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 

table of contents we have a substantial level of indebtedness 
as of january   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  which includes million of floating rate convertible subordinated debentures floating rate debentures due  million of convertible subordinated debentures debentures due  and million in short term borrowings 
this level of indebtedness among other things could make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on our debt  make it difficult for us to incur additional indebtedness or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions  or general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under the floating rate debentures and debentures  and place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 
if we experience a decline in revenues  we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our stock price could become more volatile  and your investment could lose value 
all of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products  product enhancements  or technological advances by our competitors or us  and any announcements by us of acquisitions  major transactions  or management changes could also affect our stock price 
our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock  our credit ratings  and market trends unrelated to our performance 
as a result of cadence s unsolicited acquisition proposal during the second quarter of fiscal  and its subsequent withdrawal  the future trading price of our stock in the short term may be subject to wide price fluctuations 
a significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
our revolving credit facility has financial and non financial covenants  and default of any covenant could materially adversely impact us 
our bank revolving credit facility imposes operating restrictions on us in the form of financial and non financial covenants 
financial covenants include adjusted quick ratio  minimum tangible net worth  leverage ratio  senior leverage ratio  and minimum cash and accounts receivable ratio 
if we were to fail to comply with the financial covenants and did not obtain a waiver from our lenders  we would be in default under the revolving credit facility and our lenders could terminate the facility and demand immediate repayment of all outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility 
the declaration of an event of default could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we could also find it difficult to obtain other bank lines or credit facilities on comparable terms

table of contents the company we are a supplier of electronic design automation eda systems advanced computer software and emulation systems used to automate the design  analysis  and testing of electronic hardware and embedded systems software in electronic systems and components 
we market our products and services worldwide  primarily to large companies in the military aerospace  communications  computer  consumer electronics  semiconductor  networking  multimedia  and transportation industries 
through the diversification of our customer base among these various customer markets  we attempt to reduce our exposure to fluctuations within each market 
we sell and license our products through our direct sales force and a channel of distributors and sales representatives 
in addition to our corporate offices in wilsonville  oregon  we have sales  support  software development  and professional service offices worldwide 
business environment the eda industry is highly competitive and is characterized by very strong leadership positions in specific segments of the eda market 
these strong leadership positions can be maintained for significant periods of time as the software can be difficult to master and customers are disinclined to make changes once their employees  as well as others in the industry  have developed familiarity with a particular software product 
for these reasons  much of our profitability arises from niche areas in which we are the leader 
we will continue our strategy of developing high quality tools with number one market share potential  rather than being a broad line supplier with undifferentiated product offerings 
this strategy allows us to focus investment in areas where customer needs are greatest and we have the opportunity to build significant market share 
we derive system and software revenues primarily from the sale of term software license contracts  which are typically three to four years in length 
we generally recognize revenue for these arrangements upon product delivery at the beginning of the license term 
larger enterprise wide customer contracts  which typically represent over of our system and software revenue  drive the majority of our period to period revenue variances 
some of these contracts include unlimited or nearly unlimited access to a fixed list of products  which results in varied pricing discounts 
for these reasons  the timing and size of contract renewals is the primary driver of revenue changes from period to period 
our products and services are dependent to a large degree on new design projects initiated by customers in the integrated circuit ic and electronics system industries 
these industries can be cyclical and are subject to constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles  and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
business during the year ended january  slowed from levels achieved during fiscal  with bookings down compared to fiscal bookings are the value of executed orders during a period for which revenue has been or will be recognized within six months for products and within twelve months for professional services and training 
the ten largest transactions for fiscal accounted for approximately of total system and software bookings compared to for fiscal the number of new customers for fiscal was down from the levels experienced during fiscal for fiscal  as part of our planning process we targeted cost reductions of  to our base operating expenses in research and development expenses  marketing and selling expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
see operating expenses in this item for additional discussion 
known trends and uncertainties impacting future results of operations global market and economic conditions in the united states us and abroad  recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging  with tighter credit conditions  increased market volatility  diminished expectations for the us and global economies  and increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence  and increased unemployment have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
many lenders and institutional investors reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers due to concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of the counterparties specifically 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our customers  to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs and timely replace maturing liabilities  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents product developments during the year ended january   we continued to execute our strategy of focusing on challenges encountered by customers  as well as building upon our well established product families 
we believe that customers  faced with leading edge design challenges in creating new products  generally choose the best eda products in each category to build their design environment 
through both internal development and strategic acquisitions  we have focused on areas where we believe we can build a leading market position or extend an existing leading market position 
during the year ended january   we launched a number of new or improved products  which are chronologically listed below first quarter in february  we announced the questa multi view verification components product and the infact tm intelligent testbench automation tool two new solutions that accelerate verification and improve verification coverage of today s system on chip soc designs 
in march  we announced the questa codelink tm product  an addition to the questa functional verification platform designed to accelerate validation of application specific integrated circuits containing one or more embedded processors 
in april  we announced with agilent technologies  inc a jointly developed solution that can improve productivity for the design of radio frequency circuits on printed circuit boards pcbs 
we expect the solution to cut pcb design cycle times up to half and improve the quality of mixed technology designs 
second quarter in may  we acquired substantially all of the assets of ponte solutions  inc ponte  a developer of ic design for manufacturing products 
the acquisition was an investment aimed at expanding our design for manufacturing capabilities and was integrated into our calibre product family 
in june  we announced our ic implementation strategy to aid customers with the challenges of moving to smaller process nodes 
this strategy included the merger of our calibre physical verification and design for manufacturing platform  the olympus soc tm place and route system  and our design for test and yield learning solution into a single design to silicon division 
in june  we announced that infact tm  our award winning intelligent testbench automation tool  had been enhanced to enable large simulations to be automatically distributed across up to one thousand central processing units 
also in june  we announced our veloce family of hardware assisted verification products and the isolve tm multimedia product to accelerate the verification of multimedia products 
in july  we announced that our virtual prototyping tool  systemvision tm  supports design for six sigma methodologies to achieve cost effective design innovation by a model driven development process in the automotive industry 
also in july  we acquired the majority of the ordinary shares of flomerics group  plc flomerics  the market share leader in thermal analysis for electronics application and a technical leader in engineering fluid dynamics 
we are integrating the acquired technology into our mechanical analysis products 
third quarter in august  we announced that we are working together with altera corporation to develop tools and methodologies for use in creating do certifiable intellectual property 
enforced by worldwide aviation safety agencies since  the do standard was developed by the avionics industry to establish design assurance and guidance for airborne electronics hardware designs 
in september  we announced with ibm an agreement to jointly develop and distribute next generation computational lithography software solutions to enhance the imaging capability of lithographic systems used in the manufacturing of integrated circuits at the nanometer nm node and beyond 
also in september  we announced delivery of the industry s first design collaboration capability between electrical and mechanical design solutions enabling teams to use this solution from the design inception to the manufacturing process  helping electronics companies reduce electro mechanical design conflicts and develop complex products faster 

table of contents in october  we announced new technology in the olympus soc place and route system that allows timing analysis and optimizations tasks to run parallel and to deliver up to x improvement in timing analysis run times and up to x improvement in design closure times 
also in october  we announced that we had acquired all of the outstanding shares of flomerics 
fourth quarter in november  we announced a new version of the eldo transistor level analog simulator using multi threading technology to boost raw speed performance in very large post layout simulations  which are mandatory at nm processes and below to thoroughly verify a complex design 
in december  we unveiled the veloce maximus product  the industry s largest capacity hardware emulator at over half a billion gate capacity 
also in december  we announced the capital architect graphical design tool that helps automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers minimize cost and or weight of the electrical distribution system by optimizing its physical architecture 
in january  we further extended our leadership in high level synthesis with the acquisition of the c synthesis assets of agility design solutions  inc also in january  we announced a new functional design methodology based on a layered transaction level module 
this functional design flow  which uses vista tm and catapult c synthesis electronic system level design tools  allows a single model to be taken from design concept to implementation 
we believe that the development and commercialization of eda software tools is generally a multi year process with limited customer adoption in the first years of tool availability 
once tools are adopted  however  their life spans tend to be long 
critical accounting policies we base our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current facts  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue  costs  and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the accounting for revenue recognition  valuation of trade accounts receivable  valuation of deferred tax assets  income tax reserves  goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  special charges  and accounting for stock based compensation are the critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements
