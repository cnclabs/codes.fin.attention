item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended november   october  and october  overview the company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers  and manufacturers of fpds 
photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other higher performance electronic products such as photonics  micro electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications 
thus  the company s selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications  particularly as it relates to the semiconductor industry s migration to more advanced design methodologies and fabrication processes 
the company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products produced using photomask technologies 
consequently  an increase in semiconductor or fpd sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales 
in addition  the reduced use of customized ics  reductions in design complexity  other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing semiconductors  or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or fpd designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors and fpds increases 
advances in semiconductor and photomask design and semiconductor production methods could reduce the demand for photomasks 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the semiconductor industry began to experience a downturn in fiscal  which the company believes could continue through fiscal  which had an adverse impact on its operating results 
the global semiconductor industry is driven by end markets which have been closely tied to consumer driven applications of high performance semiconductor devices including  but not limited to  communications and mobile computing solutions 
the company is typically required to fulfill its customer orders within a short period of time  sometimes within hours 
this results in the company having a minimal level of back log orders  typically one to two weeks 
the company cannot predict the timing of the industry s transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy  but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future  beneficially and adversely affecting its business  financial condition and operating results in the near term 
the company s ability to remain successful in these environments is based upon achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader  an efficient solutions supplier  and a company able to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure 
the effects of the worsening global economy and the tightening credit market are also making it increasingly difficult for the company to obtain external sources of financing to fund its operations 
the company faces challenges in the current and near term that require it to continue to make significant improvements in its competitiveness 
the company continues to evaluate financing alternatives  delay capital expenditures and evaluate further cost reduction initiatives 
the company is focused on improving its competiveness by advancing its technology and reducing costs 
in addition  the company increased its high end manufacturing capability in with the commencement of production at its state of the art nanofab facility us nanofab in boise  idaho 
to reduce costs  in the first quarter of fiscal the company implemented a restructure initiative in europe to reduce manufacturing and overhead costs  and reduce its workforce 
as of december  state of the art production for semiconductor masks is considered to be nanometer and lower for ics  and generation and above process technologies for fpds  while nanometer has moved into volume production 
nanometer and above geometries and generation and below process technologies for fpds constitute the majority of designs being fabricated in volume today 
the company expects there to be an increase in nanometer designs moving to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business through investments in manufacturing processes and technology in the global regions where its customers are located 
the photomask industry has been  and is expected to continue to be  characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to continually anticipate  respond to  and utilize changing technologies 
in particular  the company believes that  as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller  it will be required to manufacture even more complex optically enhanced reticles  including optical proximity correction and phase shift photomasks 
additionally  demand for photomasks has been  and could in the future be  adversely affected by changes in methods of semiconductor manufacturing which could affect the type or quantity of photomasks utilized  such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application specific ics 
through fiscal  the company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of alternative semiconductor design methodologies 
additionally  increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers  such as direct write lithography  could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks 
through fiscal  direct write lithography has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks  as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production 
however  should direct write or any other alternative methods of transferring ic designs to semiconductor wafers be done without the use of photomasks  the company s business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if the company is unable to anticipate  respond to  or utilize these or other changing technologies due to resource  technological or other constraints  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities but generally command higher average selling prices asps 
the company s capital expenditure payments for new facilities and equipment aggregated approximately million for the three fiscal years ended november   resulting in significant increases in operating expenses 
while the company intends to continue to make the required investments to support the technological demands of its customers and position itself for future growth  it expects that its level of capital expenditures will decrease for the next several years 
in  the company invested million in the mp mask joint venture  and technology license and related agreements 
the manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ics and other related products built using comparable photomask based process technologies has been  and continues to be  capital intensive due to the need to maintain a technology based infrastructure 
the company s integrated global manufacturing network and employees  which consist of ten current manufacturing sites the manchester  united kingdom facility ceased production in january  represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base 
should sales volumes decrease based upon the flow of design releases from the company s customers  the company may have excess or underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins  or result in write offs from asset impairments 
the vast majority of photomask units produced for the semiconductor industry employ geometries of nanometers or larger for ics  and generation technologies or lower for fpds 
at these geometries  the company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the company s competitors that is not available to the company 
semiconductor fabrication also occurs below nanometer for ics  and generation and above for fpds 
the company is currently capable of producing a selective range of photomasks at these smaller geometries  and has begun accelerating its efforts to support the development and production of photomasks for  and nanometer technology nodes in semiconductors and generation in fpd 
however  as is typical of industries in the midst of technological change  some of the company s competitors may be able to achieve higher manufacturing yields than the company when producing these smaller geometry photomasks  in part because these competitors may have completed more cycles of learning than the company in this area and in part because of the company s need to replicate production of these complex photomasks at its world wide advanced technology locations 
in march of  the company further streamlined its operating infrastructure in north america by closing the austin  texas manufacturing and research and development center and relocating certain development and manufacturing work to other facilities within the global network 
the company incurred total restructuring charges of million in its fiscal year ended october  in january  the company sold its austin  texas manufacturing and research and development facility for proceeds of million and realized a gain of million 
on may   photronics and micron entered into the mp mask joint venture  which develops and produces photomasks for leading edge and advanced next generation semiconductors 
as part of the formation of the joint venture  micron contributed its existing photomask technology center located at its boise  idaho  headquarters to mp mask and photronics paid micron million in exchange for a interest in mp mask and a license for photomask technology of micron and certain supply agreements 
the company subsequently invested an additional million in mp mask for capital expenditure and working capital purposes  and received a return of investment from mp mask of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  a capital lease agreement commenced with micron for the us nanofab for a total cost of million 
the company s total investment through fiscal in the purchase and equipping of its us nanofab was approximately million 
the us nanofab began production during the second quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges for certain of its long lived assets and wrote off all million of its goodwill see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced its intention to cease the manufacture of photomasks at its manchester  united kingdom facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table represents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended november  october  october  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses impairment of goodwill impairment of long lived assets consolidation  restructuring and related charges gain on sale of facility operating income loss interest expense investment and other income  net income loss before income tax benefit provision and minority interest income tax benefit provision minority interest net income loss note all the following tabular comparisons  unless otherwise indicated  are for the fiscal years ended november   october  and october   in millions of dollars 
net sales percent change to to fpd ic total net sales net sales for increased to million as compared to million for the increase is related to increased sales of fpd photomasks of million  primarily related to increased sales of high end fpd photomasks  substantially offset by reduced sales of ic photomasks of million associated with decreased asps  primarily for mainstream photomasks 
high end photomask applications  which typically have higher asps  include photomask sets for fpd products using g and above technologies and ic products using nanometer and below technologies 
during  sales of high end photomasks totaled million as compared to million in total sales of high end fpd photomasks increased by million  and sales of high end ic photomasks increased by million 
by geographic area  net sales in as compared to increased by million or in asia  decreased by million or in north america  and decreased by million or in europe 
as a percent of total sales in  sales were in asia  in north america and in europe 
net sales for decreased to million as compared to million for the decrease is related to reducedsales of fpd photomasks of million associated with decreased asps primarily for high end fpd photomasks  and reduced sales of ic photomasks of million as a result of a decline in asps  primarily from mainstream products 
during  sales of high end photomasks totaled million as compared to million in total sales of high end fpd masks decreased by million  while sales of high end ic photomasks increased by million 
by geographic area  net sales in as compared to decreased by million or in asia  by million or in north america  and by million or in europe 
as a percent of total sales in  sales were in asia  in north america  and in europe 
gross margin percent change to to gross margin gross margin gross margin decreased to in from in primarily due to costs relating to the company s increased manufacturing base  including costs associated with the us nanofab which commenced operations in the second fiscal quarter of  and reduced asps for ic photomasks  principally mainstream 
the decreased gross margin was partially mitigated by increased high end revenues  primarily for fpd photomasks 
the company operates in a high fixed cost environment and to the extent that the company s revenues and utilization increase or decrease  gross margin will be positively or negatively impacted 
the gross margin percentage in fiscal could be negatively impacted by decreased asps and units  and increased depreciation expense and costs associated with the company s increased fixed cost manufacturing base 
gross margin decreased to in from in primarily due to decreased asps for both ic and fpd photomasks and the company s increased manufacturing base in asia 
selling  general and administrative expenses percent change to to s  g a expense of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million in  as compared to million in the decrease was related to certain us nanofab costs reported in costs of sales since production commenced in the second quarter of fiscal  and reduced compensation expense  due in part to reduced headcount and cost reduction programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased compensation expense  which was partially offset by start up expenses related to the us nanofab 
research and development percent change to to r d expense of net sales research and development expenditures consist primarily of global development efforts of high end process technologies for advanced sub wavelength reticle solutions for ic and fpd technologies 
research and development expenses decreased in both and as compared to as a result of cost savings associated with the closure of the company s austin  texas research and development operations  which were in part offset by amortization expenses of the fair value of the agreement to license technology from micron 
impairment of goodwill through the third quarter of fiscal  the company experienced a sustained  significant decline in its stock price 
as a result of the decline in stock price  the company s market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of its consolidated net assets during the third quarter of fiscal due to the decrease in its market capitalization and quarterly net losses incurred through the third quarter of fiscal  management tested goodwill for impairment in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the results of the analysis indicated that there would be no remaining implied value attributable to the company s goodwill and  accordingly  the company wrote off all million of its goodwill in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets as a result of the company s projected undiscounted future cash flows related to certain of its asset groups located in europe and asia being less than the carrying value of those assets  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets the carrying value of the assets determined to be impaired were reduced to their fair values see note to the consolidated financial statement 
consolidation  restructuring and related charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company announced its intention to streamline its european operations by ceasing the manufacturing of photomasks at its facility in manchester  united kingdom 
the company expects to record an after tax charge in the range of million to million through fiscal including million after tax recorded in fiscal  approximately of which will be for non cash items 
the company expects to recover all related charges within a one year period through lower operating costs and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
the company estimates that approximately employees will be affected by the planned closure 
production ceased at the manchester  united kingdom facility in january in the second quarter of  the company streamlined its operating infrastructure in north america by ceasing the manufacture and research and development of photomasks at its austin  texas facility 
the company recorded total restructuring charges of million in  primarily comprised of million related to the impairment of facilities and equipment and million relating to workforce reductions of approximately employees in the united states 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy as its sales volume continues to grow in asia 
this ongoing assessment could result  in the future  in facilities closures  asset redeployment  workforce reductions  and the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be predicated by market conditions and customer requirements 
gain on sale of facility in january  the company sold its austin  texas manufacturing and research and development facility for proceeds of million and realized a gain of million 
other income expense interest expense investment and other income  net total other income expense interest expense increased in as compared to  primarily as a result of increased interest rates and increased outstanding debt balances 
investment and other income net  decreased in as compared to  primarily due to reduced interest income associated with lower cash and investment balances  which were offset by increased foreign currency gains 
interest expense decreased in as compared to  primarily as a result of the company s repaying the remaining outstanding balance of its million  convertible subordinated notes upon maturity on december  investment and other income net  for  decreased as compared to  primarily due to reduced foreign currency gains and reduced investment income associated with reduced investment balances 
further  realized gains on the sales of investments and other assets were million in as compared to million in income tax benefit provision income tax benefit provision effective income tax rate the company s operations have followed the recent migration of semiconductor industry fabrication to asia  where the company operates in countries where it is accorded favorable tax treatments 
pklt  the company s fpd manufacturing facility in taiwan  is accorded a tax holiday which expires in december in addition  the company has been accorded a tax holiday in china which is expected to expire in in korea  various investment tax credits have been utilized to reduce the company s effective income tax rate 
the company s tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of ongoing and future examinations and has provided accruals for tax contingencies in accordance with fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas the income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended november  was million or of loss before income taxes 
the income tax benefit differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory income tax rate of to the company s loss before income taxes  primarily due to the company s inability to record a full income tax benefit for the impairments of the goodwill and long lived assets  additional valuation allowances in taxable jurisdictions and available tax credits in korea 
the income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended october  was million or of income before income taxes  which differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily as a result of a recognized tax benefit of million and to a lesser extent available tax credits in korea 
during the fiscal year ended october   the company recorded a tax benefit in the amount of million related to the resolution and settlement of us and foreign tax matters that were associated with certain tax positions in prior years 
the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
the valuation allowance increased million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the availability of tax holidays in some asian jurisdictions did not have a significant impact on the company s decision to close some of its north american facilities nor in the company s increased asian presence which is in response to fundamental changes taking place in the semiconductor industry that the company serves 
these tax holidays had no dollar or per share effect on the  or fiscal years 
as semiconductor fabrication has migrated to asia  in large part from the united states  the company has followed  in order to avoid a severe loss of business 
in june  the fasb issued fin  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company adopted fin as of the beginning of its fiscal year 
prior to adoption  the company s pre existing policy was to establish reserves  including interest and penalties  for uncertain tax positions that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
as of the date of adoption of fin  the company has elected to recognize interest  and penalties if applicable  related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision in its condensed consolidated statements of operations 
as compared to the company s historical approach  the application of fin resulted in a net increase to accrued income taxes payable of approximately million including interest and penalties of approximately million  and a decrease to retained earnings of the same amount 
there were no significant changes to the liability for uncertain tax positions during the fiscal year ended november  minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries  which represents the minority interest in earnings of the company s non wholly owned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea  was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in minority interest expense is due to decreased net income of the company s non wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan 
the company s ownership in its subsidiary in korea was at november   october  and october  the company s ownership in its subsidiary in taiwan was at november   october  and october  the company increased its ownership in its subsidiary in korea from to during fiscal for cash of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources november  october  october  in millions in millions in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments total net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities as of november  the company had cash and equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million as of october  the company s working capital decreased million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease was primarily related to a decrease in cash and short term investments used for capital expenditure payments and to an increase in the current portion of outstanding long term borrowings due primarily to capital lease obligations 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a net loss incurred in fiscal as compared to net income in fiscal  and lower year over year accounts payable and accrued liability balances 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to lower accounts receivable balances associated with decreased sales as well as increases in accounts payable partially offset by decreased accrued liabilities 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal increased to million  as compared to million in  primarily due to proceeds from the sale of short term investments decreased year over year by million 
capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditure payments for fiscal to be approximately million to million  primarily related to investment in high end ic manufacturing capability 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal decreased to million  as compared to million in  primarily as a result of the initial payment of million to micron for the investment in mp mask and related technology license and supply agreements having been made in fiscal and a decrease in the purchase of short term investments from million in to million in cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million in fiscal cash used in financing activities in was primarily related to the company s redemptions of its million outstanding convertible subordinated notes on april   offset in part by million net borrowings on its revolver 
cash used in financing activities in was primarily related to the company s redeeming its million outstanding convertible subordinated notes in december on june   the company and a group of financial institutions entered into a credit agreement  which allows for borrowings under various currencies 
on october   the company s credit agreement was amended to change the minimum senior leverage ratio covenant  as defined  and to extend the date it was required to obtain at least million in permanent long term capital from november  to december  the credit agreement was further amended on december  to extend the date to obtain at least million in permanent long term capital to december   at which date the credit agreement was last amended and  among other items  eliminated the requirement to obtain such permanent long term capital 
the credit agreement was last amended on december  among other items  the last amendment provided for the following the maturity date of the credit agreement was changed from june  to july   the aggregate commitment was reduced from million to million  and is further reduced to million on october  and million on january   substantially all of the company s assets in the united states were pledged as collateral  financial covenants were modified and include  among other items as defined  a senior leverage ratio  total leverage ratio  minimum fixed charge ratio  and a quarterly minimum ebitda covenant  as defined 
additionally  cash received as a result of certain events  as defined  is required to be used to pay down the outstanding loan balance and reduce the available credit facility by the same amount  and there is a capital expenditure payment limitation 
the credit agreement also continues to provide for minimum unrestricted cash balances of million  as defined  and limits the amount of both secured and unsecured debt 
the credit facility is also secured by a pledge of the company s stock in certain of its subsidiaries 
as of november   million was outstanding under the credit facility  million was utilized for a standby letter of credit  and the remaining balance of million was available to the company based upon the subsequently amended aggregate commitment of million 
in addition to the credit agreement discussed above  on december   the maturity date of the foreign revolving loan and term loan was amended from october  to january  further  the interest rate on these foreign loans was amended and is currently based on the peoples bank of china base rate  plus a spread as defined  and the lenders have the right to secure the company s assets in china 
the company s liquidity is highly dependent on its ability to receive orders as it operates in a high fixed cost environment and the timing of capital expenditures  both of which can vary significantly from period to period 
depending on conditions in the ic semiconductor and fpd market  the company s cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash and investments may not be adequate to meet the company s current and long term needs for capital expenditures and operations 
historically  in certain years the company has used external financing to fund these needs 
due to conditions in the credit markets  some financing instruments used by the company in the past are currently not available to the company 
the company is evaluating financing alternatives  delaying capital expenditures and evaluating further cost reduction initiatives 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms should the company s capital requirements exceed cash available from operations and existing cash  short term investments and cash available under its credit facility 
at november   the company had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately million  which include approximately million related to capital expenditures  primarily related to investment in high end ic manufacturing capability 
the company will use its working capital and cash generated from operations to finance its capital expenditures 
cash requirements the company s cash requirements in fiscal will be primarily to fund operations  including capital spending and debt service 
the company believes that its cash on hand  cash generated from operations and amounts available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next months 
the company regularly reviews the availability and terms on which it might issue additional equity or debt securities in the public or private markets 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms should the company s capital requirements exceed cash available from operations and existing cash  short term investments and cash available under its credit facility 
contractual cash obligations the following table quantifies the company s future contractual obligations as of november  payments due total less than year years years more than years long term borrowings operating leases capital leases unconditional purchase obligations interest total as of november   the company had fin liabilities of million which were not included in the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments relating to such liabilities  and it was not practical to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period when such liabilities might be paid 
off balance sheet arrangements under the operating agreement relating to the mp mask joint venture  through may   the company may be required to make additional capital contributions to the joint venture of up to a maximum amount as defined in the operating agreement 
through the end of fiscal year  the company has contributed million to the joint venture  and has received a distribution from the joint venture of million 
stock based compensation total stock based compensation expense for the year ended november  was million  as compared to million for the year ended october   substantially all of which is in selling  general and administrative expenses 
no compensation cost was capitalized as part of inventory  and no income tax benefit has been recorded 
as of november   total unrecognized compensation cost of million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average amortization period of years 
business outlook a majority of the company s revenue growth has come from  and is expected to continue to come from  the asian region as customers increase their use of manufacturing foundries located outside of north america and europe 
additional revenue growth is also anticipated from north america and europe as a result of utilizing technology licensed under the company s technology license with micron 
the company s korean and taiwanese operations are non wholly owned subsidiaries  therefore a portion of earnings generated at each location is allocated to the minority shareholders 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy and monitor its market capitalization  sales volume and related cash flows from operations 
this ongoing assessment could result in future facilities closures  asset redeployments  additional impairments of intangible or long lived assets  workforce reductions  or the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be based on market conditions and customer requirements 
the company s future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained in this filing involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
while various risks and uncertainties have been discussed  a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
application of critical accounting procedures the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant accounting estimates include those used in the testing of long lived assets and goodwill for potential impairment  and those used in developing income tax provisions  allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory valuation allowances  and restructuring reserves 
the company s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time and different reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
changes in accounting estimates used are likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results reported by the company may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews these estimates periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period in which they are determined 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company records derivatives in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the condensed consolidated statements of income or as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
among other criteria  in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be a hedge for an interest rate  price  foreign currency exchange rate  or credit risk  expected to be highly effective at the inception of the hedge and be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge  and formally documented at the inception of the hedge 
the company uses judgment in assessing the fair value of derivatives and related financial instruments  including assumptions utilized in derivative fair value models in areas such as projected interest and foreign currency exchange rates during the contract term 
at times  the company manages a portion of its foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks through these derivative instruments 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment  except as explained below under impairment of long lived assets  are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
repairs and maintenance  as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature are charged to operations as incurred  while those which improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized 
upon sale or other disposition  the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  machinery and equipment over to years and furniture  fixtures and office equipment over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is less 
judgment and assumptions are used in establishing estimated useful lives and depreciation periods 
the company also uses judgment and assumptions as it periodically reviews property  plant and equipment for any potential impairment in carrying values whenever events such as a significant industry downturn  plant closures  technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
fair value amounts used in these analyses represent management s best estimate of fair values 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of a technology license agreement  a supply agreement  acquisition related intangibles  and prior to july   goodwill 
these assets  except as explained below  are stated at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis or another method that more fairly represents the utilization of the assets 
the future economic benefit of the carrying values of intangible assets that are subject to amortization are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based on discounted cash flows or market factors and an impairment loss would be recorded in the period so determined 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company tests goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
for purposes of testing impairment under sfas no 
 the company is a single reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference 
in performing the goodwill assessment  the company uses current market capitalization  discounted cash flows and other factors as the best evidence of fair value 
there are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in an analysis of goodwill impairment see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
the carrying values of the assets determined to be impaired are reduced to their estimated fair values 
the fair values of the impaired assets are determined based on market conditions  the income approach which utilizes cash flow projections  and other factors see note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment in joint venture investments in joint ventures over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence and that  in general  are at least percent owned are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income loss of the joint venture 
these investments are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the requirements of accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
an impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in the value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in judging other than temporary  the company would consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investment  the near term and longer term operating and financial prospects of the investee  and the company s longer term intent of retaining the investment in the investee 
income taxes the income tax provision benefit is computed on the basis of the various tax jurisdictions financial statements income or loss before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company uses judgment and assumptions to determine if valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets are required if realization is not likely by considering future market growth  forecasted operations  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company considers income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its effective income tax rate 
current income tax exposure is identified and temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and financial reporting purposes are assessed 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred income tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
accordingly  the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
significant management estimates and judgment are required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company uses judgment when estimating the effect on revenue of discounts and product warranty obligations  both of which are accrued when the related revenue is recognized 
product returns customer returns have historically been insignificant 
however  the company does record a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated sales returns based upon historical experience 
warranties and other post shipment obligations for a day period  the company warrants that items sold will conform to customer specification 
however  the company s liability is limited to repair or replacement of the photomasks at its sole option 
the company inspects photomasks for conformity to customer specifications prior to shipment 
accordingly  customer returns of items under warranty have historically been insignificant 
however  the company records a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated warranty returns based on historical experience 
the company s specific return policies include accepting returns for products with defects  or products that have not been produced to precise customer specifications 
at the time of revenue recognition  a liability is established for these items 
sales taxes the company presents it revenues in the consolidated statements of operations net of sales taxes  if any excluded from revenues 
stock based compensation the company adopted sfas no 
r share based payment on october   using the modified prospective method 
subsequently  compensation expense is recognized in the company s consolidated statements of income  over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
the company recognizes expense for all stock based compensation with graded vesting granted on or after october  on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
for awards with graded vesting granted prior to october   the company continues to recognize compensation cost over the vesting period following accelerated recognition as if each underlying vesting date represented a separate award 
stock based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
the company adopted the alternative transition method provided in fasb staff position no 
r for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on october   the company s income before income taxes and net income for the year ended october  was million  or per basic and diluted share less than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
there was no change in the statement of cash flows as a result of adoption of sfas no 
r 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
the company estimates stock price volatility based on weekly averages of its historical volatility over a term approximately equal to the grant s estimated option life 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company records derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the company does not engage in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the condensed consolidated statement of operations  or as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  among other criteria  the derivative must be a hedge for an interest rate  price  foreign currency exchange rate  or credit risk  expected to be highly effective at the inception of the hedge and be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item during the term of the hedge  and formally documented at the inception of the hedge 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future cash flows caused by movements in foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of  and during the term of each hedge 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations and is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates of such currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company s sales  operating margins and retained earnings 
the functional currencies of the company s asian subsidiaries are the korean won  new taiwan dollar  chinese renminbi  and singapore dollar 
the functional currencies of the company s european subsidiaries are the british pound and the euro 
the company attempts to minimize its risk of foreign currency transaction losses by producing its products in the same country in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency  and by managing its working capital 
in some instances  the company may sell or purchase products in a currency other than the functional currency of the country where it was produced 
there can be no assurance that this approach will continue to be successful  especially in the event of a significant adverse movement in the value of any foreign currencies against the us dollar 
for the past several years the company has not experienced a significant foreign exchange loss on these transactions in its statement of operations 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
the company s primary net foreign currency exposures as of november  included the korean won  the japanese yen  the singapore dollar  the new taiwan dollar  the chinese renminbi  the british pound  and the euro 
as of november   a adverse movement in the value of these currencies against the us dollar would have resulted in a net unrealized pre tax loss of million 
the company does not believe that a change in the exchange rates of other non us dollar currencies would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in april   the company s korean subsidiary entered into a foreign currency rate swap contract which  under the terms of the contract  effectively converted a million interest bearing intercompany loan denominated in us dollars to korean won 
the intercompany loan was repaid and related swap settled during the nine month period ended july   including a final payment of million during the three month period ended july  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at their inception as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness 
in september   the company entered into forward contracts to convert the fixed yen purchase price of certain equipment into fixed us dollar amounts  which were designated as cash flow hedges 
the company records these derivative instruments in either current assets  noncurrent assets  or accrued liabilities  depending on their net position  at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings for the ineffective portion of hedges  or in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss for the effective portion 
as of november   all of the company s forward contracts were settled 
in april  the company s korean and taiwanese subsidiaries each entered into separate foreign currency exchange rate swap contracts that effectively converted a million interest bearing intercompany loan denominated in us dollars into their respective local currencies 
both contracts expire in conjunction with the april maturity date of the intercompany loan 
the company did not elect to designate either contract as a fair value hedge 
interest rate risk the majority of the company s borrowings at november  was in the form of borrowings under the company s credit facility  last amended on december   and certain foreign loans payable with variable interest rates 
the million net carrying value of its convertible subordinated note was repaid by the company in december at november  and october   the company had approximately million and million  respectively  in net variable rate financial instruments which were sensitive to interest rate risk 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in either or
