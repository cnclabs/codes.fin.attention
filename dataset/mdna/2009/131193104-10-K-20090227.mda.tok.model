item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  sales and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available 
management believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as products are shipped to customers  net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs 
the company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
in addition  from time to time  the company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns 
the company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program as well as historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
historically  the company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns 
however  if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
for example  assuming there had been a increase in the company s sales returns  pre tax income for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings 
sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program  management s forecast of future product demand  and historical customer participation in similar programs 
the company s primary sales program  the preferred retailer program  offers longer payment terms during the initial sell in period  as well as potential rebates and discounts  for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the company  including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels  prime product placement and retailer staff training 
under this program  qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased 
discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale 
for rebates  the company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases 
the estimate is based on the historical level of purchases  adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels 
the estimated year end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels  as necessary 
the preferred retailer program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year end 
in addition to the 
table of contents preferred retailer program  the company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature 
historically the company s actual costs related to its preferred retailer program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates 
revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws 
the company s gift cards have no expiration 
to determine when redemption is remote  the company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used and compares that information with historical redemption trends 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues 
however  if the company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
the deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards increased million to million during the year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends  all of which are subject to change 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts  pre tax income for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels  sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand  all of which are subject to change 
the calculation of the company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted consumer demand and pricing  regulatory usga and r a rule changes  the promotional environment and technological obsolescence 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  the company may need to increase its inventory allowance  which could significantly adversely affect the company s operating results 
for example  assuming there had been a increase in the company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory  pre tax income for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
historically  there have been no material inventory write offs for which an allowance had not previously been established 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  investments  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the discounted future cash flows estimated to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
determining 
table of contents whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  the timing of the impairment test  and the asset s residual value  if any 
the company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when applying these impairment rules 
to determine fair value  the company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate  quoted market prices  royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
warranty policy the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs  although the company s historical practice has been to honor warranty claims well after the two year stated warranty period 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
the company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period  where little or no claims experience may exist 
experience has shown that warranty rates can vary between product models 
therefore  the company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long term historical warranty rates until sufficient data is available 
as actual model specific rates become available  the company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
historically  the company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation 
however  if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
assuming there had been a increase in the company s warranty obligation  pre tax income for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
income taxes current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
effective january   the company was required to adopt and implement the provisions of interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

table of contents fin  which requires the company to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the company would be required to pay such additional taxes 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than likelihood of being sustained 
the company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the united states and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions 
the preparation of these income tax returns requires the company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions  which could affect the amount of tax paid by the company 
the company  in consultation with its tax advisors  bases its income tax returns on interpretations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the income tax returns  however  are subject to routine audits by the various federal  state and international taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company files its income tax returns 
as part of these reviews  a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the tax positions taken by the company 
the resolution of any disagreements over the company s tax positions often involves complex issues and may span multiple years  particularly if litigation is involved 
the ultimate resolution of these tax positions is often uncertain until the audit is complete and any disagreements are resolved 
as required under applicable accounting rules  the company therefore accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability  including interest and penalties  for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  completion of tax audits  expiration of statute of limitations  or upon occurrence of other events 
historically  additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the company s expectations

sfas no 
r further requires a reduction in share based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate used by the company is based on historical forfeiture trends 
if actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the company s estimates  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the company s expected stock price volatility  the expected dividend yield  the expected life of an option and the risk free rate  which is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
the company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected dividend yield and the expected option life 
changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units collectively restricted stock based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of shares underlying the restricted stock awarded 
compensation expense related to unvested shares is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate 
during the company granted performance units to certain employees under the company s equity incentive plan 
performance units are a form of share based award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the company s performance against specified performance targets over a three year period 
the estimated fair value of the performance units is determined based on the closing price of the 
table of contents company s common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares to be issued at the end of the performance period 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the performance period  reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate 
the company uses forecasted performance metrics to estimate the number of shares that will ultimately be issued 
if actual results are not consistent with the company s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the forecasted metrics  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to its results of operations

table of contents results of operations overview of business and seasonality the company designs  manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs and golf balls and also sells golf and lifestyle apparel  golf footwear  golf bags  gloves  eyewear and other golf related accessories 
the company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year 
the company s products are designed for golfers of all skill levels  both amateur and professional 
the company has two operating segments that are organized on the basis of products  namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment 
the golf clubs segment consists primarily of callaway golf  top flite and ben hogan woods  hybrids  irons  wedges and putters as well as odyssey putters 
this segment also includes other golf related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre owned golf clubs 
the golf balls segment consists primarily of callaway golf and top flite golf balls 
as discussed in note segment information to the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income expense not utilized by management in determining segment profitability 
while the company s golf clubs segment has been profitable  the company s golf balls segment has historically reported annual operating losses for all periods until the company s golf balls segment results of operations have improved significantly from a loss of million for the year ended december  including charges of million for top flite integration initiatives to profitability of million for the year ended december  including charges of million related to the gross margin improvement initiatives 
the company is continuing to take actions to improve the profitability of its golf ball business  including the consolidation of its golf ball production operations into other existing locations 
as a result of this consolidation  the company announced the closure of its ball manufacturing facility in gloversville  new york in may in most of the company s key markets  the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis 
weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year round  except in a few markets  with many of the company s on course customers closing for the cold weather months 
the company s business is therefore also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in general  during the first quarter  the company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season 
this initial sell in generally continues into the second quarter 
the company s second quarter sales are also significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter 
the company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season 
the company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the company s key markets 
however  fourth quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year 
this seasonality  and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations  can be affected by many factors  including the timing of new product introductions 
in general  however  because of this seasonality  a majority of the company s sales and most  if not all  of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year 
approximately half of the company s business is conducted outside of the united states and is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
for reporting purposes  transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into us dollars based upon applicable foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in foreign currency rates therefore can have a significant effect on the company s reported financial results 
in general  the company s financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business 
the company s hedging activities can mitigate but do not eliminate the effects of the foreign currency fluctuations 
overall  during  the company s reported financial results generally benefited from foreign currency rates 
during the second half of the year  however  the us dollar began to strengthen and the translation of foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on the company s third and fourth quarter results 
if the dollar continues to strengthen as compared to the currencies in which the company conducts business  the company s future reported financial results would be significantly adversely affected 

table of contents executive summary the company had record sales and earnings during the first half of these record results reflect the strength of the company s brands  progress on the company s gross margin improvement initiatives and the company s international business  which was able to more than offset the deteriorating economic conditions in the united states during the first half of during the second half of  however  the deteriorating economic conditions began to spread to most of the company s international markets and the economic conditions in the united states worsened 
the recessionary conditions experienced during the second half of had a significant adverse effect on consumer and retailer confidence  which exacerbated the normal end of season sales slowdown and resulted in a million decline in net sales for compared to the deteriorating global economic conditions also had an adverse effect on the company s gross profit for given the uncertain economic conditions during the second half of  consumers trended toward lower priced products and the company reduced prices of certain older model products  which overall resulted in a decrease in average selling prices during the second half of as compared to the comparable period in the prior year 
the impact of the decrease of average selling prices on gross profit was offset by the company s continued successful implementation of its gross margin improvement initiatives as well as the positive impact of foreign currency rates 
as a result  the company s gross profit remained flat at for compared to operating expenses for were essentially flat with despite inflationary pressures 
the business process improvements implemented by the company over the past several years have increased the company s flexibility to respond more quickly to changing market conditions 
the company was able to take advantage of its increased flexibility and reduce its planned operating expenses as net sales declined 
in addition  despite a rapid decline in reorders during the latter part of  the company was able to finish the year with inventory as a percentage of trailing months net sales at  which is consistent with the prior year 
despite the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company s results  the company was able to increase fully diluted earnings per share for to as compared to fully diluted earnings per share of for the company s results for include a non cash  non operational benefit of per share related to the one time reversal of a non cash energy derivative valuation account that was established in associated with the termination of a long term energy supply contract 
the company s results also include for and cash and non cash charges related to the company s gross margin improvement initiatives of and per share  respectively 
although the macroeconomic environment will provide many challenges in the short term  management believes the company s business fundamentals remain strong and that the company is well positioned for the future 
the company is the leader or one of the leaders in every market in which it competes  the company has a strong balance sheet  and the company will continue to benefit from the many cost savings initiatives implemented over the past couple years 
the company intends to manage its costs and inventories prudently as dictated by the current economic environment 
the company  however  also intends to continue to invest in initiatives to prepare for long term growth once economic conditions stabilize 
management expects that the unfavorable global economic conditions experienced in the second half of will continue into management also expects that the unfavorable global economic conditions will have a negative impact upon not only customer orders but also consumer discretionary spending  which will negatively impact sell through and reorders of the company s products in management expects that sales of golf equipment in will be less than for the industry as a whole 
in addition  management believes that the turmoil in the foreign currency markets experienced in the second half of will continue into this can have a significant effect upon the company s reported financial results because approximately half of the company s sales occur outside of the united states in foreign 
table of contents currencies which must be translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
based upon current rates  management expects that  overall  the us dollar in will be much stronger than in relative to the foreign currencies in which the company conducts business  which would have a significant adverse effect upon the company s reported financial results in for example  if the company were to translate its financial results based upon applicable exchange rates in january as opposed to actual rates  the company s reported consolidated net sales would have been approximately million lower and reported consolidated earnings per share would have been approximately to lower 
investors should note that this example only demonstrates the effect of the translation of foreign currency under the assumptions used in this example and that the actual effect of the translation of foreign currency on results will depend upon many factors  including actual currency exchange rates during years ended december  and net sales decreased million to  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december  this decrease reflects a million decrease in net sales of the company s golf clubs segment partially offset by a million increase in net sales of the company s golf balls segment as set forth below dollars in millions years ended december  growth decline dollars percent net sales golf clubs golf balls for further discussion of each operating segment s results  see golf club and golf ball segments results below 
net sales information by region is summarized as follows dollars in millions years ended december  growth decline dollars percent net sales united states europe japan rest of asia other foreign countries net sales in the united states decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this decline was primarily due to reduced demand caused by a less favorable economic environment in the united states in the company s sales in regions outside of the united states increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase in international net sales was primarily attributable to an increase of million in japan  primarily due to continued strong sales of a region specific driver introduced in the increase in international net sales was positively affected by million of net favorable changes in foreign currency rates primarily in japan and other foreign countries 
the favorable fluctuations in foreign currency rates were partially offset by selective price reductions taken in certain regions during the first half of in response to the weakened us dollar

these decreases were partially offset by reductions in golf club component costs as a result of improved product design  and improved manufacturing efficiencies resulting from the company s gross margin improvement initiatives 
additionally  gross margins were positively affected by favorable changes in foreign currency rates during the year ended december  see segment profitability below for further discussion of gross margins 
gross profit for the year ended december  was negatively affected by charges of million related to the implementation of the company s gross margin improvement initiatives compared to million for the comparable period in the increase in gross margin improvement charges during the year ended december  is primarily due to costs associated with the consolidation of golf ball production operations into other existing locations  which resulted in the closure of the company s golf ball manufacturing facility in gloversville  new york during selling expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  selling expenses increased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to for the comparable period of the dollar increase in selling expense was primarily due to increases of million in marketing expenses  million in depreciation expense as a result of the current year purchase of displays and shelving fixtures  million in consulting costs to support brand awareness initiatives and million in travel and entertainment expenses 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in share based compensation expense related to non employees  and million in employee costs primarily as a result of decreases in employee incentive compensation expense and sales commissions 
additionally  the company s selling expenses were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non us selling expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses remained consistent at during the twelve months ended december  and the dollar decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases of million in employee costs resulting from decreases in employee incentive compensation expense and deferred compensation expense

golf clubs and golf balls segments results for the years ended december  and the company experienced an increase in net sales during the first half of primarily due to an increase in international sales as a result of strong demand for its current year product introductions and favorable changes in foreign currency rates 
this increase in sales internationally was partially offset by a decline in sales in the united states primarily due to reduced demand caused by a less favorable economic environment compared to the prior year

the sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of in foreign currencies to which the company was exposed at december  through its derivative financial instruments 
the estimated maximum one day loss from the company s foreign currency derivative financial instruments  calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above  is million at december  the portion of the estimated loss associated with the foreign exchange contracts that offset the remeasurement gain and loss of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities is million at december  and would impact earnings 
the company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur
