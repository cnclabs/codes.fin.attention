also during the three months ended december   the company wrote off million of development costs on development projects the company has determined it will not pursue 
in addition  the company recorded an million impairment charge to reduce its pro rata share of the carrying value of land held for development at a consolidated joint venture 
inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the consumer price index cpi 
in addition  about of the leases expire each year  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  historically the majority of the leases required the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
in january  the company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses  generally excluding property taxes  regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center 
this change shifts the burden of cost control to the company 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectible accounts  impairment of long lived assets  the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets  and estimates for environmental matters 
the company s significant accounting policies are described 
table of contents in more detail in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following policies are deemed to be critical 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the straight line rent adjustment 
currently  of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
percentage rents are recognized when the tenants specified sales targets have been met 
estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
property the company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment and development of properties in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited 
the company considers a construction project as completed and held available for occupancy and ceases capitalization of costs when the areas under development have been substantially completed 
maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
costs for major replacements and betterments  which includes hvac equipment  roofs  parking lots  etc  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings 
property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years tenant improvements years equipment and furnishings years accounting for acquisitions the company accounts for all acquisitions in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the company first determines the value of the land and buildings utilizing an as if vacant methodology 
the company then assigns a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition 
the balance of the purchase price is allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities 
tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms 
the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms 
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in place 
table of contents operating leases which come in three forms i leasing commissions and legal costs  which represent the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in place leases  such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the company s markets  ii value of in place leases  which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased  and iii above or below market value of in place leases  which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition  discounted for tenant credit risks 
leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms 
the value of in place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases 
above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities  depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market  and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases 
when the company acquires a real estate property  the company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions 
these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties 
asset impairment the company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such factors include the tenant s ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases 
the company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment 
such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center 
fair value of financial instruments on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions 
level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 

table of contents the company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments 
when the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value  no additional disclosure is made 
deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight line method 
costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
in place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of the renewal term 
leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the individual remaining lease years 
the ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows deferred lease costs years deferred financing costs years in place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal leasing commissions and legal costs years recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
r requires an acquiring entity to recognize acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a transaction at fair value as of the acquisition date and changes the accounting treatment for certain items  including acquisition costs  which will be required to be expensed as incurred 
sfas no 
requires that noncontrolling interests be presented as a component of consolidated stockholders equity and eliminates minority interest accounting such that the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests will be presented as part of consolidated net income on the consolidated statements of operations 
sfas no 
r and sfas no 
require concurrent adoption and are to be applied prospectively for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption of either standard is prohibited 
the company believes that these statements will not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
however  the company is currently evaluating whether the adoption of sfas no 
could have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
this new standard requires the initial proceeds from convertible debt that may be settled in cash to be bifurcated between a liability component and an equity component 
the objective of the guidance is to require the liability and equity components of convertible debt to be separately accounted for in a manner such that the interest expense recorded on the convertible debt would not equal the contractual rate of interest on the convertible debt  but instead would be recorded at a rate that would reflect the issuer s conventional non convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance 
this is accomplished through the creation of a discount on the debt that would be accreted using the effective interest method as additional non cash interest expense over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding 
the company is required to adopt fsp apb on january  this fsp will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
the company currently expects that fsp apb

paragraph a of sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both a indexed to the company s own stock and b classified in stockholders equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument 
eitf issue no 
provides a new two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock and thus able to qualify for the sfas no 
paragraph a scope exception 
eitf issue no 
will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after december   and early adoption is prohibited 
management is currently evaluating whether the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have an impact on the accounting for the senior notes and related capped call option transactions 
in the event that management determines that the adoption of eitf issue no 
impacts the accounting for the senior notes  management s current conclusion regarding the impact of fsp apb could change

funds from operations the company uses ffo in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers ffo and ffo diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to gaap measures 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis

this is especially true since ffo excludes real estate depreciation and amortization as the company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight line basis over time 
ffo on a fully diluted basis is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs
