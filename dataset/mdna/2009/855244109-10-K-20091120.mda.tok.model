item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general starbucks corporation s fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september the fiscal years ended on september   september  and september  all included weeks 
starbucks fiscal year will include weeks  with the rd week falling in its fourth fiscal quarter 
all references to store counts  including data for new store openings  are reported net of related store closures  unless otherwise noted 
overview fiscal was a challenging year for starbucks 
the company was confronted with extraordinary economic and operating challenges in addition to facing an increasingly competitive landscape 
although the global economy has shown some signs of improvement recently  management recognizes the difficult economic situation that many consumers are still facing and does not expect that to significantly change over the course of fiscal this challenging economic environment has strained consumer discretionary spending in the us and internationally  which in turn has impacted company revenues  comparable store sales  operating income and operating margins 
starbucks responded to this difficult environment with a more disciplined focus on operations and the introduction of initiatives to permanently improve the company s cost structure 
the result is an underlying business model that is less reliant on high revenue growth to drive profitability  and that still preserves the fundamental strengths and values of the starbucks brand 
the primary initiatives in this strategy include rationalizing the global company operated store portfolio  right sizing the non retail support organization  and reducing the company s cost structure  while renewing the focus on service excellence in the stores and delivering relevant innovation 
starbucks actions to rationalize its global store portfolio have included the planned closure of nearly  company operated stores globally 
at the end of fiscal  nearly all of the approximately us company operated stores  stores in australia and company operated stores in other international markets had been closed 
the remaining international store closures are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal initiatives targeting reductions in the company s cost structure in fiscal proceeded as planned  with full year costs of million removed from the company s cost structure 
these targeted cost reductions and associated operational efficiency efforts  along with a more profitable company operated store base  have moved starbucks toward a more sustainable business model  while preserving the fundamental strengths and values of the brand 
the operational efficiency efforts are primarily focused on store level execution and include improved staffing models and better management of waste in coffee  dairy and food 
starbucks actions to improve the customer experience have resulted in a more focused effort toward in store offerings  and simplifying the demands on store partners employees  while concurrently raising already high standards for beverage and food offerings  customer service and the overall in store experience 
the effects of these efforts have already been seen in the company s improved customer satisfaction scores 
starbucks has a renewed focus on relevant product innovation and the disciplined expansion and leveraging of its existing products and sales channels 
for example  starbucks via tm ready brew coffee was launched in fiscal and is designed to capture a significant share of both the billion global instant coffee category and the single serve market 
the company intends to drive sales within the retail store base and cpg channels  both in the us and internationally 
the company continues to maintain a solid financial foundation  with no short term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal and with cash and liquid investments totaling more than million 
this solid financial position and continued strong cash flow generation have provided starbucks with the financial flexibility to implement its restructuring efforts as well as make ongoing investments in its core business 
fiscal the view ahead for fiscal  the company expects revenues to grow in the low to mid single digits compared to fiscal  driven by modestly positive comparable store sales  a rd fiscal week  and approximately planned net new 
table of contents stores in the us and approximately net new stores in international markets 
both the us and international net new additions are expected to be primarily licensed stores 
given these revenue expectations  combined with the company s reduced cost structure  in store operating efficiencies  and lower restructuring charges  starbucks currently expects significant improvement in its consolidated operating margin in fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal is currently expected to reach approximately billion and capital expenditures are expected to range from million to million 
operating segment overview starbucks has three reportable operating segments us  international and cpg 
the us foodservice business  which was previously reported in the us segment  is now reported in the cpg segment  as a result of internal management realignments within the us and cpg businesses 
segment information for all prior periods presented has been revised to reflect this change 
the us and international segments both include company operated retail stores and licensed retail stores 
licensed stores frequently have a higher operating margin than company operated stores 
under the licensed model  starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues  but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee 
the international segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company operated compared to the us segment  however  the us segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of  and attachment to  the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base 
as a result  the more mature us segment has significantly more stores  and higher total revenues than the international segment 
average sales per store are also higher in the us due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels 
further  certain market costs  particularly occupancy costs  are lower in the us segment compared to the average for the international segment  which comprises a more diverse group of operations 
as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the us segment  the number of stores  the higher unit volumes  and the lower market costs  the us segment  despite its higher relative percentage of company operated stores  has a higher operating margin  excluding restructuring costs  than the less developed international segment 
the company s international store base continues to expand and starbucks has been focusing on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets  such as china  brazil and russia 
the company s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization  relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 
the cpg segment includes packaged coffee and tea  and other branded products operations worldwide  and the us foodservice business 
for the packaged coffee and tea and branded products  starbucks operates primarily through licensing arrangements and joint ventures with large consumer products business partners  most significantly with kraft for distribution of packaged coffees and teas  and the north american coffee partnership with the pepsi cola company for manufacturing and distribution of ready to drink beverages 
this operating model allows the cpg segment to leverage the business partners existing infrastructures and to extend the starbucks brand in an efficient way 
most of the customer revenues from the packaged coffee and ready to drink products are recognized as revenues by the licensed or joint venture business partner  not by the cpg segment 
royalties and payments from our licensing agreements are recorded under licensing revenue  and the proportionate share of the results of the company s joint ventures are included  on a net basis  in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings 
the us foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks 
the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues  a modest cost structure  and a resulting higher operating margin  compared to the company s other two reporting segments  which consist primarily of retail stores 
expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments 
these unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses  related depreciation and amortization expenses  corporate restructuring charges and amounts included in net interest income and other and interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings

consolidated results of operations in millions sep  sep  sep  sep  fiscal year ended change of total net revenues net revenues company operated retail specialty licensing foodservice and other total specialty total net revenues company operated retail revenues decreased from fiscal  primarily attributable to a decline in comparable store sales  comprised of a decline in transactions and a decline in the average value per transaction

the weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the us segment  with a comparable store sales decline of for the year 
the international segment experienced a decline in comparable store sales 
the company derived of total net revenues from channels outside the company operated retail stores  collectively known as specialty operations 
the decrease in foodservice and other revenue was primarily due to the softness in the hospitality industry

store operating expenses as a percentage of company operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to reduced headcount and spending in the regional support organization as a result of starbucks restructuring efforts  and the effect of initiatives to improve store labor efficiencies 
restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize the company s global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

sep  sep  sep  sep  fiscal year ended change of total net revenues operating income interest income and other  net nm interest expense earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings effective tax rate net interest income and other increased due primarily to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain balance sheet amounts 
also contributing to the increase were lower unrealized market value losses on the company s trading securities portfolio compared to fiscal as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the trading securities approximate a portion of the company s liability under its management deferred compensation plan mdcp 
the mdcp liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance  with this offsetting impact recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings 
interest expense decreased due to a lower average balance of short term 
table of contents borrowings and lower average short term borrowing rates in fiscal compared to the prior year 
at the end of fiscal  the company had no short term debt 
the relatively low effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for retroactive tax credits and an income tax credit related to the settlement of an employment tax audit in fiscal as a result of the audit settlement  approximately million of expense was recorded in store operating expenses  with an offsetting income tax credit and no impact to net earnings 
the effective tax rate for fiscal is expected to be in the range of to

this improvement was primarily due to operational changes designed to improve labor efficiency and reduce product waste in company operated stores  and to lower non store support costs 
partially offsetting the favorability were higher restructuring charges during the year 
the company incurred higher lease exit and related costs due to the higher number of actual store closures compared to the prior year period

the rating agency also affirmed the bbb corporate credit rating on the company and raised the short term rating to a from a to conform with the stable rating outlook 
as a result of the moody s p short term rating issued in may  commercial paper has become less liquid and more expensive than borrowing under the company s credit facility 
consequently  the company utilized its credit facility for almost all short term borrowing needs subsequent to may in the latter half of the year the company reduced its total short term borrowings to a zero balance due to strong operating cash flows and lower capital spending on new company operated stores 
management is unlikely to make significant use of its commercial paper program until its moody s short term ratings improve 
despite limited access to the commercial paper markets  management believes that cash flow from operations and its existing cash and liquid investments  supplemented as needed by the billion in short term borrowing capacity under the company s revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future  as well as to fund the cost of lease termination and related costs from the remaining international store closures

the company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees 
any decisions to increase its ownership interest in its equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with the company s ownership strategy and are likely to be infrequent

table of contents commodity prices  availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents the company s primary market risk  generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products  among other things 
the company purchases  roasts and sells high quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee 
in addition to coffee  the company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its company operated retail stores 
the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the company s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations

financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  equity security prices  and interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to various market based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy 
under this policy  market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies  such as entering into hedging transactions 
the umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings 
the company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk 
additionally  this policy restricts  among other things  the amount of market based risk the company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity 
in general  hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed 
the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 
commodity price risk the company purchases commodity inputs  including coffee  dairy products and diesel that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results 
in addition to fixed price contracts and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases  the company has entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges  as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  because a portion of the company s operations consists of activities outside of the us  the company has transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  british pound  euro  and japanese yen 
as a result  starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues  inventory purchases  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as of september   the company had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases 
in addition  starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in starbucks japan  as well as the company s net investments in its canada subsidiary  to minimize foreign currency exposure 
the company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives  but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie hedged items that would occur within the hedging period 
the following table summarizes the potential impact to the company s future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the

these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying equity prices of its investments as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments

please see note for further information 
available for sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available for sale securities 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its available for sale securities as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

table of contents starbucks considers its policies on asset impairment  stock based compensation  operating leases  self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
asset impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows  in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate carrying values exceed estimated fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the company s trademarks 
upon determination that the carrying values of such assets are in excess of their estimated fair values  the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges 
stock based compensation starbucks accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions  under which the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements 
changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation  however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term  management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal would not have been material 
operating leases starbucks leases retail stores  roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases 
the company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation aro expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term 
estimating aros involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs 
future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated 
in addition  the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of aro expense  as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent 
estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions  including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income 
the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate 
self insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks  including workers compensation  healthcare benefits  general liability  property insurance  and director and officers liability insurance 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

table of contents income taxes starbucks recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and accrues for uncertain tax positions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets 
accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments  including estimating the amount  timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement 
although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates
