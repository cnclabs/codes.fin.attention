prior to the acquisition and the operations of the acquired businesses from february   through december  the predecessor consolidated statements of income loss and consolidated statements of cash flows for the period of january through february   and for the years ended december  and  are presented for comparative purposes 
the period of february inception through december   represents the activities of aldabra acquisition corp

however  sales and most operating cost items are substantially consistent with those reported by the predecessor 
finished goods inventories were revalued to estimated selling prices less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit on the disposal 
depreciation changed as a result of adjustments to the fair values of property and equipment due to our purchase price allocation 
these items  along with changes in interest expense and income taxes  are explained independently where appropriate 
acquisition of boise cascade s paper and packaging operations on february   we acquired the paper  packaging  and most of the corporate and other segments of boise cascade for cash and securities 
we have four pulp and paper mills  one paper mill  five corrugated container plants  a corrugated sheet feeder plant  and two paper distribution facilities located in the united states 
our corporate headquarters office is in boise  idaho 
the acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations 
upon completion of the transaction  boise cascade owned million  or  of our outstanding shares 
subsequent to the transaction  boise cascade transferred the shares to its parent company  boise cascade holdings  llc 
table of contents the purchase price was paid with cash  the issuance of shares of our common stock  and a note payable 
these costs  including direct transaction costs and purchase price adjustments  are summarized as follows february  millions cash paid to boise cascade cash paid to boise cascade for financing and other fees less cash contributed by boise cascade net cash equity at average price per share lack of marketability discount total equity note payable to boise cascade at closing working capital adjustment total note payable to boise cascade fees and expenses total purchase price cash upon closing  we paid boise cascade  million in cash related to the base purchase price plus million incurred by boise cascade for transaction financing costs and fees 
immediately prior to the acquisition  boise cascade contributed million of cash to the acquired businesses 
equity the number of shares issued to boise cascade totaled  the equity price per share was calculated based on the average per share closing price of our common stock for the trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior to the consummation of the acquisition 
since that average price was below the floor provided in the purchase agreement  we determined a new measurement date in accordance with issue no 
of emerging issues task force eitf  determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination 
we calculated a average price per share based on two days before and after the acquisition measurement date  which was february  the value of stock consideration paid to boise cascade was reduced by a discount for lack of marketability dlom 
the valuation technique we employed to quantify the dlom used a protective put analysis 
this method is based on the idea that if one holds restricted or nonmarketable stock and purchases an option to sell those shares at market price  one has in effect purchased marketability for the shares 
the price of the put option as a percentage of the strike price is the discount for lack of marketability 
using a put option model to estimate a dlom is 
table of contents based on the theory that an investor would need to hedge his position in the underlying stock at a future price to protect his or her investment 
the dlom valuation used the following assumptions stock price and strike price the protective put analysis used a stock price and strike price input based on our quoted closing stock price of on the day preceding the discount valuation date  which represents a level input as outlined in sfas  fair value measurements 
since the dlom is measured as a percentage discount for an at the money put  the concluded discount percentage will be the same irrespective of the input price chosen 
time to expiration the protective put analysis assumed a four month time to expiration consistent with the four month limitations on registration 
this time period represents a level input 
risk free rate the analysis used the four month continuous risk free rate of based on the continuous rate interpolated between securities with three months and six months to maturity  as obtained from the federal reserve as of the valuation date 
this estimated risk free rate represents a level input 
volatility the volatility assumption was calculated based on the average of the one year historical volatility of the equity of publicly traded comparable companies in the company s industry  using daily stock price returns and current implied volatility of the comparable companies traded options  measured over two weeks prior to the valuation date 
the volatilities were relevered based on the company s capital structure 
the expected volatility assumption was calculated to be as of the valuation date 
this estimated volatility represents a level input 
using the above assumptions  the put option value was calculated to be 
the put option value as a percentage of the input stock price equals  which was deemed to be the appropriate dlom 
note payable in connection with the acquisition  boise inc issued a million subordinated promissory note to boise cascade 
after the acquisition  and pursuant to the purchase agreement  the note was amended to increase the amount payable to million effective february  the increase of the note reflects million of postclosing working capital adjustments in boise cascade s favor 
after the transaction  boise cascade transferred the note payable to its parent  boise cascade holdings  llc  and on june   boise cascade holdings  llc  sold the note payable to eight individual parties for million  including accrued interest but before transaction costs 
the full amount of the original note  as amended  together with accrued and unpaid interest from march   is now represented by eight separate notes payable  each with terms other than the amount identical to the original note payable 
because none of the eight holders of the notes are related to either boise inc or boise cascade  we no longer record the notes as related party notes payable on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note  transactions with related parties  and note  debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii
