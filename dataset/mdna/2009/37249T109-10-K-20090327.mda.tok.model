this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results and business plans discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in item a 
risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
our business activities we are engaged  through subsidiaries and joint ventures in which we are a participant  in the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
we initiated these activities in through december   our activities have been undertaken in locations where we and our joint venture participants have been granted exploration rights pursuant to pscs entered into with the government of india 
we have entered into ten pscs 
each psc relates to a separate drilling block onshore or offshore india and each provides for multi year and multi phase exploration and drilling activities 
exploration and development activities pursuant to the terms of these agreements are expected to continue throughout at december   we have not reported any proved reserves of oil or natural gas 
statements of operations oil and gas operations our oil and gas exploration activities commenced at august  we have not since our inception earned any revenues from these operations 
years ended december  and during the year ended december   we had expenses of million compared with expenses of million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of the increased scale of our participation in oil and gas exploration activities and additions to the office infrastructure combined with an asset impairment of million 
our general and administrative expenses increased to from million 
these general and administrative expenses include costs related to the corporate head office including administrative salaries and services  rent and office costs  insurance  bank guarantee fees  nyse amex listing and filing fees and transfer agent fees and services 
also included in our general and administrative expenses are our compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements with employees and directors which are being expensed over their respective vesting periods of the related option grants 
these stock based compensation costs decreased to from million for the same period in the majority of the increase in the general and administrative expenses  which is offset by the decrease in stock based compensation costs  is a result of an increase in bank guarantee fees of million  listing fees related to the new stock option plan of million  and salaries and benefits of million due to increase in staff levels over the prior year 
page our consulting fees increased to million during the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
this change is mostly attributable to the decrease in recovery of compensation costs for stock based compensation with non employee consultants for the year ended december  being a recovery of million versus a recovery of million for the year ended december  a portion of this increase is a result of the accounting for the consulting fees paid under our technical services agreement with a corporation wholly owned by mr 
roy  who is employed as a consultant to us  whereby we expensed million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  the balance of the increase is a result of other fees and expenses we incurred in employing various technical and corporate consultants who advised us on a variety of matters 
professional fees increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  professional fees include those paid to our auditors for pre approved audit  accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements 
legal fees increased approximately million in as compared to the prior year as a result of engaging a lawyer to assist in the negotiations of a settlement with respect to the carried interest agreement dispute 
this was partially offset by a decrease in audit and audit related fees in the same amount in versus the prior year 
during the year  we incurred an asset impairment expense of million versus nil during the year ended december  of this amount  million is a result of our decision not to exercise our option on the two exploration blocks in the arab republic of egypt and cease our exploration activities in oman and yemen 
the balance of million is a result of assessing our indian properties on an individual basis considering various factors  including land relinquishment and absence of proved reserves among others 
if the result of this assessment indicates impairment  then the related costs incurred are charged to the statement of operations 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in this decrease is directly related to the decrease in us prime interest rate in as compared to as well a decrease in our invested cash balances 
reflecting the increase in our general and administrative expenses  professional fees and consulting fees due to the increase in our overall oil and gas exploration activities combined with a decrease in interest income and an asset impairment  our net loss amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the same period in we capitalized overhead costs directly related to our exploration activities in india 
during the year ended december   these capitalized overhead costs were million as compared to million during the year ended december  the difference of million is mostly attributable to a decrease in the capitalized portion of the stock based compensation for our non employee consultants directly related in our oil and gas exploration activities for the year ended december  to versus million for the same period in years ended december  and during the year ended december   we had expenses of million compared with expenses of million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of the increased scale of our participation in oil and gas exploration activities and additions to the office infrastructure 
our general and administrative expenses increased to from million 
these general and administrative expenses include costs related to the corporate head office including administrative salaries and services  rent and office costs  insurance  american stock exchange listing and filing fees and transfer agent fees and services 
also included in our general and administrative expenses are our compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements with employees and directors which are being expensed over their respective vesting periods 
these stock based compensation costs increased to from million for the same period in the majority of the increase in the general and administrative expenses is a result of compensation costs of million related to the september  extension of the expiry date of the compensation options and the related compensation option warrants issued in a private sale of our securities in from september  to june  which were not incurred in the same period in the balance of the increase is due to the addition of an extra staff member in the calgary office offset by the decrease in stock based compensation costs 
our consulting fees decreased to million during the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
this change is mostly attributable to the decrease in compensation costs for stock based compensation with non employee consultants for the year ended december  being a recovery of million versus an expense of million for the year ended december  these consulting fees include million million paid under our technical services agreement with a corporation wholly owned by mr 
roy  and other fees and expenses we incurred in employing various technical and corporate consultants who advised us on a variety of matters 
page professional fees increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  professional fees include those paid to our auditors for pre approved audit  accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements 
legal fees increased from approximately million in to about million in in addition  costs associated with initiating the modeling  testing and documenting internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act were incurred during the year along with the work required to restate our financial statements for the years ending december    and this resulted in an increase from million for the year ending december   to million in the fees paid to our auditors and accountants for additional work incurred during the year ending december as compared to interest income increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in this improvement is directly related to a small increase in us prime interest rate in as compared to as well an increase in our invested cash balances resulting from our private sale of securities in june  reflecting the increase in our general and administrative expenses and professional fees due to the increase in our overall oil and gas exploration activities  as offset by the increase in interest income and a decrease in our consulting fees  our net loss amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the same period in on september   our board of directors adopted a resolution extending the expiration date of our outstanding stock purchase warrants from september  to june  accordingly  we recorded a charge to the deficit of million during the year ended december  for the incremental difference in the fair value of the stock purchase warrants immediately prior to and after the modification as compared to nil for the year ended december  when there was no such extension or charge recorded 
this resulted in a net loss and comprehensive loss applicable to common stockholders of compared to million during the year ended december  the impact of this warrant modification resulted in our earnings per share loss to decrease by a further per share for a total loss of per share 
we capitalized overhead costs directly related to our exploration activities in india 
during the year ended december   these capitalized overhead costs were compared to million during the year ended december  the difference of million is mostly attributable to a decrease in the capitalized portion of the stock based compensation for our non employee consultants directly related in our oil and gas exploration activities for the year ended december  to versus million for the same period in liquidity our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to complete further exploration and development activities and generate profitable operations from our oil and natural gas interests in the future 
our financial statements as at and for the year ended december  have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have incurred a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
these matters raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million december  million 
the majority of this balance is being held in us funds  of which million is held in term deposits earning interest based on the us prime rate 
in addition to our cash balances will earn interest on our term deposits which will contribute towards covering a portion of our administrative costs and overhead throughout we have working capital of approximately million which is available for the company s future operations 
in addition  we have million in restricted deposits pledged as security against the minimum work program which will be released upon completion of the minimum work program 
we expect to incur expenditures to further our exploration programs and our existing cash balance and any cash flow from operating activities may not be sufficient to satisfy our current obligations and meet our exploration commitments of million over the next three years 
we are considering various alternatives with respect to raising additional capital to remedy any future shortfall in capital but to date have made no specific plans or arrangements 
we may deem it necessary to raise capital through equity markets  debt markets or other financing arrangements  including participation arrangements that may be available for continued exploration expenditures 
because of the early stage of our operations  our absence of any oil and natural gas reserves and also as a result of the current global financial crisis and lack of liquidity in the banking system  there can be no assurance this capital will be available and if it is not  we may be forced to substantially curtail or cease exploration block acquisition and or exploration expenditures 
we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to maintain our current level of activities through the next fiscal year 
page should the going concern assumption not be appropriate and we are is not able to realize our assets and settle our liabilities  commitments and contingencies  as more fully described in our consolidated financial statements in the normal course of operations  our consolidated financial statements would require adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities  and these adjustments could be significant 
our consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments or reclassifications of assets and liabilities that would be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern 
we believe at this time that the outcome of the gspc carried interest dispute will not have a material effect on our liquidity 
years ended december  and during the year ended december   our overall position in cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  as compared to a net increase in the comparable period of of million 
these cash movements can be attributed to the following activities our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to an increase of approximately million in our general and administrative expenses  consulting and professional fees due to increased oil and gas exploration activities  combined with a significant decrease of approximately million in our interest income for the year ended december  as compared to cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was compared to million during the year ended december  funds of million were used for exploration activities and million for the acquisition of property and equipment in as compared to and million  respectively in this increase is consistent with our increased exploration costs in the cambay and rajasthan basins 
in addition  the increased investing activity in the year ended december  was an increase in the requirement to supply bank guarantees  such that in the year ended december  outlays were increased by million versus outlays for such instruments of only million for the year ended december  these bank guarantees have been provided and serve as guarantees for the performance of our minimum work programs and are in the form of irrevocable letters of credit which are secured by our term deposits in the same amount 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we issued  shares on the exercise of options for gross proceeds of million as compared to million on the issuance of  shares of common stock on the exercise of options in the prior year 
there were no private placement sales of our securities during as compared to  whereby we completed the sale of  units of our securities at per unit for aggregate cash gross proceeds of million less share issuance costs of million relating to the financing 
years ended december  and during the year ended december   our overall position in cash and cash equivalents increased by million  as compared to a net decrease in the comparable period of of million 
these cash movements can be attributed to the following activities our net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was compared to million during the year ended december  funds of million were used for exploration activities and million for the acquisition of property and equipment in as compared to and million in this increase is consistent with our increased drilling costs in the cambay area as well as exploration costs incurred in bidding and evaluating new exploration blocks in the arab republic of egypt 
in addition  we incurred fixed asset expenditures  mainly for an office condominium in gandhinagar  india plus improvements which were completed during the third quarter at a total cost of approximately million 
offsetting the increased investing activity in the year ended december  was a reduction in the requirement to supply bank guarantees  such that in the year ended december  outlays were reduced to 
million versus outlays for such instruments of for the year ended december  these bank guarantees have been provided and serve as guarantees for the performance of our minimum work program  and are in the form of irrevocable letters of credit which are secured by our term deposits in the same amount 
these investing outlays were also offset by a combined increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and prepaids and deposits of million in the year ended december  as compared to a combined net increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and prepaids and deposits of million in the same period of page cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we completed the sale of  units of our securities at per unit for aggregate cash gross proceeds of million less share issuance costs of million relating to financing activities 
further  during the year ended december   cash of million was provided from the issuance of  shares of common stock on the exercise of options  as compared to cash of million from the issuance of  shares of common stock on the exercise of options and purchase warrants less share issuance costs of million 
capital resources we expect our exploration and development activities pursuant to the pscs we are a party to  and the related drilling activities in the exploration blocks that we hold an interest in  will continue through in accordance with the terms of those agreements 
during the period april  to march   based on the current budgets  we anticipate drilling thirty four wells which entail approximately three exploratory wells in the kg offshore block  one appraisal well in mehsana  two exploratory and five appraisal wells in sanand miroli  nine exploration and two appraisal wells in ankleshwar and eight appraisal and four development wells on our tarapur block 
in addition  we may seek to participate in joint ventures bidding for the award of further pscs for exploration blocks expected to be awarded by the government of india in the future 
as of march   we have no specific plans to join with others in bidding for any specific pscs in india and elsewhere 
we expect that our interest in any such ventures would involve a minority participating interest in the venture 
in addition  as opportunities arise  we may seek to acquire minority participating interests in exploration blocks where pscs have been heretofore awarded 
the acquisition of any such interests would be subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and obtaining the requisite government consents and other approvals 
we may during the year seek to participate in joint venture bidding for the acquisition of oil and gas interests in other international countries  however  as of march   we have made no specific plans regarding such activities and have not entered into any binding agreements with respect to such activities 
depending upon the scope of our activities during the years and  we may require additional capital for the funding of our activities under the pscs we are currently a party to as well as support for our bidding for other pscs that may be awarded in india or elsewhere 
in addition  we may require additional funds for the possible acquisition of further minority participating interests in pscs in drilling blocks heretofore awarded and that we may hereafter propose to enter into in india and possibly elsewhere 
we believe it can be expected that our interest in further or additional pscs would be a participating interest 
as the holder of a participating interest in any such activities  it can be expected that we will be required to contribute capital to any such ventures in proportion to our percentage interest 
as of march   the scope of any possible such activities has not been definitively established and  accordingly  we are unable to state the amount of any funds that may be required for these purposes 
as a result  no specific plans or arrangements have been made to raise additional capital and we have not entered into any agreements in that regard 
we expect that if we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities 
as of march   we are unable to estimate the terms on which any such capital may be raised  the price per share or possible number of shares involved 
we do not expect to have any significant change in in our number of employees 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations by type of agreement and due during the year ended december  and succeeding twelve month periods 
where the amounts of payments are  this indicates we have no material obligations under such types of agreements 
payments due by period in millions contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease operating lease purchase asset retirement obligation financial commitments under pscs total under the pscs  we are obligated to pay for our proportionate share of the multi year exploration expenses in fulfilling the work programs on the exploration blocks

under the terms of the psc  gspc is committed to expend further funds for the exploration of and drilling on the kg offshore block 
preliminary estimates made in august were that expenditures attributable to us would total approximately million over the year term of the psc 
additional drilling costs incurred in drilling to depths in excess of  meters versus shallower depths as originally anticipated  as well as the testing and completion costs of these wells  resulted in actual costs significantly exceeding our original budgeted expenditures 
the estimated budget for costs to be incurred by gspc during the remainder of the exploration phase of the psc for the nine month period ending september  attributable to us under the carried interest agreement is approximately million 
of this amount  is for the account of roy group mauritius ltd

as provided in the carried interest agreement  we will be required to bear the expenditures attributable to us after the start date of initial commercial production on the kg offshore block 
we will not realize cash flow from the kg offshore block until such time as the expenditures attributed to us  including those expenditures made for the account of roy group mauritius ltd 
under the carried interest agreement have been recovered by gspc from future production revenue 
under the terms of the carried interest agreement  all of our proportionate share of capital costs for exploration and development activities must be repaid to gspc without interest over the projected production life or ten years  whichever is less

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are outlined in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of our operations and cash flows in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
oil and gas accounting and impairment the accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires that we choose between generally accepted accounting principle alternatives 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas operations 
under this method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties are capitalized 
to date we are currently in the development stage and have not yet found any commercial reserves 
expenditures in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties  the costs of which are individually significant  are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  these properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is charged to the statement of operations 
asset retirement obligation legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets result from the acquisition  construction  development and normal use of the asset 
our asset retirement obligations relate primarily to the retirement of oil and gas properties and related production facilities  lines and other equipment used in the field operations 
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred  if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the estimated fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset 
this additional carrying amount is then depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability increases due to the passage of time based on the time value of money until the obligation is settled 
this requires us to use significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations 
page stock based compensation we are required to recognize compensation cost for stock based compensation arrangements with employees  non employee consultants and non employee directors based on their grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  such cost to be expensed over the compensations respective vesting periods 
for awards with graded vesting  in which portions of the award vest in different periods  we recognize compensation costs over the vesting periods for each separate vested tranche 
we record the estimated fair value of the equity instrument expense of options granted to non employee consultants on the measurement date 
we re measure the fair value of the unvested portion of stock based awards to non employee consultants  resulting in charges or credits to operations in periods when changes in the market price of our common stock directly impact the associated stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation for non employee consultants is expensed or capitalized based on the nature of the consultant s activities 
inherent in determining the fair value of options are several judgments and estimates that must be made 
these include determining the underlying valuation methodology for share compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation  such as our expected stock price volatility  expected term of the options granted to employees and consultants and the expected risk free interest rate 
changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted to employees  non employee directors and non employee consultants

fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us generally accepted accounting principals and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the financial accounting standard board issued fasb staff position  sfas which delayed the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
these non financial items include assets and liabilities such as reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test  asset retirement obligations and non financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
in october  the financial accounting standard board also issued fasb staff position sfas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of sfas in an inactive market and illustrates how an entity would determine fair value when the market for a financial asset is not active 
effective january   we adopted sfas for financial assets and liabilities 
the partial adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
beginning january   we will adopt the provisions for non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis  which include those measured at fair value in indefinite lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment  non financial long lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment  asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value  and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination we currently do not have any financial assets that are valued using inactive markets  and as a result  we are not impacted by the issuance of fsp no 
sfas in february  the financial accounting standard board issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value fair value option 
election of the fair value option is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
page following the election of the fair value option for certain financial assets and liabilities  we would report unrealized gains and losses due to changes in fair value in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
we adopted this statement january  and did not elect the fair value option for any of its eligible financial instruments or other items 
as such  the adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standard board issued fas no 
r  business combinations 
fas r replaces fas no 
 business combinations 
fas r retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
generally  fas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations completed on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of fas r to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  provided that we do not undertake a significant acquisition or business combination 
in december  the financial accounting standard board issued fas no

modernization of oil and gas reporting on december   the united states securities and exchange commission released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting to revise the existing regulation s k and regulation s x reporting requirements to align with current industry practices and technological advances 
many of the revisions are updates to definitions in the existing oil and gas accounting rules to make them consistent with the petroleum resource management system  which is a widely accepted standard for the management of petroleum resources that was developed by several industry organizations 
key revisions include a permitting the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes  b allow companies to disclose in securities filed documents  their probable and possible reserves to investors currently  the united states securities and exchange commission rules limit disclosure to only proved reserves  c require companies to report the independence and qualifications of a reserves preparer or auditor  d file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit  and e report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
the united states securities and exchange commission will require companies to comply with the amended disclosure requirements for registration statements filed after january   and for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on our disclosures  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices 
we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with the following interest rate risk we consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be immaterial 
interest rate exposures relate entirely to our investment portfolio  as we do not have short term or long term debt 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality bank issuers at overnight rates  or government securities of the united states or canadian federal governments such as guaranteed investment certificates or treasury bills 
we do not hold any of these investments for trading purposes 
we do not hold equity investments 
we do not expect any material loss from cash equivalents and therefore we believe our interest rate exposure on invested funds is not material 
page foreign currency exchange risk substantially  all of our cash and cash equivalents are held in us dollars or us dollar denominated securities 
certain of our expenses are fixed or denominated by foreign currencies including the canadian dollar and the indian rupees 
we are exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
at december   we had not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments relating to our foreign currency exchange risk 
commodity price risk oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  international supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both international and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our ability to obtain capital to fund our activities and could in the future require a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
similarly  an improvement in oil and gas prices can have a favourable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
at december   we had not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments as such term is defined in item of regulation s k  relating to oil and natural gas 
trading risks we have no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes
