overview we are the leading provider of onshore seismic data acquisition services in the lower states of the united states as measured by the number of active data acquisition crews 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients  mainly domestic oil and natural gas companies 
demand for our services depends upon the level of spending by these companies for exploration  production  development and field management activities  which depends  in part  on oil and natural gas prices 
significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected the demand for our services and our results of operations in years past  and such fluctuations continue today to be the single most important factor affecting our business and results of operations 
our return to profitability in fiscal after several years of losses was directly related to an increase in the level of exploration for domestic oil and natural gas reserves by the petroleum industry since the increased level of exploration was a function of higher prices for oil and natural gas 
as a result of the increase in domestic exploration spending  we experienced an increased demand for our seismic data acquisition and processing services during this period  particularly from entities seeking natural gas reserves 
beginning in august  the prices of oil and especially natural gas declined significantly from historic highs due to reduced demand from the global economic slowdown  and during many domestic oil and natural gas companies reduced their capital expenditures due to the decrease in market prices and disruptions in the credit markets 
these factors led to a severe reduction in demand for our services and in our industry in general during as well as downward pressure on the prices we charge our customers for our services 
in order to better align our crew capacity with reduced demand  we have reduced the number of data acquisition crews we operate from sixteen at the end of fiscal to nine as of october due to the reductions in the number of our active data acquisition crews and lower utilization rates for our remaining operating crews  we have experienced a reduction in operating revenues and operating costs during 
table of contents calendar  and we anticipate that such reductions will continue into calendar  and possibly beyond  depending on future market prices for oil and natural gas and the level of domestic exploration spending 
in light of current market difficulties  we are focusing our efforts on reducing costs  limiting capital expenditures and maintaining our financial strength 
equipment and key personnel from crews taken out of service will be redeployed on remaining crews as needed or otherwise remain available for rapid expansion of crew count as demand and market conditions dictate in the future 
while our revenues are mainly affected by the level of client demand for our services  our revenues are also affected by the pricing for our services that we negotiate with our clients and the productivity of our data acquisition crews  including factors such as crew downtime related to inclement weather  delays in acquiring land access permits or equipment failure 
consequently  our efforts to negotiate favorable contract terms in our supplemental service agreements  to mitigate access permit delays and to improve overall crew productivity may partially offset the impact of reduced demand and anticipated contract price weaknesses 
although our clients may cancel their service contracts on short notice  our current order book reflects commitment levels sufficient to maintain operation of our nine data acquisition crews into calendar while the markets for oil and natural gas have been very volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future  and we can make no assurances as to future levels of domestic exploration or commodity prices  we believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our market position by responding to our clients continuing desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
if economic conditions do not improve or were to worsen  our customers do not increase their capital expenditures  or there is a significant sustained drop in oil and natural gas prices  it would result in continued diminished demand for our seismic services  may cause continued downward pressure on the prices we charge and would continue to affect our results of operations 
because primarily all of our current clients are focused on the exploration for and production of natural gas  a continued pressure on the price of natural gas in particular would have a negative effect on the demand for our services 
in recent quarters this risk has been mitigated somewhat as we have experienced increased demand for our services in several oil producing basins based on oil prices that began to rebound in the second and third quarters of fiscal results of operations fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of a reduction in active crew count during the second quarter of fiscal four crews and the third quarter of fiscal two crews  a more competitive pricing environment  substantially lower utilization rates for remaining crews and  in the fourth quarter  increased downtime for weather 
recorded in fiscal revenues are continued high third party charges primarily related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies and dynamite energy sources  all of which are utilized in areas with limited access 
the sustained level of these charges during fiscal was driven by our continued operations in areas with limited access in the appalachian basin  arkansas  east texas and louisiana 
we are reimbursed for these charges by our clients 
operating costs 
our operating expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to reductions in field personnel and other expenses of operating the six data acquisition crews taken out of service during the second and third quarters of fiscal as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal general and administration expenses increased by approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the primary factor in the increase in general and administration expenses during fiscal was an increase to the company s allowance for doubtful accounts during the year of  offset by bad debts during the year of approximately  resulting in a net allowance for doubtful accounts at september  of  the deductions against the bad debt allowance were primarily a result of the settlement of a previously disputed invoice for approximately  we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts during fiscal based on our review of the past due accounts and client base 
during the second quarter  we became aware that one current client with an accounts receivable balance of approximately million and two former 
table of contents clients had filed for reorganization under bankruptcy protection 
these facts significantly influenced management s decision to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts during the second quarter 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflecting the full year of depreciation expense from our fiscal capital expenditures 
due to market conditions  capital expenditures in fiscal were limited to necessary maintenance capital requirements 
depreciation expense  however  is expected to remain relatively unchanged during fiscal our total operating costs for fiscal were  a decrease of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
income tax expense was  for fiscal and  for fiscal the effective tax rate for the income tax provision for fiscal and was and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate between periods was primarily a result of an increase in the unrecognized tax benefits reserve for prior years  changes in tax rates as a result of the varying states in which we operate from year to year and the increasing impact of permanent tax differences resulting from lower income before income taxes 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of high demand for our services 
revenue growth in fiscal was primarily the result of the addition of new seismic data acquisition crews in september and may and the upgrading of recording systems on existing crews  along with increased channel counts and productivity on existing crews 
recorded in fiscal revenues are continued high third party charges primarily related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies and dynamite energy sources  all of which are utilized in areas with limited access 
the sustained level of these charges during fiscal was driven by our continued operations in areas with limited access in the appalachian basin  the rocky mountains  the fayetteville shale and the arkoma basin 
we are reimbursed for these charges by our clients 
operating costs 
our operating expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to the full year of service for the three acquisition crews deployed in fiscal and the additional crew placed into service in fiscal as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal while the ratio of general and administrative expenses to revenue declined in fiscal due to the increase in revenues  the actual dollar amount increased 
the increase of  from fiscal to fiscal reflects ongoing expenses necessary to support expanded field operations 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflecting the full year of depreciation expense from our fiscal capital expenditures 
our total operating costs for fiscal were  an increase of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
income tax expense was  for fiscal and  for fiscal the effective tax rate for the income tax provision for fiscal and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate between periods was primarily a result of changes in state tax rates as a result of the varying states in which we operate from year to year 
liquidity and capital resources introduction 
our principal sources of cash are amounts earned from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients 
our principal uses of cash are the amounts used to provide these services  including expenses related to our operations and acquiring new equipment 
accordingly  our cash position depends as do our revenues on the level of demand for our services 
historically  cash generated from our operations along with cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks have been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  and to some extent  our capital expenditures 

table of contents cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal and  for fiscal the amount in fiscal primarily reflects an increase in total revenues resulting from our expanded business and an increase in accounts receivable without a correlating increase in accounts payable 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal primarily reflects our reduced revenues during fiscal and a decrease in accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects the decrease in our revenues  as the number of days in receivables has not significantly changed over the last twelve months 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal in fiscal  the net cash used in investing activities primarily represents capital expenditures made with cash generated from operations 
due to market conditions  our capital expenditures in fiscal were limited to necessary maintenance capital requirements rather than investing in additional equipment as in the past few years 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we used cash generated from operations in excess of capital expenditures to acquire short term investments 
our short term investments consist of two us treasury bills and two us treasury notes with a total cost of  and three fdic guaranteed bonds with a total cost of  the contractual maturities of these short term investments range from december to december in fiscal  we collected proceeds from an insurance claim on our equipment burned in a march wildfire of  net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of  primarily represents proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal of  primarily represents the net decrease on our revolving line of credit loan agreement from a balance at september  of  to a zero balance at september  capital expenditures 
for fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of  during the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased an aram aries ii recording system equipped with channels from existing crews and replacement vehicles 
for the remainder of fiscal  we limited our capital expenditures to necessary maintenance capital requirements 
the board of directors has approved an initial fiscal budget of   of which will be used to purchase a  station oyo gsr four channel recording system along with three component geophones and the remainder will be used to meet necessary maintenance requirements during fiscal the addition of the oyo gsr recording equipment will allow us to record  channels of cable less multi component data or up to  channels of conventional seismic data  either as a stand alone system or as added channel count and increased flexibility for our aram recording systems 
we believe these additions will allow the company to maintain its competitive position as it responds to client desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
we continually strive to supply our clients with technologically advanced d data acquisition recording services and data processing capabilities 
we maintain equipment in and out of service in anticipation of increased future demand for our services 
capital resources 
historically  we have primarily relied on cash generated from operations  cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks to fund our working capital requirements and  to some extent  capital expenditures 
we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs from time to time through public equity offerings 
our revolving line of credit loan agreement is with western national bank 
on june   we renewed the existing agreement for a two year term on substantially the same terms as the previous facility 
in addition  based on our assessment of our current needs  we reduced the size of the facility to million from million 
the agreement permits us to borrow  repay and reborrow  from time to time until june   up to million based on the borrowing base calculation as defined in the agreement 
our obligations under this agreement are secured by a security interest in our accounts receivable  equipment and related collateral 
interest on the facility accrues at an annual rate equal to either the day london interbank offered rate libor  plus two and one quarter percent or the prime rate  minus three quarters percent as we direct monthly  subject to an interest rate floor of 
interest on the outstanding amount under the loan agreement is payable monthly 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including limitations on disposition of assets  mergers and reorganizations 
we are also obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the loan agreement  including maintaining specified ratios with respect to cash flow coverage  current assets and liabilities and debt to tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of september  and november  we have not utilized the 
table of contents line of credit loan agreement since we paid off the entire outstanding balance of million as of september  on march   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec covering the periodic offer and sale of up to million in debt securities  preferred and common stock and warrants 
the registration statement allows us to sell securities in one or more separate offerings with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of sale 
the terms of any securities offered would be described in a related prospectus to be filed separately with the sec at the time of the offering 
the filing of the shelf registration statement will enable us to act quickly if and when opportunities arise 
the following table summarizes payments due in specific periods related to our contractual obligations with initial terms exceeding one year as of september  payments due by period in s less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations we believe that our capital resources and cash flow from operations are adequate to meet our current operational needs 
we believe we will be able to finance our capital requirements through cash flow from operations and  if necessary  through borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
however  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and fund future capital requirements will depend principally upon our future operating performance  which is subject to the risks inherent in our business including the demand for our seismic services from clients 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition during the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
because of the use of assumptions and estimates inherent in the reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
these contracts are either turnkey or term agreements 
under both types of agreements  we recognize revenues when revenue is realizable and services are performed 
services are defined as the commencement of data acquisition or processing operations 
revenues are considered realizable when earned according to the terms of the service contracts 
under turnkey agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of data acquired rate  as services are performed 
under term agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of time worked rate  as services are performed 
in the case of a cancelled service contract  we recognize revenue and bill our client for services performed up to the date of cancellation 
we also receive reimbursements for certain out of pocket expenses under the terms of our service contracts 
we record amounts billed to clients in revenue at the gross amount including out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by the client 
in some instances  we bill clients in advance of the services performed 
in those cases  we recognize the liability as deferred revenue 
as services are performed  those amounts are reversed and recognized as revenue 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we prepare our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our review of past due accounts  our past experience of historical write offs and our current client base 
while the collectibility of outstanding client invoices is continually assessed  the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of our clients 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment when triggering events occur suggesting deterioration in the assets recoverability or fair value 
recognition of an impairment charge is required if future expected undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets and the fair value of the assets is below the carrying value of the assets 
our forecast of future cash flows used to perform impairment analysis includes estimates of future revenues and expenses based on our anticipated future results while considering anticipated future oil and gas prices  which is fundamental in assessing demand for our services 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows  we measure the amount of possible impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment 
our property  plant and equipment are capitalized at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
our estimation of this useful life is based on circumstances that exist in the seismic industry and information available at the time of the purchase of the asset 
as circumstances change and new information becomes available  these estimates could change 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations for the period 
tax accounting 
we account for our income taxes with the recognition of amounts of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we determine deferred taxes by identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences  measuring the total deferred tax asset or liability using the applicable tax rate and reducing the deferred tax asset by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our methodology for recording income taxes requires judgment regarding assumptions and the use of estimates  including determining our annual effective tax rate and the valuation of deferred tax assets  which can create a variance between actual results and estimates and could have a material impact on our provision or benefit for income taxes 
stock based compensation 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards  including stock options and restricted stock  using the fair value method and recognize compensation cost  net of forfeitures  in our financial statements 
we record compensation expense as operating or general and administrative expense as appropriate in the statements of operations on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related stock options or restricted stock awards 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asc clarifies that fair value is the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
further  the standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands certain disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc became effective for all financial assets and financial liabilities as of october   and upon adoption  asc did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asc a  fair value measurements and disclosures transition and open effective date information  which delays the effective date of asc for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we do not expect the adoption of asc a to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asc  financial instruments 
asc provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
as of september   we have not 
table of contents elected the fair value option for any additional financial assets and liabilities beyond those already prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in april  the fasb issued asc  financial instruments transition and open effective date information 
asc requires fair value disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements in order to provide more timely information about the effects of current market conditions on financial instruments 
asc became effective for us as of june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for  and requires disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
we adopted the provisions of asc for the quarter ended june  the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we have evaluated events subsequent to our balance sheet date september  through the issue date of this form k november  and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that require recognition in the financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asc  generally accepted accounting principles 
asc provides for the fasb accounting standards codification the codification to become the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles 
the codification did not change gaap but reorganizes the literature 
asc became effective for us for the year ended september  the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary sources of market risk include fluctuations in commodity prices which affect demand for and pricing of our services as well as interest rate fluctuations 
our revolving line of credit carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in interest rates 
outstanding balances under our revolving line of credit bear interest at our monthly direction of the lower of the prime rate minus three quarters percent or the day libor plus two and one quarter percent  subject to an interest rate floor of 
at september   we had no balances outstanding on our revolving line of credit 
short term investments held at september  consist of two us treasury bills and two us treasury notes of approximately  each with a total cost of  and a fair value of  and three fdic guaranteed bonds with a total cost of  and a fair value of  the contractual maturities of these short term investments range from december to december our short term investments are classified for accounting purposes as available for sale 
if these short term investments are not held to maturity  the proceeds obtained when the instruments are sold will be impacted by the current interest rates at the time they are sold 
we have not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently conduct business internationally  so we are not generally subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk
