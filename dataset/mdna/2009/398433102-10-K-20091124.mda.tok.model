substantially all of such liabilities are expected to be paid during certain of the company s subsidiaries are also contingently liable for approximately million related to certain facilities leases with varying terms through that were assigned to the respective purchasers of certain of the installation services businesses 
the company does not believe it has a material exposure related to these contingencies 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dispositions  bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the company remains in a strong financial position with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on both a short term and long term basis 
the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows cash flows from continuing operations years ended september  in thousands net cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows generated by operating activities for decreased million to million compared to million in the prior year 
current assets net of current liabilities excluding short term debt and cash decreased million to million at september  compared to million at the prior year end  primarily due to lower inventory on hand at building products due to the restructuring and lower sales volumes 
during  the company used cash from investing activities of million compared to million in the prior year 
the company had capital expenditures of million  million lower than the prior year 
during  cash used in financing activities was million 
the principal financing usage was for the repurchase of million face value of convertible notes for million and the purchase of common stock by the company s employee stock ownership plan esop of million  these uses were partially offset by million of rights offering proceeds see below 
approximately million shares of common stock are available for purchase pursuant to the company s stock buyback program and additional purchases  including those pursuant to a b plan  may be made  depending upon market conditions and other factors  at prices deemed appropriate by management 
payments from revenue derived from the telephonics segment are received in accordance with the terms of development and production subcontracts to which the company is a party 
certain of the payments received in this segment are progress payments 
customers in the plastics segment are generally substantial industrial companies whose payments have been steady  reliable and made in accordance with the terms governing such sales  sales in this segment are made to satisfy orders that are received in advance of production  where payment terms are established in advance of such production and sale 
with respect to the building products segment  there have been no material adverse impacts on payment for sales 
a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of historical revenue  and the company expects that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of revenue for the foreseeable future 
approximately and of total revenue for and  and and of plastics revenue for and  is from procter gamble  which is plastics largest customer 
home depot and menards are significant customers of building products and lockheed martin corporation and the boeing company are significant customers of telephonics 
future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of large customers and the company s relationships with them 
orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially 
the loss of all or a portion of the sales volume from any one of these customers would likely have an adverse affect on the company s liquidity and operations 
at september   the company had cash and equivalents  net of debt  as follows cash  cash equivalents and debt at september  in thousands cash and equivalents notes payables and current portion of long term debt long term debt  net of current maturities total debt cash and equivalents  net of debt in august  the company s board of directors authorized a million share common stock rights offering to its shareholders in order to raise equity capital for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth

in june  building products and plastics entered into a credit agreement for their domestic operations with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and the lenders party thereto  pursuant to which the lenders agreed to provide a five year  senior secured revolving credit facility of million the clopay credit agreement 
at september   million was outstanding under the clopay credit agreement and approximately million was available for borrowing 
the telephonics credit agreement and the clopay credit agreement include various sublimits for standby letters of credit 
at september   there were approximately million of aggregate standby letters of credit outstanding under these credit facilities 
these credit agreements limit dividends and advances that these subsidiaries may pay to the parent 
the agreements permit the payment of income taxes  overhead and expenses  with dividends or advances in excess of these amounts being limited based on a with respect to the clopay credit agreement  maintaining certain minimum availability under the loan agreement or b with respect to the telephonics credit agreement  compliance with certain conditions and limited to an annual maximum 
at september   the company was not  nor was it reasonably likely to be  in breach of covenants under its respective credit facilities 
the clopay credit agreement provides for credit availability primarily based on working capital assets and imposes only one ratio compliance requirement  which becomes operative only in the event that utilization of that facility were to reach a defined level significantly beyond the september  level 
the telephonics credit agreement is a cash flow based facility and compliance with required ratios at september  was well within the parameters set forth in that agreement 
further  the covenants within such credit facilities do not materially affect the company s ability to undertake additional debt or equity financing for griffon  the parent company  as such credit facilities are at the subsidiary level and are not guaranteed by griffon 
the company had million outstanding of convertible subordinated notes due the notes as of september  holders of the notes may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on july   and  as well as upon a change in control 
if griffon s common stock price is below the conversion price of the notes on the earliest of these dates  management anticipates that noteholders will require griffon to repurchase their outstanding notes 
as such  these notes are classified under notes payable and current portion of long term debt in the fourth quarter of the fair value is approximately million  which is based on quoted market price level inputs 
during  the company purchased million face value of the notes from certain noteholders for million 
the company recorded a pre tax gain from debt extinguishment of approximately million  offset by a million proportionate reduction in the related deferred financing costs for a net gain of million 
at september   the company had million outstanding of notes 
the company s esop has a loan agreement  guaranteed by the company  which requires payments of principal and interest through the expiration date of september at which time the million balance of the loan  and any outstanding interest  will be payable 
the primary purpose of this loan  and it predecessor loans which were refinanced by this loan in october  was to purchase  shares of the company s stock in october the loan bears interest at rates based upon the prime rate or libor 
the loan balance was million as of september   and the outstanding balance approximates fair value 
during the year ended september   the company used cash for discontinued operations of million related to settling remaining installation services liabilities 
contractual obligations at september   payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years other long term debt a interest expense rental commitments purchase obligations b capital leases capital expenditures supplemental post retirement benefits c uncertain tax positions d total obligations a at september   the company had outstanding million of the notes due holders of the notes may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on july   and  and upon a change in control 
the company is presenting the million outstanding on the notes in the less than year category above because the noteholders can require the company to repurchase the notes in july b the purchase obligations are generally for the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business 
the company uses blanket purchase orders to communicate expected requirements to certain of its vendors 
purchase obligations reflect those purchase orders where the commitment is considered to be firm 
purchase obligations that extend beyond are principally related to long term contracts received from customers of telephonics 
c the company expects to contribute million to the qualified defined benefit plan in  which is included in the less than year column above 
there are no amounts related to the qualified defined benefit plan for subsequent periods 
the company funds required payouts under the non qualified supplemental defined benefit plan from its general assets and the expected payments are included in each period  as applicable 
d due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions  management is unable to estimate the timing of related payments  if any  that will be made subsequent to these amounts do not include any potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases and purchase obligations as disclosed herein  the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements 
accounting policies and pronouncements critical accounting policies the preparation of griffon s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in public disclosures of the company  including information regarding contingencies  risk and its financial condition 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions  and form the basis for estimating the carrying values of assets and liabilities  as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment for commitments and contingencies 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
an estimate is considered to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the following have been identified as the most critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the following circumstances are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services are rendered  c price is fixed and determinable and d collectability is reasonably assured 
goods are sold on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point 
revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale 
other than standard product warranty provisions  sales arrangements provide for no other significant post shipment obligations 
from time to time and for certain customers rebates and other sales incentives  promotional allowances or discounts are offered  typically related to customer purchase volumes  all of which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue and recorded at the time of sale 
griffon provides for sales returns allowances based upon historical returns experience 
telephonics earns a substantial portion of its revenue as either a prime or subcontractor from contract awards with the us government  as well as non us governments and other commercial customers 
these formal contracts are typically long term in nature  usually greater than one year 
revenue and profits from these long term fixed price contracts are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue and profits on fixed price contracts that contain engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract cost to cost method 
using the cost to cost method  revenue is recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion  multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue  less the cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods 
the profit recorded on a contract using this method is equal to the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative revenue recognized  less the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract in prior periods 
as this method relies on the substantial use of estimates  these projections may be revised throughout the life of a contract 
components of this formula and ratio that may be estimated include gross profit margin and total costs at completion 
the cost performance and estimates to complete on long term contracts are reviewed  at a minimum  on a quarterly basis  as well as when information becomes available that would necessitate a review of the current estimate 
adjustments to estimates for a contract s estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss often are required as experience is gained  and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may or may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
the impact of such adjustments or changes to estimates is made on a cumulative basis in the period when such information has become known 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products  systems and services  production efficiencies  price competition and general economic conditions 
revenue and profits on cost reimbursable type contracts are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract  at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs 
the estimated profit on a cost reimbursable contract may be fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement 
incentive and award fees on these contracts are recorded as revenue when the criteria under which they are earned are reasonably assured of being met and can be estimated 
for contracts whose anticipated total costs exceed the total expected revenue  an estimated loss is recognized in the period when identifiable 
a provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded on a cumulative basis 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is probable  and are determined on a percentage of completion basis measured by the cost to cost method 
warranty accruals direct customer and end user warranties are provided on certain products 
these warranties cover manufacturing defects that would prevent the product from performing in line with its intended and marketed use 
the terms of these warranties vary by product line and generally provide for the repair or replacement of the defective product 
warranty claims data is collected and analyzed with a focus on the historical amount of claims  the products involved  the amount of time between the warranty claims and the products respective sales and the amount of current sales 
based on these analyses  warranty accruals are recorded as an increase to cost of sales and regularly reviewed for adequacy 
stock based compensation griffon has issued stock based compensation to certain employees  officers and directors in the form of stock options and non vested restricted stock 
for stock option grants made on or after october   expense is recognized over the awards expected vesting period based on their fair value as calculated using the black scholes pricing model 
the black scholes pricing model uses estimated assumptions for a forfeiture rate  the expected life of the options and a volatility rate using historical data 
compensation expense for non vested restricted stock is recognized ratably over the service period based on the fair value of the grant calculated as the number of shares granted multiplied by the stock price on the date of grant 
allowances for discount  doubtful account and returns trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount  less allowances for discounts  doubtful accounts and returns 
the allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations usually due to customers potential insolvency  discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and estimates for returns 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified  as well as an amount for customer defaults based on a general formula when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable  but cannot yet be associated with specific customers 
allowance for discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
goodwill  long lived intangible and tangible assets  and impairment griffon has significant intangible and tangible long lived assets on its balance sheet which includes goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
as required under gaap  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually  for griffon in september  or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment involves the significant use of judgment and assumptions in the determination of a reporting unit s fair market value 
long lived amortizable intangible assets  such as customer relationships and software  and tangible assets  which is primarily made up of property  plant and equipment  are amortized over their expected useful lives  which involves significant assumptions and estimates 
long lived intangible and tangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset when an impairment indicator  such as change in business  customer loss or obsolete technology  exists 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time  but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects  which may result from a decline in griffon s stock price  a change in market conditions  market trends  interest rates or other factors outside of griffon s control  or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of griffon s reporting units  which could result in an impairment charge in the future 
restructuring reserves from time to time  the company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation 
these reserves for both termination and other exit costs require the use of estimates 
though griffon believes the estimates made are reasonable  they could differ materially from the actual costs 
income taxes griffon s effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
for interim financial reporting  the annual tax rate is estimated based on projected taxable income for the full year and a quarterly income tax provision is recorded in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the year progresses  the estimates are refined based on the year s taxable income as new information becomes available  including year to date financial results 
this continual estimation process often results in a change to the effective tax rate throughout the year 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which a tax benefit has been recorded in the income statement 
the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed at least quarterly  and the valuation allowance  if any  is adjusted accordingly 
tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law developments and new or emerging legislation 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
the effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which griffon has recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  griffon believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate 
favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in griffon s tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent 
however  if it is anticipated that a cash settlement will occur within one year  that portion of the liability is presented as current 
interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income tax expense 
pension benefits griffon sponsors two defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retired employees 
annual amounts relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases and turnover rates 
the actuarial assumptions used to determine pension liabilities and assets  as well as pension expense  are reviewed on an annual basis when modifications to assumptions are made based on current economic conditions and trends 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans investments and expectations for long term rates of return 
the discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments 
the assumptions utilized in recording the company s obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable based on experience and advice from independent actuaries  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect griffon s financial position or results of operations 
the qualified defined benefit plan has been frozen to new entrants since december certain employees who were part of the plan prior to december continue to accrue a service benefit for an additional years  at which time all plan participants will stop accruing service benefits 
newly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the accounting for business combinations 
the purpose of the new guidance is to better represent the economic value of a business combination transaction 
the new guidance retains the fundamental requirement of the old guidance where the acquisition method of accounting is to be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
in general the new guidance broadens the existing guidance by extending its applicability to all events where one entity obtains control over one or more businesses  broadens the use of the fair value measurements used to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  changes the accounting for acquisition related fees and restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition and increases required disclosure
