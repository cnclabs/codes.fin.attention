our marketing solutions products are typically delivered on a monthly  quarterly or ad hoc basis through electronic reports and analyses 
our company was founded in august by  we had established a panel of internet users and began delivering digital marketing intelligence products that measured online browsing and buying behavior to our first customers 
we also introduced netscore  our initial syndicated internet audience measurement product 
we accelerated our introduction of new products in with the launch of plan metrix formerly aim  qsearch  and the campaign r f reach and frequency analysis system and product offerings that measure online activity at the local market level 
by  we had built a global panel of over two million internet users 
in that year  in cooperation with arbitron  we launched a service that provides ratings of online radio audiences 
in  we expanded our presence in europe by opening an office in london 
in  we continued to expand our measurement capabilities with the launch of world metrix  a product that provides worldwide data on digital media usage  and video metrix  our product that measures the audience for streaming online video 
in  we completed our initial public offering  resulting in the sale and issuance by us of  shares of our common stock  and we also launched ten new products during that year  including campaign metrix  qsearch  ad metrix  brand metrix  segment metrix and comscore marketer 
during the first quarter of  we launched ad metrix advertiser view  a tool for agencies and publishers designed to support their media buying and selling activities and supply their competitive intelligence needs 
in april  we launched the second generation of our media planning product  plan metrix  and increased the frequency of reporting from semi annual to a monthly cycle 
in october  we launched extended web measurement which allows the tracking of distributed web content across third party sites  such as video  music  gaming applications  widgets and social media 
it enables publishers to report audience reach and characteristics of their various advertising sales packages providing them with the ability to market those packages more effectively 
we have complemented our internal development initiatives with select acquisitions 
on june   we acquired certain media metrix assets from jupiter media metrix  inc through this acquisition  we acquired certain internet audience measurement services that report details of web site usage and visitor demographics 
on july   we acquired the outstanding stock of denaro and associates  inc  otherwise known as q brand intelligence  inc or q  to improve our ability to provide our customers more robust survey research integrated with our underlying digital marketing intelligence platform 
on january   we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of surveysite inc  or surveysite 
through this acquisition  we acquired proprietary internet based data collection technologies and increased our customer penetration and revenues in the survey business 
on may   we acquired the outstanding stock of m metrics  inc to expand our abilities to provide our customers a more robust solution for the mobile medium 
the total cost of the acquisition of m metrics was approximately million  consisting of cash and transaction fees 
our total revenues have grown to million during the fiscal year ending december  from million during the fiscal year ended december  by comparison  our total expenses from operations have grown to million from million over the same period 
the growth in our revenues was primarily the result of increased sales to existing customers  as a result of our efforts to deepen our relationships with these clients by increasing their awareness of  and confidence in  the value of our digital marketing intelligence platform  growth in our customer base through the addition of new customers  increases in the prices of our products and services  the sales of new products to existing and new customers  growth in sales outside of the us as a result of entering into new international markets  and growth from the acquisition of m metrics 
as of december   we had  customers  compared to as of december  we sell most of our products through our direct sales force 
we established an inside sales force dedicated to selling comscore marketer  which was launched in the fourth quarter of as a result of the recent global financial crisis in the credit markets  softness in the housing markets  difficulties in the financial services sector and continuing economic uncertainties  the direction and relative strength of the us and global economies have become increasingly uncertain 
during the year ended december   we experienced a limited number of our current and potential customers ceasing  delaying or reducing renewals of existing subscriptions and purchases of new or additional services and products presumably due to the current economic downturn 
further  certain of our existing customers have exited the market due to industry consolidation and bankruptcy in connection with these challenging economic conditions 
despite this economic downturn  we continued to add net new customers during each quarter of  and our existing customers renewed their subscriptions at a rate of over based on dollars renewed in the year ended december  however  if these adverse economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the fees that we charge for subscription based products and customized projects 
we define subscription based revenues as revenues that we generate from products that we deliver to a customer on a recurring basis 
we define project revenues as revenues that we generate from customized projects that are performed for a specific customer on a non recurring basis 
we market our subscription based products  customized projects and survey services within the comscore media metrix and m metrics product families and through comscore marketing solutions 
a significant characteristic of our business model is our large percentage of subscription based contracts 
subscription based revenues accounted for of our total revenues in and decreased to of total revenues in primarily due to the acquisition of surveysite 
subscription based revenues increased to of total revenues in  to in and to of total revenues during the year ended december  many of our customers who initially purchased a customized project have subsequently purchased one of our subscription based products 
similarly  many of our subscription based customers have subsequently purchased additional customized projects 
historically  we have generated most of our revenues from the sale and delivery of our products to companies and organizations located within the united states 
we intend to expand our international revenues by selling our products and deploying our direct sales force model in additional international markets in the future 
for the year ended december   our international revenues were million  an increase of million  or  compared to international revenues comprised approximately  and of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december  and and   respectively 
we anticipate that revenues from our us customers will continue to constitute the substantial majority of our revenues  but we expect that revenues from customers outside of the us will increase as a percentage of total revenues as we build greater international recognition of our brand and expand our sales operations globally 
subscription revenues we generate a significant proportion of our subscription based revenues from our media metrix product family 
products within the media metrix family include media metrix  plan metrix  world metrix  video metrix and ad metrix 
these product offerings provide subscribers with intelligence on digital media usage  audience characteristics  audience demographics and online and offline purchasing behavior 
customers who subscribe to our media metrix products are provided with login ids to our web site  have access to our database and can generate reports at anytime 
we also generate subscription based revenues from certain reports and analyses provided through comscore marketing solutions  if that work is procured by customers for at least a nine month period and the customer enters into an agreement to continue or extend the work 
through our marketing solutions products  we deliver digital marketing intelligence relating to specific industries  such as automotive  consumer packaged goods  entertainment  financial services  media  pharmaceutical  retail  technology  telecommunications and travel 
this marketing intelligence leverages our global consumer panel and extensive database to deliver information unique to a particular customer s needs on a recurring schedule  as well as on a continual access basis 
our marketing solutions customer agreements typically include a fixed fee with an initial term of at least one year 
we also provide these products on a non subscription basis as described under project revenues below 
in addition  we generate subscription based revenues from survey products that we sell to our customers 
in conducting our surveys  we generally use our global internet user panel 
after questionnaires are distributed to the panel members and completed  we compile their responses and then deliver our findings to the customer  who also has ongoing access to the survey response data as they are compiled and updated over time 
these data include responses and information collected from the actual survey questionnaire and can also include behavioral information that we passively collect from our panelists 
if a customer contractually commits to having a survey conducted on a recurring basis  we classify the revenues generated from such survey products as subscription based revenues 
our contracts for survey services typically include a fixed fee with terms that range from two months to one year 
project revenues we generate project revenues by providing customized information reports to our customers on a nonrecurring basis through comscore marketing solutions 
for example  a customer in the media industry might request a custom report that profiles the behavior of the customer s active online users and contrasts their market share and loyalty with similar metrics for a competitor s online user base 
if this customer continues to request the report beyond an initial project term of at least nine months and enters into an agreement to purchase the report on a recurring basis  we begin to classify these future revenues as subscription based 
in the second quarter of  we launched campaign metrix  a suite of products that enables our customers to measure their return on investment from their investment in digital marketing campaigns and that we believe will help their revenue growth 
in  we also launched brand metrix  which shows customers the test compared to control effectiveness of a campaign using survey based metrics that we collect for our ad recruit technology 
project revenues from campaign metrix and brand metrix will be generated when a customer accesses or downloads a report through our web site 
pricing for our campaign metrix and brand metrix products are presently based on the scope of the information provided in the report generated by the customer 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met prior to revenue recognition i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generate revenues by providing access to our online database or delivering information obtained from our database  usually in the form of periodic reports 
revenues are typically recognized on a straight line basis over the period in which access to data or reports are provided  which generally ranges from three to months 
we also generate revenues through survey services under contracts ranging in term from two months to one year 
our survey services consist of survey and questionnaire design with subsequent data collection  analysis and reporting 
we recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the estimated data collection period once the survey or questionnaire design has been delivered 
any change in the estimated data collection period results in an adjustment to revenues recognized in future periods 
certain of our arrangements contain multiple elements  consisting of the various services we offer 
multiple element arrangements typically consist of a subscription to our online database combined with customized services 
these arrangements are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we have determined that there is not objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any of our services and  therefore  account for all elements in multiple elements arrangements as a single unit of accounting 
access to data under the subscription element is generally provided shortly after the execution of the contract 
however  the initial delivery of customized services generally occurs subsequent to contract execution 
we recognize the entire arrangement fee over the performance period of the last deliverable 
as a result  the total arrangement fee is recognized on a straight line basis over the period beginning with the commencement of the last customized service delivered 
generally  our contracts are non refundable and non cancelable 
in the event a portion of a contract is refundable  revenue recognition is delayed until the refund provisions lapse 
a limited number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing us with written notice of cancellation 
in the event that a customer cancels its contract  it is not entitled to a refund for prior services  and it will be charged for costs incurred plus services performed up to the cancellation date 
advance payments are recorded as deferred revenues until services are delivered or obligations are met and revenue can be recognized 
deferred revenues represent the excess of amounts invoiced over amounts recognized as revenues 
fair value measurements as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  sfas no 
establishes a three tier value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly  level unobservable inputs of which there is little or no market data  which require the company to develop its own assumptions 
this hierarchy requires the use of observable market data  when available  and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value 
on a recurring basis  we measure our marketable securities at fair value and determine the appropriate classification level for each reporting period 
this determination requires significant judgments to be made by us 
our investment instruments are classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy 
level investment instruments are valued using quoted market prices 
level instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model that takes into consideration the securities coupon rate  the financial condition of the issuers and the bond insurers  the expected date liquidity will be restored  as well as an applied illiquidity discount 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include most us government and agency securities 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the types of instruments valued based on significant unobservable inputs include certain illiquid auction rate securities 
such instruments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
goodwill and intangible assets we record goodwill and intangible assets when we acquire other businesses 
the allocation of acquisition costs to intangible assets and goodwill involves the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions  and the result of the allocation process can have a significant impact on our future operating results 
we estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired using several different valuation approaches  including the replacement cost  income and market approaches 
the replacement cost approach is based on determining the discrete cost of replacing or reproducing a specific asset 
we generally use the replacement cost approach for estimating the value of acquired technology methodology assets 
the income approach converts the anticipated economic benefits that we assume will be realized from a given asset into value 
under this approach  value is measured as the present worth of anticipated future net cash flows generated by an asset 
we generally use the income approach to value customer relationship assets and non compete agreements 
the market approach compares the acquired asset to similar assets that have been sold 
we generally use the market approach to value trademarks and brand assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives while goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized  but rather are periodically tested for impairment 
an impairment review generally requires developing assumptions and projections regarding our operating performance 
in accordance with sfas  we have determined that all of our goodwill is associated with one reporting unit as we do not operate separate lines of business with respect to our services 
accordingly  on an annual basis we perform the impairment assessment for goodwill required under sfas at the enterprise level by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill recorded by the reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  impairment is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets  which could be material 
long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if an indication of impairment is present  we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying amount 
recoverability measurement and estimation of undiscounted cash flows are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
there were no impairment charges recognized during the years ended december    or allowance for doubtful accounts we manage credit risk on accounts receivable by performing credit evaluations of our customers for existing customers coming up for renewal as well as all prospective new customers  by reviewing our accounts and contracts and by providing appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts 
allowances are based on management s judgment  which considers historical experience and specific knowledge of accounts that may not be collectible 
we make provisions based on our historical bad debt experience  a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and an assessment of general economic conditions 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our tax liability through calculations we perform for the determination of our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset  we consider factors such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to adjust the net carrying value of such assets 
as of december   we had both federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in for federal and begin to expire in for state income tax reporting purposes 
in addition  at december   we had an aggregate net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes related to our foreign subsidiaries of million which begin to expire in as of december  and  we had valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
at december   the valuation allowance related principally to net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the remaining valuation allowance relates to the acquired deferred tax assets of our m metrics uk subsidiary and the deferred tax asset related to the impairment recorded on our marketable securities in the us we record a valuation allowance when we determine  based on available positive and negative evidence  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we determine the realizability of our deferred tax assets primarily based on projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in evaluating such projections  we consider our history of profitability  the competitive environment  the overall outlook for the online marketing industry and general economic conditions 
in addition  we consider the timeframe over which it would take to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration 
as of december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of our us deferred tax assets would be realized in subsequent years and that a reduction of our valuation allowance was necessary 
considering our relatively limited history of profitability and the fact that the online marketing industry is a young and developing industry  we concluded that it was appropriate to consider future taxable income for a limited period of one year into the future 
as a result  we recorded a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
as of december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that a substantial portion of our us deferred tax assets and deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions would be realized and that a further reduction of our valuation allowance was necessary 
in making that determination  we considered the profitability achieved during  the successful integration of m metrics into the base business  and the continued maturity of the online marketing industry  balanced against the current overall economic environment 
as a result  we recorded a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
the exercise of stock options during and generated income tax deductions equal to the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based compensation sfas no 
r  we will not recognize a deferred tax asset with respect to the excess stock compensation deductions until those deductions actually reduce our income tax liability 
as such  we have not recorded a deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses resulting from the exercise of these stock options in the accompanying financial statements 
at such time as we utilize these net operating losses to reduce income tax payable  the tax benefit will be recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax provisions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure and transition  and explicitly excludes income taxes from the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and was adopted by us on january  as of the adoption date of fin on january   we did not have any material gross unrecognized tax benefits 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of  on a tax affected basis 
we or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions 
for income tax returns filed by us  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before  although carryforward tax attributes that were generated prior to may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if they either have been or will be utilized 
it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
stock based compensation through december   as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we applied the intrinsic value method for accounting for stock based compensation as set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
for purposes of the pro forma disclosures required under sfas  we used the minimum value method to estimate the fair value of our stock based awards 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  under sfas r  a non public company that previously used the minimum value method for pro forma disclosure purposes is required to adopt the standard using the prospective method 
under the prospective method  all awards granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption are accounted for using the measurement  recognition and attribution provisions of sfas r 
as a result  stock based awards granted prior to the date of adoption of sfas r will continue to be accounted for under apb with no recognition of stock based compensation in future periods  unless such awards are modified or settled 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas r  we estimate the fair value of our stock based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes model requires a number of complex and subjective variables 
one key input into the model is the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
prior to our initial public offering  our board of directors estimated the fair value of our common stock for the purpose of determining stock based compensation expense 
our board utilized valuation methodologies commonly used in the valuation of private company equity securities for purposes of estimating the fair value of our common stock 
other key variables in the black scholes option pricing model include the expected volatility of our common stock price  the expected term of the award and the risk free interest rate 
in addition  under sfas r  we are required to estimate forfeitures of unvested awards when recognizing compensation expense 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense we record may differ significantly from what we have previously recorded 
at december   total estimated unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock based awards granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we expect stock based compensation expense to increase in absolute dollars as a result of the adoption of sfas r as options that were granted at the beginning of and beyond vest 
beginning in  we made use of restricted stock awards and reduced our use of stock options as a form of stock based compensation 
the actual amount of stock based compensation expense we record in any fiscal period will depend on a number of factors  including the number of shares subject to the stock awards issued  the fair value of our common stock at the time of issuance  the expected forfeiture rate and the expected volatility of our stock price over time 
estimation of fair value of warrants on july   we adopted fasb staff position fsp 
certain of our outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our stock were subject to the requirements in fsp  which required us to classify these warrants as current liabilities and to adjust the value of these warrants to their fair value at the end of each reporting period 
we estimated the fair value of these warrants at the respective dates using the black scholes option valuation model  based on the estimated market value of the underlying stock at the valuation measurement date  the contractual term of the warrant  risk free interest rates and expected dividends on and expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock 
these estimates  especially the market value of the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock and the expected volatility  are highly judgmental 
upon the closing of our initial public offering on july   these liabilities were reclassified to stockholder s equity deficit

cost of revenues also includes data collection costs for our products  operational costs associated with our data centers  including depreciation expense associated with computer equipment  and allocated overhead 
cost of revenues increased by approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in employee salaries  benefits  and stock based compensation costs associated with an expanded workforce supporting a larger product and customer base and the additional employee costs from our acquisition of m metrics as compared to we experienced increases of approximately million in costs paid to outside service vendors and incentives to our panel members related to the development of our products during as compared to we also experienced increases in panel  data and bandwidth costs of million to support our consumer panel during as compared to cost of revenues increased as a percentage of revenues by two percentage points during the year ended december  over we attribute this increase primarily to the increased costs associated with our acquisition of m metrics 
cost of revenues increased by approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in employee salaries  benefits  and stock based compensation costs associated with an expanded workforce supporting a larger product and customer base 
we experienced an increase of  in depreciation expense related to prior purchases of network infrastructure equipment and an increase of  in data center costs to support our consumer panel and the relocation of our data centers 
cost of revenues declined as a percentage of revenues by percentage points during over this decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues as described above and a moderation of the increase in costs to build and maintain our panel 
in addition  the headcount and costs associated with our technology staff grew at a lower rate than our growth in revenues 
we expect cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollar amounts as we seek to grow our business but vary as a percentage of revenues depending on whether we benefit from investments in our panel and network infrastructure and benefit from the synergies resulting from the integration of m metrics for our panel recruiting activities

all selling and marketing costs are expensed as they are incurred

in the case of multi year agreements  one year of commissions is paid initially  with the remaining amounts paid at the beginning of the succeeding years 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in employee salaries  benefits and related costs associated with an increase in account management personnel for our sales force  the formation of our product management team  our expansion in foreign markets  our acquisition of m metrics and an increase in commission and bonus costs associated with increased revenues

the inclusion of the operations of m metrics beginning in may contributed to the increase in selling and marketing expenses during the year ended december   however  a portion of these costs are attributed to one time integration costs associated with employees that are not expected to continue service or that have already been terminated

selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in also due primarily to the opening of a new sales office in tokyo  japan  our first commercial presence in asia 
additionally  the recruitment of additional sales force lags behind revenue productivity as the incremental sales force is integrated into our business and gains a better understanding of our products and territories 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollar amounts as we continue to grow our selling and marketing efforts but to vary in future periods as a percentage of revenues depending on whether we benefit from increased productivity in our sales force and from increased revenues resulting in part from our ongoing marketing initiatives

interest income  net interest income consists primarily of interest earned from investments  such as short and long term fixed income securities and auction rate securities  and our cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest expense is incurred due to capital leases pursuant to several equipment loan and security agreements and a line of credit that we have entered into in order to finance the lease of various hardware and other equipment purchases 
our capital lease obligations are secured by a senior security interest in eligible equipment 
interest income  net for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of  during was due to lower interest rates earned on our investments than those available in the prior year period and a smaller average cash balance due to the use of cash in mid for the acquisition of m metrics

we also continued to reduce the outstanding balance on our outstanding capital lease obligations

there was no comparable charge in the prior year

provision for income taxes as of december   we had both federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in for federal and begin to expire in for state income tax reporting purposes 
in the future  we intend to utilize any carryforwards available to us to reduce our tax payments 
a portion of our acquired m metrics net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under section of the internal revenue code 
we do not expect that this limitation will impact our ability to utilize all of our net operating losses prior to their expiration 
during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million due primarily to the release of the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets compared to a benefit of million in the same period in in which we recorded valuation allowance release of million

net proceeds were million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs 
our principal uses of cash historically have consisted of payroll and other operating expenses and payments related to the purchase of equipment primarily to support our consumer panel and technical infrastructure required to support our customer base 
since the beginning of  we have purchased over million in property and equipment  exclusive of million of property and equipment funded through landlord allowances received in connection with our new chicago  reston and san francisco office leases  made million in principal payments on capital lease obligations  and spent million as the cash component of consideration paid for acquisitions 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
as of december   we held million in long term investments consisting of million in auction rate securities and  in other long term fixed income securities 
in prior years we invested in these auction rate securities for short periods of time as part of our investment policy 
however  the uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
accordingly  we still hold these long term securities and are due interest at a higher rate than similar securities for which auctions have cleared 
none of these investments are mortgage backed securities or collateralized debt obligations 
as of december   certain of these investments were fully backed by investment grade and below investment grade bonds and are insured against loss of principal and interest by bond insurers whose ratings are under review and have been downgraded in some cases 
these securities were valued using a discounted cash flow model that takes into consideration the financial condition of the issuers and the bond insurers as well as the expected date liquidity will be restored 
as of december   based on the valuation models and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we have concluded that all of our investments in auction rate securities have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
accordingly  we have recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to these securities 
if the credit ratings of the issuer  the bond insurers or the collateral continue to deteriorate  we may further adjust the carrying value of these investments 
we are uncertain as to when the liquidity issues relating to these investments will improve 
accordingly  we classified these securities as long term 
operating activities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth in our business  increases in the number of customers using our products and the amount and timing of payments made by these customers

investing activities our primary regularly recurring investing activities have consisted of purchases of computer network equipment to support our internet user panel and maintenance of our database  furniture and equipment to support our operations  purchases and sales of marketable securities  and payments related to the acquisition of several companies 
as our customer base continues to expand  we expect purchases of technical infrastructure equipment to grow in absolute dollars 
the extent of these investments will be affected by our ability to expand relationships with existing customers  grow our customer base  introduce new digital formats and increase our international presence 
we used million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended december  we used million  net of cash acquired  to purchase m metrics

we used million of net cash in investing activities during  a net million of which was used to purchase short term investments  million of which was used to purchase property and equipment and  of which was used to pay contingent considerations associated with our q acquisition 
we expect to achieve greater economies of scale and operating leverage as we expand our customer base and utilize our internet user panel and technical infrastructure more efficiently 
while we anticipate that it will be necessary for us to continue to invest in our internet user panel  technical infrastructure and technical personnel to support the combination of an increased customer base  new products  international expansion and new digital market intelligence formats  we believe that these investment requirements will be less than the revenue growth generated by these actions 
this should result in a lower rate of growth in our capital expenditures to support our technical infrastructure 
in any given period  the timing of our incremental capital expenditure requirements could impact our cost of revenues  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
financing activities our primary financing activities from until mid consisted of financings to fund the acquisition of capital assets 
we entered into an equipment lease agreement with ge capital in and a line of credit agreement with ge capital in  both of which were paid in full in  to finance the purchase of hardware and other computer equipment to support our business growth 
these borrowings were secured by a senior security interest in the equipment acquired under the facility 
in december  we entered into an equipment lease agreement with banc of america leasing capital  llc to finance the purchase of new hardware and other computer equipment as we continue to expand our technology infrastructure in support of our business growth

we used million of cash during the year ended december  for financing activities 
this included million for shares repurchased by us pursuant to the exercise by stock incentive plan participants of their right to elect to use common stock to satisfy their tax withholding obligations 
in addition we used  to make payments on our capital lease obligations offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of our common stock options and warrants we generated million of cash during the year ended december  from financing activities

we finance the purchase of some of our computer equipment under a capital lease arrangement over a period of months 
our purchase obligations relate to outstanding orders to purchase computer equipment and are typically small  they do not materially impact our overall liquidity 
on march   the company opened a million revolving line of credit with an interest rate equal to bba libor rate plus an applicable margin 
this line of credit includes no restrictive financial covenants 
on february  the line of credit was extended through april  as of december   no amounts were borrowed against the line of credit and million of letters of credit were outstanding  leaving  available for additional letters of credit or other borrowings 
these letters of credit may be reduced periodically provided we meet the conditional criteria of each related lease agreement 
during the year ended december   one letter of credit was reduced by approximately  we have used million of a million line of credit that was available to us until december  to establish an equipment lease for the amount of approximately million bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
the line of credit expired on december  future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  we expect that the net proceeds from our ipo will provide us with the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives  including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments 
our ability to generate cash  however  is subject to our performance  general economic conditions  industry trends and other factors 
to the extent that funds from our ipo  combined with existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes or have any derivative financial instruments 
to date  most payments made under our contracts are denominated in us dollars  and we have not experienced material gains or losses as a result of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as of december   our cash reserves were maintained in bank deposit accounts  certificates of deposit  treasury bills  treasury notes  and auction rate securities totaling million 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to experience any material adverse impact in income or cash flow 
foreign currency risk a portion of our revenues and expenses from business operations in foreign countries are derived from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operations in those countries 
as such  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and operating expenses of our foreign operations  but we believe this exposure to be immaterial at this time 
as such  we do not currently engage in any transactions that hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk 
as we grow our international operations  our exposure to foreign currency risk has become and will continue to be more significant 
interest rate sensitivity as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments of million 
these amounts were invested primarily in certificates of deposit  us treasury bills and us treasury notes 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates changed by during the year ended december   our interest exposure would have been approximately  assuming consistent investment levels 
auction rate securities as of december   we held million in long term investments consisting of million in auction rate securities and  in us treasury notes

however  the uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
accordingly  we still hold these long term securities and are due interest at a higher rate than similar securities for which auctions have cleared 
none of these investments are mortgage backed securities or collateralized debt obligations 
as of december   certain of these investments were fully backed by bonds with ratings ranging from a to b and were insured against loss of principal and interest by bond insurers whose ratings range from bbb to c however  as of december  and december   five auction rate securities with a par value of million had failed their most recent auction and are considered illiquid 
as of december   we have recognized an impairment charge of approximately million concluding that the decline in value of these five securities is other than temporary 
these securities were valued using a discounted cash flow model that takes into consideration the securities coupon rate  the financial condition of the issuers and the bond insurers  the expected date liquidity will be restored  as well as an applied illiquidity discount 
as of december   based on the valuation models and an analysis of the other than temporary impairment factors we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to our auction rate securities 
if the credit ratings of the issuer  the bond insurers or the collateral continue to deteriorate  we may further adjust the carrying value of these investments 
we are uncertain as to when the liquidity issues relating to these investments will improve 
accordingly  we classified these securities as long term as of december  and december
