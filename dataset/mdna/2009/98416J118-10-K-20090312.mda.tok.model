item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the section titled risk factors  the consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
recent developments new york stock exchange as previously disclosed in our press release dated january   we were notified by nyse regulation  inc on december  that we were not in compliance with the continued listing criteria of the nyse  under sections b and c of the nyse listed company manual 
specifically  the nyse considers us to be below these criteria because i the average closing price of our common stock was less than per share over a consecutive trading day period  and ii our average total market capitalization was less than million over the same period and our most recently reported stockholders equity was less than million 
under applicable nyse rules  we have days from the receipt of the notice to submit a plan advising the nyse of definitive actions we have taken  or propose to take  that we believe will bring us into compliance with the market capitalization listing standards within months of receipt of the letter 
we submitted such a plan on february  it is currently undergoing review by the nyse 
within days of receiving the plan  the nyse will inform us in writing as to whether it has accepted or rejected our plan 
if our plan is rejected  our common stock will be subject to suspension and delisting by the nyse 
additionally  since we are below the share price criterion  we must bring our share price and day average share price above within the longer of six months of receipt of the notification or our next annual meeting of stockholders if stockholder action is proposed 
during this time  our common shares will continue to be listed on the nyse  subject to our compliance with other nyse continued listing standards but will be assigned a 
bc suffix by the nyse to signify that we are not currently in compliance with the nyse continued listing standards 
if we are not compliant with the continued listing standards within the applicable timeframe  our common stock will be subject to suspension and delisting by the nyse 
on february   the nyse submitted to the securities exchange commission an immediately effective rule filing which suspends the nyse s minimum price requirement on a temporary basis  initially through june  further  the filing also extends until the same date the nyse s current easing of the average global market capitalization standard from million to million 
while the filing is immediately effective  it is subject to a day operative delay 
the nyse has asked the sec to waive this operative delay and expects the sec to do so promptly 
the following describes how the suspension of the minimum price requirement will operate in practice companies currently below the minimum price criteria that do not regain compliance during the suspension period will recommence their compliance period upon reinstitution of the stock price continued listing standard and receive the remaining balance of their compliance period 
companies currently below the minimum price criteria will be deemed to have regained compliance during the rule suspension period if at the end of their respective six month cure period  as established prior to this rule s suspension  they have a closing share price on both the last trading day of the period and based on the preceding trading days  and or at the end of any calendar month during the suspension they have a closing share price on both the last trading day of such month and based on the trading days preceding the end of such month 

table of contents global economic environment our operations are highly dependent upon the paper production industry and the degree to which the paper industry is affected by global economic conditions and the availability of credit 
demand for our products  could decline if paper manufacturers are unable to obtain required financing or if the economic crisis causes additional mill closures 
for example  in the quarter ended september  and december   due to the global economic crisis and the lack of credit availability which may affect our customers demand for products and their ability to pay their debts  we assessed the impact of this crisis on our customers and our industry  and changed our estimates of net realizable value of receivables and inventories 
two of our major customers  who collectively represent approximately of revenues  have had recent financial difficulties 
one of them filed for bankruptcy protection in january and we believe the other may be facing liquidity issues and potential credit refinancing during we have fully reserved for amounts due from these customers  however  decreases in orders from these customers or future payment problems from these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
during  especially the latter part of the year  the global paper industry experienced a sharp reduction in production levels  caused by the general slowdown in economic activity and related paper consumption during the same period 
the slowdown of production was across all grades of paper production  but most notably in the packaging grades and newsprint 
for packaging grades  the demand for these grades is directly related to broad manufacturing and transportation activity reduction  while newsprint demand has been increasingly declining over a number of years due to the greater prevalence of electronic media  exacerbated in recent months by reduction in print advertising 
one of the results of the recent reduction in demand for paper products is that the inventory of paper at the paper makers has increased significantly and production slowdowns  curtailments and idling of paper making machines have been occurring at a sharply increasing rate since october and are continuing into regionally  north america and europe have seen the more significant production declines and paper production decreased in and is expected to decrease further in  while south america and asia  while experiencing slowdowns  are still expected to increase tons of paper produced in compared to while xerium was successful in reducing the rate of price decrease in for the products we sell to the paper makers  there continues to be price pressure due to our competitors pursuing market growth with slower overall demand for our products 
during the third quarter of  we also took steps to reduce our expenses and obligations in light of the challenging economic climate 
specifically  we froze benefit pension accruals under our pension plan for us salaried and non union hourly employees  the pension plan  effective december  so that future service beyond december  will no longer be credited under the pension plan 
employees who are vested as of december  will be entitled to their benefit earned as of december  employees who were not vested as of december  will be entitled to their benefit earned as of december  upon five years of continuous employment from date of hire 
we also curtailed sponsoring or funding  as of december   our us retiree health insurance program under which we offered health care benefits to a certain group of retired us employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries 
while we originally announced an increase in our k plan match in the united states from of eligible compensation to as of january   we announced after january  that we will not implement this increase and instead will eliminate the employer match until further notice 
as a result of the decision to freeze benefits under the pension plan and to terminate sponsorship of our us retiree health insurance program  in accordance with the applicable accounting literature  we recorded the following i pre tax curtailment settlement gains of million in our income statement during the quarter ended september   ii a decrease in our pension and postretirement liability of million as of september  and iii a charge to other comprehensive income of million 
the above amounts also include a loss of million as a result of the settlement of one of our canadian pension plans 
our credit facility requires that we meet certain operating requirements and financial ratios in order to avoid a default or event of default under the facility 
see credit facility below in this section 
although we expected we would generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service the debt under the credit facility prior to the 
table of contents stated maturity of the debt if there were not otherwise an event of default and acceleration of the maturity of the debt  we did not satisfy our leverage ratio covenant for the period ended march  that was in effect under our then existing credit agreement 
failure to satisfy the covenant would constitute a default under our credit facility absent a waiver from our lenders 
our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements related to the uncertainty in our ability to continue as a going concern 
the inclusion of that paragraph in its report would also constitute a default under our credit facility absent a waiver 
on april   we obtained a temporary waiver from the lenders for these defaults 
the waiver was in effect until may  on may   prior to the expiration of the waiver  we entered in to an amendment and restatement of the credit agreement governing our credit facility 
as a result of this amendment and restatement  on august   our independent registered public accounting firm reissued its report relating to our financial statements as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  to remove the explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern and to insert an emphasis paragraph that the conditions that raised substantial doubt about whether we will continue as a going concern no longer exist 
overview we are a leading global manufacturer and supplier of two types of consumable products used primarily in the production of paper clothing and roll covers 
our operations are strategically located in the major paper producing regions of north america  europe  south america and asia pacific 
our products play key roles in the formation and processing of paper along the length of a paper making machine 
paper producers rely on our products and services to help improve the quality of their paper  differentiate their paper products  operate their paper making machines more efficiently and reduce production costs 
our products and services typically represent only a small fraction of a paper producer s overall production costs  yet they reduce costs by permitting the use of lower cost raw materials and reducing energy consumption 
paper producers must replace clothing and refurbish or replace roll covers regularly as these products wear down during the paper production process 
our products are designed to withstand extreme temperature  chemical and pressure conditions  and are the result of a substantial investment in research and development and highly sophisticated manufacturing processes 
we operate in two principal business segments clothing and roll covers 
in our clothing segment  we manufacture and sell highly engineered synthetic textile belts that transport paper as it is processed on a paper making machine 
clothing plays a significant role in the forming  pressing and drying stages of paper production 
because paper making processes and machine specifications vary widely  the clothing size  form  material and function is selected to fit each individual paper making machine and process 
in  our clothing segment represented of our net sales 
our roll cover products provide a surface with the mechanical properties necessary to process the paper sheet in a cost effective manner that delivers the sheet qualities desired by the paper producer 
roll covers are tailored to each individual paper making machine and process  using different materials  treatments and finishings 
in addition to manufacturing and selling new roll covers  we also provide refurbishment services for previously installed roll covers and manufacture spreader rolls 
additionally  we provide various related products and services to our customers  both directly and through third party providers  as a growing part of our overall product offering through our roll covers sales channels 
in  our roll cover segment represented of our net sales 
in  sales in other industrial applications outside of the paper industry  such as steel  plastics and textiles  accounted for approximately and of the net sales in our clothing segment and roll covers segment  respectively 

table of contents industry trends and outlook historically  demand for our products has been driven primarily by the volume of paper produced on a worldwide basis 
according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations  the volume of paper productions between and increased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
risi  the leading information provider for the global forest products industry  expects the growth of global paper production from to to be slightly more than per annum  although in certain periods the growth of global paper production may be higher or lower 
there is also the possibility that paper production may decline in any specific period compared to prior periods 
generally  and over time  we expect growth in paper production to be greater in asia  south america and eastern europe than in the more mature north american and western european regions 
the profitability of paper producers has historically been highly cyclical due to wide swings in the price of paper  driven to a high degree by the oversupply of paper during periods when paper producers have more aggregate capacity than the market requires 
a sustained downturn in the paper industry  either globally or in a particular region  can cause paper manufacturers to reduce production or cease operations  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
since  paper producers have taken actions that seek to structurally improve the balance between the supply of and demand for paper 
as part of these efforts  they have shut down many paper making machines 
between and the bulk of these closures occurred in north america 
announcements by paper producers concerning temporary and permanent shutdowns of paper making machines in both north america and europe have continued 
during through  the sales and profitability of our north american and european operations were adversely affected by these shutdowns 
papermakers continue to experience low levels of profitability  and we believe that further consolidation among papermakers  reducing the number of paper producers  and shutdowns of paper making machines will occur in europe and north america  until there is a better balance between supply and demand for paper and the profit levels of paper producers improve 
over a number of years  consumption growth of paper is expected to drive an increase in the global production rates required to maintain balance between supply and demand although it is likely that a consumption slow down and related effect on global paper production will occur in the near term 
global paper production growth that does occur would be moderated by the level of industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity that is a continuing underlying trend in north america and western europe 
we also believe that  in addition to industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity in north america and western europe  the trend towards new paper machine designs which have fewer rolls and market recognition of extended life of our roll cover products has been and will continue to negatively impact demand for these products and that the volume potential for the roll covers business in north america and western europe will slowly diminish 
additionally  we are seeing a trend that paper producers are placing an increasing emphasis on maintenance cost reduction and  as a result  are extending the life of roll covers through additional maintenance cycles before replacing them 
accordingly  in november  we acquired two roll cover manufacturing plants in china to expand our served market  and are now focused on adding related products and services to our offerings in this new territory 
we anticipate that pricing pressure for our products will continue with the consolidation among paper producers and as the shift of paper production growth in asia develops 
in response to this pricing pressure  we expect to increase our expenditure levels on research and development expenses and continue to develop our value added selling approach as part of our strategy to differentiate our products  while at the same time remaining focused on cost reduction and efficiency programs 
our operations are highly dependent upon the paper production industry and the degree to which the paper industry is affected by global economic conditions and the availability of credit 
the global economic crisis and the lack of credit availability may affect our customers demand for products and their ability to pay their debts 
for example  two of our major customers  who collectively represent approximately of revenues  have had recent financial difficulties 
one of them filed for bankruptcy protection in january and we believe the 
table of contents other may be facing liquidity issues and potential credit refinancing during we have fully reserved for amounts due from these customers  however  decreases in orders from these customers or future payment problems from these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
sales and expenses sales in both our clothing and roll covers segments are primarily driven by the following factors the volume of worldwide paper production  advances in the technology of our products  which can provide value to our customers by improving the efficiency of paper making machines  and our ability to provide products and services which reduce paper making machine downtime  while at the same time allowing the manufacture of high quality paper products 
impact of currency fluctuations 
sales in our roll covers segment include our mechanical services business 
we have expanded this business in response to demand from paper producers that we perform work on the internal mechanisms of a roll while we refurbish or replace a roll cover 
in our clothing segment  a small portion of our business has been conducted pursuant to consignment arrangements under which we do not recognize a sale of a product to a customer until the customer places the product into use  which typically occurs some period after the product is shipped to the customer or to a warehouse location near the customer s facility 
we are striving to reduce the number of consignment arrangements and increase the use of standard terms of sale under which we recognize a sale upon product shipment 
we expect this effort to be successful over several years 
our operating costs are driven primarily by our total sales volume  the impact of inflation and currency and the level and impact of cost reduction programs 
the level of our cost of products sold is primarily attributable to labor costs  raw material costs  product shipping costs  plant utilization and depreciation  with labor costs constituting the largest component 
we invest in facilities and equipment that enable innovative product development and improve production efficiency and costs 
recent examples of capital spending for such purposes include faster weaving looms and seaming machines with accurate electronic controls  automated compound mixing equipment and computer controlled lathes and mills 
the level of research and development spending is driven by market demand for technology enhancements  including both specific customer needs and general market requirements  as well as by our own analysis of applied technology opportunities 
with the exception of purchases of equipment and similar capital items used in our research and development activities  all research and development is expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreign exchange we have a geographically diverse customer base 
in  approximately of our sales was in north america  was in europe  was in south america  was in asia pacific and was in the rest of the world 
a substantial portion of our sales is denominated in euros or other currencies 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies affect our reported levels of revenues and profitability as the results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
in particular  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the euro and these other currencies positively impact our levels of revenue and profitability because the translation of a certain number of euros or units of such other currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes will represent more us dollars 

table of contents for certain transactions  our sales are denominated in us dollars or euros but all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in a different currency 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies can affect the level of the profitability of these transactions 
the largest proportion of such transactions consist of transactions in which the sales are denominated in or indexed to us dollars and all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in euros  reals or other currencies 
currency fluctuations have a greater effect on the level of our net sales than on the level of our income loss from operations 
for example  in as compared to  the change in the value of the us dollar against most of the currencies we conduct our business in resulted in currency translation increases in net sales and income from operations of million and million  respectively 
although the results reflect a period in which the value of the us dollar decreased as compared to  we would expect an opposite effect in a period in which the value of the us dollar increases 
during  we conducted business in foreign currencies 
the following table provides the average exchange rate in and of the us dollar against each of the five foreign currencies in which we conduct the largest portion of our operations  and indicates the percentage of our net sales in and denominated in each such foreign currency 
currency average exchange rate of the us dollar in average exchange rate of the us dollar in euro euro euro brazilian real brazilian real brazilian real canadian dollar canadian dollar canadian dollar australian dollar australian dollar australian dollar british pound british pound british pound currency percentage of net sales denominated in such currency percentage of net sales denominated in such currency euro brazilian real canadian dollar australian dollar british pound to mitigate the risk of transactions in which a sale is made in one currency and associated costs are denominated in a different currency  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain that results from the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedge strategy 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
cost reduction programs an important part of our strategy is to seek to reduce our overall costs and improve our competitiveness 
as a part of this effort  we have engaged in a series of cost reduction programs since  which were designed to improve the cost structure of our operations in north america  south america and europe  in response to changing market conditions 
these cost reduction programs include headcount reductions throughout the world as well as plant closures that have rationalized production among our facilities to better enable us to meet customer demands 

table of contents our cost reduction efforts between and included the closing of twelve manufacturing facilities and the movement of certain production from two other facilities 
five facilities were closed in the clothing segment  of which three were in north america  one was in the united kingdom and one in australia we committed in to complete the closing of our manufacturing facility in australia in the first quarter of 
we closed seven facilities in the rolls segment  four of which were in north america includes sherbrooke canada  the closing of which we announced in  and which facility was still performing manufacturing operations as of december  and has ceased such operations in early  two were in the united kingdom and one in europe 
from to  we eliminated approximately positions in connection with our cost reduction efforts 
as a result of these actions  offset by other changes in workforce  our headcount decreased by approximately positions during that period 
in  we charged a total of million for restructuring and impairments related expense of which i million related to the reorganization of our european management structure along functional lines  ii million related to impaired assets  primarily in the united kingdom  as discussed below and iii million related to the closures of facilities under restructuring programs that were commenced prior to in  we charged a total of million for restructuring and impairments related expense as follows i in march  we ceased manufacturing activity at our roll covers manufacturing facility in the united kingdom and recorded restructuring expenses of million related thereto 
we had recorded asset impairment charges of million related to this facility during the fourth quarter of  ii in the first quarter of  the company also initiated the closure of a roll covers manufacturing facility in the us for which restructuring expenses and asset impairments of million and million  respectively  were recorded during and iii during the first quarter of  we initiated a program to streamline our operating structure for which restructuring expenses of million were recorded during in  we charged a total of million for restructuring and impairments related expense as follows i the streamlining of our operating structure continued during  for which we recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december   ii the closing of our roll covers manufacturing facility in sherbrooke  canada and the closing our roll covers manufacturing facility in sweden and transferring production to our other roll covers manufacturing facilities in europe were both announced during the second quarter of for which we recorded restructuring and impairment expenses of million during the year ended december   iii our commitment to a plan to cease production in australia and to discontinue construction of our new vietnam facility was announced in december for which we recorded restructuring and impairment expenses of million during the fourth quarter of  and iv our evaluation of assets in the us resulted in impairment charges of million during the fourth quarter of we are targeting restructuring expenses of approximately to million during primarily related to headcount reductions resulting from the integration of the regional management structure in north america and similar actions in europe 
we expect to continue to review our business to determine if additional actions can be taken to further improve our cost structure 
in light of our assessment of the impact of the global credit crisis and the potential effect on our customers and our industry  and therefore  on our performance  additional operating structure improvements and related restructuring expenses are being analyzed

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s operations are highly dependent upon the paper production industry and the degree to which the paper industry is affected by global economic conditions and the availability of credit 
demand for our products could decline if paper manufacturers are unable to obtain required financing or if the economic slowdown causes additional mill closures 
in addition  the global economic crisis and the ensuing lack of availability of credit availability may affect our customers ability to pay their debts 
our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service 
we expect to fund our liquidity requirements primarily with cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  through borrowings under our credit facility 
we plan to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in and will use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity as well as borrowings  if necessary  under the revolving portion of the credit facility to meet normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the million decrease is principally attributable to a lower net income  after adjusting for non working capital changes  in as compared with this decrease was partially offset by the favorable working capital changes as a result of our continuing efforts to target a reduction in days sales outstanding and increases in inventory turns and days payables outstanding 
the million increase in as compared with is primarily due to working capital changes

table of contents as of december   there was a million balance of term loans outstanding under our senior credit facility 
during  we have made scheduled principal payments of million as required under the term loan  a mandatory principal repayment of million and a voluntary repayment of million 
in addition  as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving lines of credit  including the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility and lines of credit in various foreign countries that are used to facilitate local short term operating needs  and an aggregate of million available for additional borrowings under these revolving lines of credit 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures we use the term capital expenditures to refer to costs incurred to purchase property and equipment 
the majority of our capital expenditures relate to purchases of machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products 
capital expenditures were funded from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
growth capital expenditures consist of items that are intended to increase the manufacturing  production and or distribution capacity or efficiencies of our operations in conjunction with the execution of our business strategies 
maintenance capital expenditures are designed to sustain the current capacity or efficiency of our operations and include items relating to the renovation of existing manufacturing or service facilities  the purchase of machinery and equipment for safety and environmental needs and information technology 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
we expanded production capacity in brazil and began building a clothing manufacturing facility in vietnam in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of we began an effort to reduce our planned capital expenditures 
as part of this effort  we determined to delay the planned capital expenditures for the vietnam facility and cancelled or rescheduled certain other previously planned capital expenditures 
these cancellations did not result in any substantial penalties for us 
in december  we discontinued the construction of the vietnam facility 
due to our assessment of the impact of the global economic crisis and the potential effect on our customers and our industry  we are currently evaluating additional capital expenditures reductions and cost reduction actions to improve long term operating efficiencies and to better match our production with demand 
we target capital expenditures for to be approximately million  as we complete obligations undertaken as part of our vietnam initiatives and that capital expenditures in will be lower than those for we analyze our planned capital expenditures based on investment opportunities available to us and our financial and operating performance  and accordingly  actual capital expenditures may be more or less than these amounts 
see credit facility below for a description on limitations on capital expenditures imposed by our credit facility 
credit facility upon the completion of the initial public of offering of our common stock on may   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a senior secured credit facility 
the credit facility was amended four times on february   december   may  and april  the credit facility was amended and restated on may  
table of contents the description of the credit facility below describes the facility as amended and restated 
our credit facility provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility and for term loans that had a total principal amount of million as of may because the term loans include portions denominated in euros and canadian dollars  in addition to a us dollar denominated portion  the aggregate outstanding principal on our term loans is affected by our currency exchange rates as well as principal repayments 
the revolving credit facility matures on november   and the term loans mature on may  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of most of our subsidiaries  subject to legal and tax considerations and requirements 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loans bear interest at the sum of  as applicable  libor  the euribor rate or cdor plus  in each case  the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is set at through december  beginning january   the applicable margin will depend upon our credit rating level it will be if our credit rating is ba or higher by moody s and bb or higher by s p  if our credit rating is b by moody s or b by s p  if our credit rating is b or higher but lower than b by moody s and b or higher but lower than b by s p  and if our credit rating is lower than b by moody s or lower than b by s p 
in order to qualify at each level the rating must be with a stable outlook 
our current credit rating is caa by moody s and b by s p 
on september   standard poor s ratings services raised its ratings on the company  including raising the long term corporate credit rating  from ccc to b 
on november   we entered into interest rate swap arrangements which initially qualified for hedge accounting under sfas no 
as a result of the financial covenant non compliance for the period ended march  as discussed in note  the debt was potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps  and therefore  hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 
was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps 
accordingly  the mark to market changes in their fair value was recorded as a non cash credit to interest expense of million for the six month period ended june   respectively 
effective july   we were again able to assert that the hedged transactions were probable of occurring and accordingly redesignated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of benchmark interest rate risk on month libor based interest payments on the hedged debt as of june  as a result  the mark to market changes of million on these interest rate swaps were charged to accumulated other comprehensive income and the related ineffective portion charged to interest expense during the second half of was less than million 
the new interest rate swaps effectively fixed the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of our credit facility through as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the effectively fixed portion of the term loan facility was  and the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed by interest rate swap contracts  based on the day libor  was 
the credit facility provides for scheduled quarterly principal payments of the term loans as set out below currency usd euro cad first quarter only the credit facility also requires us to make additional prepayments of the term loans under the following circumstances with of the net cash proceeds received by us from any sale  transfer or other disposition of any assets excluding inventory and certain discontinued manufacturing facilities  subject to an exemption for the reinvestment of up to million of such proceeds within a year of our receipt thereof in long term productive assets of the general type used in our business  with of the net cash proceeds received by us from any insurance recovery or condemnation events  subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights and exempting the first million

prior to the effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of our credit facility  the percentage of our annual excess cash required to be prepaid was for  for and for each fiscal year thereafter 
we made mandatory principal prepayments from excess cash of million and million in the first quarters of and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we also made voluntary debt repayments of approximately million 
our credit facility requires that we observe and perform numerous affirmative and negative covenants  including certain financial covenants 
for the period ended march   we were in default of our leverage ratio covenant that was in effect prior to the amendment and restatement 
further  our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements relating to uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern  which also constituted a default under our credit facility 
as a result of the company s amendment and restatement of its senior credit facility described below  on august   the company s independent registered public accounting firm reissued its report relating to the company s financial statements as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  to remove the explanatory paragraph with respect to the company s ability to continue as a going concern and to insert an emphasis paragraph that the conditions that raised substantial doubt about whether the company will continue as a going concern no longer exist

for the four fiscal quarters ended december  our interest coverage ratio was  our fixed charge coverage ratio was and our leverage ratio was our credit facility defines consolidated capital expenditures for a particular fiscal year as all expenditures required under gaap to be included in purchase of property and equipment or similar items 
the credit facility limits the amount of our consolidated capital expenditures in any given fiscal year to an amount not exceeding million for fiscal year and million for each of fiscal years  and  exclusive of capital expenditures paid with net insurance and condemnation proceeds  provided that the maximum amount of consolidated capital expenditures permitted in each fiscal year shall be increased by of the amount below the maximum not spent in the prior fiscal year determined without reference to any carryover amount  and provided  further  that solely for fiscal year  the maximum amount that may be carried forward to fiscal year shall equal of the first million of any permitted consolidated expenditures not expended in fiscal year plus of any remaining expenditures not expended in fiscal year our credit facility also prohibits the payment of dividends on our common stock

we included million as of december  for such additional repayments that are to be made in the first quarter of in the less than year column of this table 
because the amount of any such future repayment is not currently determinable  it is excluded from this table for the periods after less than year 
interest expense shown above is based on the effective interest rate as of december  as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the effectively fixed portion of the term loan facility was and the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed  based on the day libor  was 
the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of the credit facility is effectively fixed by interest rate swap contracts through december  includes obligations with respect to raw materials purchases  repair and maintenance services  utilities and capital expenditures 
amounts in other represent future cash outflows for which we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement 
off balance sheet financing during the year ended december   we have not engaged in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have formal accounting policies in place including those that address critical and complex accounting areas 
note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report identify the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
derivatives and hedging 
we account for our derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on their balance sheets as 
table of contents either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value 
all changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met  which requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
there are two types of hedges into which we enter hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure 
hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset or liability  or a firm commitment 
hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid related to a recognized liability 
changes in derivative fair values are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the related hedged assets and liabilities 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are recorded in other comprehensive income 
we entered into interest rate swaps in november that initially qualified for hedge accounting under sfas no 
as a result of anticipated financial covenant non compliance for the period ended march   we classified as current on our balance sheet as of december  million of the long term debt under our senior credit facility 
accordingly  because this debt was potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps  hedge accounting under sfas no 
was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps and the mark to market change in their fair value was recorded as a noncash charge to interest expense of million during the fourth quarter of and a noncash credit to interest expense of million during the six months ended june  effective july   we were again able to assert that the hedged transactions were probable of occurring and accordingly redesignated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of benchmark interest rate risk on month libor based interest payments on the hedged debt as of june  as a result  the mark to market changes of million on these interest rate swaps were charged to accumulated other comprehensive income and the related ineffective portion charged to interest expense during the six months ended december  was less than million 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
for measuring our derivative assets and liabilities 
we have classified our interest rate swaps in level of the sfas no 
fair value hierarchy  as the significant inputs to the overall valuations are based on market observable data or information derived from or corroborated by market observable data  including market based inputs to models  model calibration to market clearing transactions  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
where models are used  the selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we use similar models to value similar instruments 
valuation models require a variety of inputs  including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  and correlations of such inputs 
for our derivatives  all of which trade in liquid markets  model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 
to comply with the provisions of sfas no 
 we incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of our derivatives 
the credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives which incorporates both the current and potential future exposure and then applying each counterparty s credit spread to the applicable exposure 
for derivatives with two way exposure  such as interest rate swaps  the counterparty s credit spread is applied to our exposure to the counterparty  and our own credit spread is applied to the counterparty s exposure to us  and the net credit valuation adjustment is reflected in our derivative valuations 
the total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using market observable inputs  such as yield curves and volatilities 
the inputs utilized for our own credit spread are based on implied spreads from its publicly traded debt 
for counterparties with publicly available credit information  the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third party credit data provider 
in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 
additionally  we actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for any significant changes 

table of contents although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level inputs  such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties 
however  as of december   we have assessed the net significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments reduced the settlement values of our derivative liabilities by million 
various factors impact changes in the credit are not significant to the overall valuation adjustments over time  including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts  as well as changes in market rates and volatilities  which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments 
when appropriate  valuations are also adjusted for various factors such as liquidity and bid offer spreads  which factors were deemed immaterial by us as of december  as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
we do not have any fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level as of december  financial accounting standards board fasb staff position sfas no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 permits us to defer the recognition and measurement of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until january  the adoption of sfas no 
for measuring our derivative assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in derivative liabilities of million as of december  at december   we did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value 
goodwill 
we account for acquired goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

purchase accounting required by sfas no 
involves judgment with respect to the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities in order to determine the amount of goodwill 
we believe that the estimates that we have used to record prior acquisitions are reasonable and in accordance with sfas no 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we account for acquired goodwill and goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

this pronouncement requires considerable judgment in the valuation of acquired goodwill and the ongoing evaluation of goodwill impairment 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but  instead  must be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or business conditions warrant 
we perform an annual test for goodwill impairment as of december st at the business segment level 
we have two business segments clothing and roll covers 
when our business was acquired in  more than of the goodwill was assigned to the roll covers segment based on relative fair values at the date of acquisition 
in and  segment earnings were million and million for the clothing segment  respectively  and million and million for the roll covers segment  respectively 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
step involves comparing the fair value of the company s reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount is greater than the fair value then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets  excluding goodwill  of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
for the purpose of performing the annual impairment test we allocate all shared assets and liabilities to the business segments based upon the percentage of each segment s revenue to total revenue 
shared expenses are allocated to each segment to the extent necessary to allow them to operate as independent businesses 
fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of both a market multiple approach and an income approach 

table of contents the market multiple approach utilizes our proprietary information to determine measures that are used to value our business segments 
the income approach is a present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flows produced by each business segment 
determining the fair value of a business segment or an indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions  among others 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test under sfas no 
are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
based on these assessments performed as of december   we determined that no impairment of goodwill exists 
the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for our clothing and roll covers segment as of december   the annual test date  was approximately million and million  respectively 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of these business segments  which resulted in a fair value in excess of carrying value of approximately million and million for the clothing segment and roll covers segment  respectively 
based on these assessments performed as of december   we determined that our goodwill for the roll covers segment was impaired due to expectations of lower profitability and to the increased carrying value of the net assets of the roll covers segment due primarily to currency translation effects thereon 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of million and a related tax benefit of million related to our roll covers segment 
step of the process indicated that the fair value of the net assets of the roll covers segment was million less than their carrying value as of december  based on the step result  the company proceeded with step based on the increase in fair value of tangible and intangible assets over book value of million as determined in step  an aggregate impairment of million was recorded 
there was no goodwill impairment recorded for the clothing segment during the year ended december   nor for either segment prior to the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for our clothing segment as of december  was approximately million 
contingencies 
we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax  environmental and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
our consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
while we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate  the adequacy of these reserves may change in the future due to new developments in particular matters 
in connection with the closure of certain manufacturing facilities under our restructuring programs  in  we had conducted environmental site assessments which had indicated contamination at two sites 
management believes that both sites have been substantially remediated and no significant further remediation costs are expected to be incurred 
during the third quarter of  while evaluating one of our foreign facilities  we discovered the possibility of contamination at the facility 
subsequently we had a preliminary evaluation performed  which confirmed the existence of contamination and estimated preliminary costs to clean up the facility 
based upon this evaluation  we recorded million in as our best estimate of the remediation costs we expect to incur 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and statutes that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recognized a net deferred tax liability of million at december  and million at december  the deferred taxes relate principally to pension and post retirement benefits  intangible assets and differences between the book and tax bases of property and equipment 

table of contents we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
relevant evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 
in light of our accumulated loss position in certain tax jurisdictions at december   and the uncertainty of profitability in future periods  we recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in the united states  germany  sweden and australia 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for income taxes or withholding taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to both income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various jurisdictions 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability or withholding taxes is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation  however  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards would be available to reduce some portion of the liability 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues and rely on estimates and assumptions 
these audits may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
there are currently no us federal or state audits or examinations underway 
we are currently concluding an audit relating to our german subsidiaries for tax years through there are various minor adjustments proposed for which we have established reserves in amounts sufficient to meet any assessment 
the canadian federal tax authorities contacted us in october of and have initiated an audit of our canadian companies 
the audit is still in the initial information gathering stages and no issues or assessments have been raised 
we believe that there are no other jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fas no 
fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adopted fin on january  and  accordingly  recorded a cumulative effect increase of million to accumulated deficit  an increase of million to income taxes payable and an increase of million to other long term liabilities for uncertain tax positions upon adoption 
management cannot provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of related future payments for which settlement is expected to occur beyond the next twelve months 
pension and postretirement plans 
we have various defined benefit plans and we also had an unfunded plan to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to substantially all retired us employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries 
during the third quarter of  we froze benefit pension accruals under our pension plan for us salaried and non union hourly employees the pension plan effective december  so that future service beyond december  will no longer be credited under the pension plan  and also curtailed sponsoring or funding  as of december   our us retiree health insurance 
accordingly we expect to have lower pension expense in as compared with and minimal postretirement expense after 
table of contents we use assumptions  such as expected long term return on plan assets and discount rate  to determine our pension expense 
we cannot determine whether or how much future assumptions may change 
however  as of december   a increase or decrease in the following assumptions would increase decrease pension expense  on a pre tax basis as follows in millions effect of increase in discount rate expected long term return on plan asset increase decrease to pension expense effect of decrease in discount rate expected long term return on plan asset increase decrease to pension expense new accounting standards effective january   we partially adopted sfas no 
this statement clarifies the definition of fair value  prescribes methods for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements 
we adopted this statement for our derivative assets and liabilities  which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  determined by using observable inputs of the fair value hierarchy prescribed by sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
for measuring our derivative assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in derivative assets of million as of december  see derivatives and hedging above

 permits the company to defer the recognition and measurement of its nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until january  at december   we did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 

this pronouncement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on its balance sheet  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
also requires an employer to recognize changes in its funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
we adopted the funded status provisions of sfas no 
as of december  in addition  effective for fiscal years ending on or after december   this statement requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet  with limited exceptions 
earlier application of this provision is encouraged and accordingly  we changed the september measurement date of our us pension and postretirement plans to december for the fiscal year ending december  we remeasured the plan assets and obligations of our us plans using the remeasurement method allowed under sfas no 
and  accordingly  as of january   recognized a million increase to accumulated deficit  a million decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss and a million increase to pension  other postretirement and postemployment obligations

arb no 

sfas no 
clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in consolidated statements of financial position and the accounting for  and reporting of  transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests 
under sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests are considered equity and should be reported as an element of consolidated equity 
net income will encompass the total income of all consolidated subsidiaries  and there will be separate disclosure on the face of the statement of operations of the attribution of that income between the controlling and noncontrolling interests  increases and decreases in the noncontrolling ownership interest amount will be accounted for as equity transactions 
sfas is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and earlier application is prohibited 
sfas is required to be adopted prospectively  except for reclassifying noncontrolling interests to equity  separate from the parent s shareholders equity  in the consolidated statement of financial position and recasting consolidated net income loss to include net income loss attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling interests  both of which are required to be adopted retrospectively

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging 
we have foreign currency cash flow and earnings exposure with respect to specific sale transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the unit incurring the costs associated with such transactions 
to mitigate the risks related to this exposure  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances  to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain on the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedging strategy 
in south america  substantially all of our sales are indexed to us dollars  but the associated costs are recorded in the local currencies of the operating units 
generally  we do not hedge this us dollar exposure as it would not be cost effective due to the relatively inefficient foreign exchange markets for local currencies in that region 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
the value of these contracts is recognized at fair value based on market exchange forward rates and amounted to a net liability position of million at december  these contracts mature at various dates through october relative to foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had open foreign currency exchange contracts maturing through october with total net notional amounts of approximately million 
at december   we prepared an analysis to determine the sensitivity of our forward foreign exchange contracts to changes in exchange rates 
a hypothetical adverse exchange rate movement of against our forward foreign exchange contracts would have resulted in potential net loss in fair value of these contracts of approximately million 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

interest rate hedging 
our senior credit facility has a variable interest rate 
we had entered into interest rate swap contracts effective june  pursuant to which we paid fixed rates on notional amounts while receiving the applicable floating libor rates 
these interest rate swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and the change in their fair value was subject to mark to market through earnings 
as a result of the mark to market accounting through earnings  we recorded a mark to market increase decrease to interest expense of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
although these interest rate swaps were subject to mark to market accounting through earnings  they were to have effectively fixed  from a cash flow hedge perspective  the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of the credit facility through june  we entered into interest rate swaps in november that initially qualified for hedge accounting under sfas no 
as a result of the financial covenant non compliance for the period ended march  as discussed in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  we classified as current on our balance sheet as of december  million of the long term debt under our senior credit facility 
accordingly  because the debt was potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps  hedge accounting under sfas no 
was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps 
a non cash credit of million was recorded to interest expense for the six months ended june  effective july   we were again able to assert that the hedged transactions were probable of occurring and accordingly redesignated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of benchmark interest rate risk on month libor based interest payments on the hedged debt as of june  as a result  the mark to market changes of 
table of contents million on these interest rate swaps were charged to accumulated other comprehensive income and the related ineffective portion charged to interest expense during the six months ended december  was less than million 
the interest rate swaps effectively fix  from a cash flow perspective  the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of the our credit facility through as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the effectively fixed portion of the term loan facility was  the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed by interest rate swap contracts  based on the day libor  was 
as a result of the amendment of our senior credit facility agreement on may   the applicable margin for libor term loans  libor revolving loans  euribor loans and cdor loans under our senior credit facility increased from to 
we estimate that a increase in the libor rate would increase our interest expense on the term debt by approximately million on an annual basis through december   the period covered by the interest rate swap agreements
