table of contents business overview we are a leading developer and implementer of supply chain software solutions that help organizations optimize their supply chain operations from planning through execution 
we call our portfolio of supply chain software solutions manhattan scope tm supply chain optimization from planning through execution 
built on a common supply chain process platform  scope combines planning and forecasting  inventory optimization  order lifecycle management  transportation lifecycle management and distribution management to enable full range supply chain optimization 
early in the company s history  our offerings were heavily focused on warehouse management solutions 
as the company grew in size and scope  its offerings expanded across the entire supply chain 
as a result of the company s historical beginnings however  we still enjoy significant presence in  and a relatively strong concentration of revenues from  warehouse management solutions  which are a component of our distribution management solution suite 
over time  as our non warehouse management solutions have proliferated and increased in capability  the company s revenue concentration in its management warehouse solutions has correspondingly decreased  a trend we expect to see continue 
our business model is singularly focused on the development and implementation of complex supply chain software solutions that are designed to optimize supply chain effectiveness and efficiency for our customers 
we have three principal sources of revenue license revenue generated from the sales of our supply chain software  professional services derived from implementing our solutions along with customer support services and software enhancements services  and hardware sales and other revenue 
in  we generated million in total revenue with a revenue mix of license revenues  services  and hardware and other revenue 
we manage our business based on three geographic regions americas north america and latin america  emea europe  middle east and africa  and apac asia pacific 
geographic revenue is based on the location of the sale 
our international revenue was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which represents approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
international revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
at december   we employed  employees worldwide  of which  employees are based outside the united states 
of the  international employees  approximately  or nearly employees  are located in our india development center 
we have offices in australia  china  france  india  japan  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom  as well as representatives in mexico and reseller partnerships in latin america 
global economic trends and industry factors global macro economic trends  technology spending and supply chain management market growth are important barometers for our business 
approximately of our total revenue is generated in the united states  in emea and the balance in apac  canada and latin america 
in addition  industry analysts project that approximately two thirds of every supply chain software solutions dollar invested is spent in the united states  consequently  the health of the us economy has a meaningful impact on our financial results 
according to the international monetary fund imf january  world economic outlook update weo update  world growth is projected to fall to percent in  its lowest rate since world war ii 
despite wide ranging policy actions  financial strains remain acute  pulling down the real economy 
a sustained economic recovery will not be possible until the financial sector s functionality is restored and credit markets are unclogged 
against this uncertain backdrop  output in the advanced economies is now expected to contract by percent in according to the weo update  the global economy grew in compared to in in the united states economy grew  and is projected to contract by in western europe s economy also grew in  and is forecast to shrink by in the united kingdom separately grew in and is forecast to decline by in 
table of contents the imf notes the uncertainty surrounding the weo update s outlook is unusually large as downside risks continue to dominate due to the unprecedented scale and scope of the current financial crisis 
global output and trade plummeted in the final months of  due to the continuation of the financial crisis 
the associated high level of uncertainty has prompted households and businesses to postpone expenditures  reducing demand for consumer and capital goods 
at the same time  widespread disruptions in credit are constraining household spending and curtailing production and trade 
a slowing macro economic environment impacts the timing of closing software transactions and lengthens the software sales cycles  which in turn affects our revenue and earnings per share 
in the first half of  our consolidated license revenue increased compared to growth in the first half of  while in the second half of  license revenue decreased compared to the second half of our americas license revenue for the first half of versus the first half of decreased and for the second half of declined versus the second half of as the economy worsened 
we began to see the deceleration of america s license revenue in the latter half of as second half license revenue declined compared to the prior comparable period in  largely  management believes  due to the slowing of the us economy driven by turbulence in the financial markets  the us housing market collapse and rising commodity prices 
with the current macro economic environment  we believe companies will seek to protect their balance sheets and hoard cash  which in turn will drive lower information technology spending 
according to gartner  a leading supply chain industry analyst  estimated overall information technology spending growth for in the us is projected at as of december  confirming a significant reduction to gartner s september forecast 
the company is consequently predicting the continuation of a very difficult selling environment throughout the year 
we sell technology based solutions with total pricing  including software and services  in many cases exceeding million 
reductions in the capital budgets of our customers and prospective customers could have an adverse impact on our ability to sell our solutions 
we believe that deterioration in the current business climate within the united states and geographic regions in which we operate  continued delays in capital spending  or the timing of deals closed could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to compete and is likely to further intensify in our already highly competitive markets 
revenue license revenue license revenue  a leading indicator of our business  is primarily derived from software license fees that customers pay for supply chain solutions 
in  license revenue totaled million  or of total revenue  with gross margins of 
our annual license revenue percentage mix of new to existing customers was approximately to  and over the past three years has averaged about to 
we believe our mix of new customer to existing customer license sales is well balanced  reflecting solid demand from our installed base  as well as from new customers 
license revenue growth is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products 
our license revenue generally has long sales cycles of which the timing of the closing of a few large license transactions can have a material impact on our quarterly license revenues  operating profit and earnings per share 
for example  million of license revenue in equates to approximately cents of diluted earnings per share impact 
our software solutions are singularly focused on the supply chain planning and execution markets  which are intensely competitive  rapidly consolidating and characterized by rapid technological change 
we are a market leader in the supply chain management software solutions market as defined by industry analysts such as amr  arc and gartner 
our goal is to extend our position as a leading global supply chain solutions provider by growing our license revenues faster than our competitors 
we do anticipate facing increased competition in the future from erp and scm applications vendors and business application software vendors that may broaden their solution offerings by internally developing or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain planning and execution software 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
services revenue our services business consists of professional services consulting and training and customer support services and software enhancements 
in  our services revenue totaled million  or of total revenue  with gross margins of 
professional services accounted for approximately of total services revenue and nearly of total revenue in when comparing our operating margins to other technology companies  our operating margin profile can be lower due to our large services revenue mix as a percentage of total revenue 
while we believe our services margins are very strong  they do lower our overall operating margin as services margins are lower than license revenue margins 

table of contents at december   our consulting services business totaled  employees  about of our total employees worldwide 
our professional services organization provides our customers with expertise and assistance in planning and implementing our solutions 
to ensure a successful product implementation  consultants assist customers with the initial installation of a system  the conversion and transfer of the customer s historical data onto our system  and ongoing training  education and system upgrades 
we believe our professional services enable customers to implement our software rapidly  ensure the customer s success with our solution  strengthen our customer relationships  and add to our industry specific knowledge base for use in future implementations and product innovations 
although our consulting services are optional  the majority of our customers use at least some portion of these services for the implementation and ongoing support of our software solutions 
consulting services are typically rendered under time and materials based contracts with services typically billed on an hourly basis 
professional services are sometimes rendered under fixed fee based contracts with payments due on specific dates or milestones 
typically  our consulting services lag license revenue by several quarters  as implementation services are performed after the purchase of the software 
services revenue growth is contingent upon license revenue growth  which is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  our consulting services business has competitive exposure to offshore providers and other consulting companies 
all of these factors potentially create the risk of pricing pressure  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
for customer support services and software enhancements csse  we offer a comprehensive program that provides our customers with software upgrades that offer additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives 
we offer hour customer support every day of the year plus software upgrades for an annual fee that is paid in advance 
our csse revenues totaled million in  representing approximately of services revenue and approximately of total revenue  respectively 
the growth of csse revenues is influenced by new license revenue growth  annual renewal of support contracts  increase in customers through acquisitions  and fluctuations in currency rates 
substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts 
over the last three years  our annual renewal rate of customers subscribing to comprehensive support and enhancements has been greater than 
csse revenue is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
csse renewal revenue is not recognized unless payment is received from the customer 
hardware and other revenue our hardware and other revenues totaled million in representing of total revenue with gross margins of 
in conjunction with the licensing of our software  and as a convenience for our customers  we resell a variety of hardware products developed and manufactured by third parties 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners  and other peripherals 
we resell all third party hardware products pursuant to agreements with manufacturers or through distributor authorized reseller agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to purchase hardware products at discount prices and to receive technical support in connection with product installations and any subsequent product malfunctions 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  we do not maintain significant hardware inventory 
product development we intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development r d  which historically has averaged about cents of every revenue dollar  to provide market leading solutions that help global manufacturers  wholesalers  distributors  retailers and logistics providers successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating demands as well as the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
at december   our r d organization totaled employees  located in the us and india  representing about of our total employees worldwide 
we will continue to focus our r d resources on the development and enhancement of supply chain software solutions 
we offer what we believe to be the broadest solution portfolio in the supply chain solutions marketplace  to address all aspects of planning and forecasting  inventory optimization  order lifecycle management  transportation lifecycle management and distribution management 
the underpinning of our product portfolio is the services based supply chain process platform  which provides the foundation for ensuring that all our solutions reside on a common architecture  leverage common master and transaction data and 
table of contents utilize the same business services to accomplish tasks common to multiple solutions  enabling our customers to lower their total cost of ownership while optimizing their supply chain effectiveness and efficiency 
we also plan to continue to provide enhancements to existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address evolving industry standards and market needs 
we identify further enhancements to existing solutions and opportunities for new solutions through our customer support organization  as well as through ongoing customer consulting engagements and implementations  interactions with our user groups  association with leading industry analysts and market research firms  and participation on industry standards and research committees 
our solutions address the needs of customers in various vertical markets  including retail  consumer goods  food and grocery  logistics service providers  industrial and wholesale  high technology and electronics  life sciences and government 
cash flow and financial condition for  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million and have generated a cumulative total of million for the three years ended  and our cash and investments at december  totaled million  with no debt on our balance sheet 
we currently have no credit facilities 
during the past three years  our primary uses of our cash have been to continue funding of r d investment and operations to drive earnings growth and to repurchase common stock 
at the end of  we had million in remaining share repurchase authority 
in  we anticipate that our priorities for use of cash will be similar to prior years  with our first priority being continued investment in product development and profitably growing our business to extend our market leadership 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our product footprint and technology direction 
we will also continue to weigh our share repurchase options against cash for acquisitions and investing in the business 
we do not anticipate any borrowing requirements in for general corporate purposes 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we believe that estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between those estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  stock based compensation  and business combinations 
revenue recognition our revenue consists of revenues from the licensing and hosting of software  fees from implementation and training services collectively  professional services  plus customer support services and software enhancements  and sales of hardware and other other consists of reimbursements of out of pocket expenses incurred by professional services 
all revenue is recognized net of any related sales taxes 
we recognize license revenue under statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  specifically when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and all revenue recognition criteria in sop  other than the requirement for vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied 
for those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized using contract accounting 

table of contents the accounting related to license revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules which are subject to change 
our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  we may be unable to determine that collectibility is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
our services revenue consists of fees generated from professional services  customer support services and software enhancements related to our software products 
fees from professional services performed by us are generally billed on an hourly basis  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
professional services are sometimes rendered under agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement 
revenue related to fixed fee based contracts is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the hours incurred on discrete projects within an overall services arrangement 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known 
revenue related to customer support services and software enhancements is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
hardware and other revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties that are integrated with and complementary to our software solutions 
as part of a complete solution  our customers periodically purchase hardware from us in conjunction with the licensing of software 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  radio frequency identification rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer when title passes 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  we do not maintain significant hardware inventory 
in accordance with the financial accounting standard board s fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  we recognize amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue 
such amounts have been included in hardware and other revenue 
the total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to revenue was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credits based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue  which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test  which requires us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value 
the impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believed was impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december   our goodwill balance was million 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events 
table of contents that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  allowable deductions  projected tax credits and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position 
if the recognition threshold is met  we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of options granted on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
we base our estimate of fair value on certain assumptions  including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option  the expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option 
we base our expected volatilities on a combination of the historical volatility of our stock and the implied volatility of publicly traded options issued by third party for our common stock 
due to the limited trading volume of publicly traded options for our common stock  we place a greater emphasis on historical volatility of our common stock 
we also use historical data to estimate the term that options are expected to be outstanding and the forfeiture rate of options granted 
we base the risk free interest rate on the rate for us treasury zero coupon issues with a term approximating the expected term 
we recognize compensation cost for awards with graded vesting using the straight line attribution method  with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
compensation cost recognized in any period is impacted by the number of stock options granted and the vesting period which generally is four years  as well as the underlying assumptions used in estimating the fair value on the date of grant 
this estimate is dependent upon a number of variables such as the number of options awarded  cancelled or exercised and fluctuations in our share price during the year 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts and acquired developed technologies  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with purchase price allocations  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed in connection with acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts  upgrades  or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
the estimated research 
table of contents and development costs are not included in the fair value determination  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
the sum of the costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
accounting charges asset impairment charges 
during  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million  writing down the remaining balance of a million investment in an rfid technology company we made in july we recorded the additional impairment due to a combination of continued negative financial results reported by this company in a very competitive sector and a down round of financing ie  a round of financing that was dilutive to our investment in which our preferred share ownership was converted into common stock  eliminating our preference rights associated with liquidation  thereby substantially impairing our ability to recoup our investment 
in addition  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on an investment in an auction rate security 
we reduced the carrying value to zero due to a combination of credit downgrades of the underlying issuer and the bond insurer as well as increased publicly reported exposure to bankruptcy risk by the issuer and continued significant deterioration in the credit markets limiting the issuer s ability to re finance the underlying bond 
restructuring charge 
during  we committed to and initiated plans to reduce our workforce by approximately positions due to intermediate term market demand and to realign our capacity with demand forecasts 
as a result of this initiative  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million pretax million after tax or per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of the restructuring charge primarily consists of employee severance and outplacement services 
highlights of full year consolidated financial results summarized highlights for our results  as compared to  are total revenue was essentially flat at million compared to million for  o license revenue decreased to million  o services revenue increased to million  operating income was million compared to million in  includes the million of unusual adjustments taken in the second half of described above under accounting charges  diluted earnings per share was  a decrease of  cash flow from operations totaled million  a increase over  cash and investments on hand at december  was million  increasing million over december   and the company repurchased approximately million shares of common stock during the year totaling million at an average price of under its publicly announced buy back program

the restructuring charge of million in mainly represents employee severance and outplacement services resulting from the workforce reduction initiative executed in the fourth quarter of acquisition charges for include employee retention bonuses associated with our evant  inc acquisition in settlement charges for represent legal settlements resulting from disputes over the implementation of our software 
we manage our business based on three geographic regions the americas  emea  and apac 
geographic revenue information is based on the location of sale 
the revenues represented below are from external customers only 
the geographical based costs consist of costs of personnel  direct sales and marketing expenses  and general and administrative costs to support the business 
there are certain corporate expenses included in the americas region that are not charged to the other segments including research and development  certain marketing and general and administrative costs that support the global organization and the amortization of acquired developed technology 
included in the americas costs are all research and development costs  including the costs associated with the company s india operations

this diversification is contributing to the fluctuations in the sales mix of our solutions groups 
services revenue year compared with year services revenue increased or million in over principally due to a or million increase of software enhancements revenue 
the emea and americas segments led the growth with an increase in services revenue of million  or  and million  or  respectively  from to these increases were partially offset by a decrease in apac services revenue of million  or  from to due to the lack of large license sales closed in year compared with year services revenue increased million  or  in over principally due to a increase of professional services revenue required to implement larger projects  increased license sales and existing customer upgrades to more current versions of our offerings and a increase in revenue from software enhancement agreements 
the americas segment led the growth with an increase in services revenue of million  or  from to services revenue in emea also increased by million  or  from to these increases were partially offset by a decrease in apac services revenue of million from to due to the lack of large license sales closed in 
table of contents over the past several years  our services revenue growth and margins have been affected by some pricing pressures 
we believe that the pricing pressures are attributable to deteriorating global macro economic conditions and competition 
in addition  our services revenue growth will be affected by timing of license revenue growth and the mix of products sold 
for instance  individual engagements involving our non warehouse management solutions typically require less implementation services resources 
hardware and other sales of hardware decreased million  or  in compared to sales of hardware increased million  or in over over of this revenue is generated from the americas segment 
sales of hardware are largely dependent upon customer specific desires  which fluctuate 
reimbursements for out of pocket expenses are required to be classified as revenue and are included in hardware and other revenue 
for  and  reimbursements by customers for out of pocket expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively

cost of licenses decreased million  or  in compared with cost of services year compared with year cost of services consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses of employees dedicated to professional and technical services and customer support services 
the increase in cost of services in  from million to million was primarily due to i a million increase in salary related costs resulting from a increase in the average number of personnel dedicated to the delivery of professional services  prior to our fourth quarter workforce reduction  ii an million increase in travel expenses  and iii a million increase in third party software maintenance  partially offset by a decrease of million in bonus and commission expense 
the services gross margin decreased basis points to in the reduction in the services gross margin in was caused by the more intricate services work required as our sales mix shifts from our heritage system i platform to our open systems platform 
we expect to see downward pressure on services revenue growth as a result of lower america s license revenues combined with the slowing in upgrade activity given the global economic climate 
year compared with year the increase in cost of services in  from million to million  was primarily due to i increases in salary related costs resulting from a increase in the average number of personnel dedicated to the delivery of professional services  ii an increase of million in bonus expense based on our cumulative performance relative to internal plans  and was iii partially off set by a decrease of million in stock compensation expense due to completed vesting of options issued prior to combined with a reduction in stock awards granted

the manhattan scope platform provides not only a sophisticated service oriented architecture based application framework  but a platform that facilitates the integration with enterprise resource planning erp and other supply chain solutions 
for the years ended december    and  we capitalized no research and development costs because the costs incurred following the attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date of general release were insignificant 
year compared with year research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and other personnel related costs for personnel involved in our research and development activities

table of contents sales and marketing year compared with year sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions  travel and other personnel related costs of sales and marketing personnel and the costs of our marketing and alliance programs and related activities 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or to million  in compared to the decrease in sales and marketing expense in is principally caused by the decrease of million in bonus and commissions due to the year over year decrease in license revenue  partially offset by a million increase in stock compensation expense

we have recorded goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets as part of the purchase accounting associated with various acquisitions  including the acquisitions of evant in august  eebiznet in july  avere  inc in january  returncentral  inc 
in june  and logistics 
com  inc in december the decreases in amortization expense in and of million and million  respectively  were mainly associated with certain intangible assets related to prior acquisitions which became fully amortized 
impairment charges asset impairment charges of million in consist of a million impairment on an investment in an auction rate security and a million impairment on an investment in an rfid technology company 
we reduced the carrying value of the auction rate security investment to zero due to a combination of credit downgrades of the underlying issuer and the bond insurer as well as increased publicly reported exposure to bankruptcy risk by the issuer and continued significant deterioration in the credit markets limiting the issuer s ability to re finance the underlying bond 
we wrote down the remaining balance of our million investment in the company due to a combination of continued negative financial results reported by this company in 
table of contents a very competitive sector and a down round of financing ie a round of financing that was dilutive to our investment in which our preferred share ownership was converted into common stock  eliminating our preference rights associated with liquidation  thereby substantially impairing our ability to recoup our investment 
in  based on our assessment of uncertainties associated with the fair value of our investment in an rfid technology company following its unsuccessful public offering during the third quarter of  we wrote down million of our million investment 
restructuring and acquisition related charges during  we committed to and initiated plans to reduce our workforce by approximately positions due to intermediate term market demand and to realign our capacity with demand forecasts 
as a result of this initiative  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million pretax million after tax or per fully diluted share in fourth quarter the restructuring charge consisted of employee severance and outplacement services 
the million of charges for represent the remaining expense of million paid for employee retention bonuses incurred in connection with the acquisition of evant  inc in september settlement charges the million pretax million after tax or per fully diluted share in legal settlement costs in relate to two litigation matters  one with a large german customer and one with a domestic customer regarding implementation of warehouse management systems 
in both litigation matters  a settlement was reached in january the recorded charges represent our portion of the settlement agreed to with our insurance carrier  subsequent to december  operating income operating income in decreased by million on a flat consolidated revenue year over year 
operating margins declined from in to in the decline in profit contribution and margin in was largely driven by the following factors i lower license revenues in  which have a relatively higher margin compared to services revenues  ii million of asset write downs  iii a million restructuring charge  iv a million increase in stock option expense  and v a million increase in research and development investment

operating income for apac decreased by million mainly due to lower revenue 
other income and income taxes year ended december  change to to other income  net income tax provision 
table of contents other income  net other income  net primarily includes interest income and foreign currency gains and losses 
interest income was million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and the decrease of million in interest income in compared to was due to overall lower average investment balances driven by our share repurchase programs 
interest income remained consistent from to the weighted average interest rate earned on cash and investment securities was  and for the year ended december   and  respectively 
we recorded net foreign currency gains of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the foreign currency gains mainly resulted from gains on intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies with subsidiaries due to the fluctuation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies  primarily the indian rupee  the british pound and the euro 
income tax provision our effective income tax rates were   and in  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate takes into account the source of taxable income  domestically by state and internationally by country  and available income tax credits 
the reduction in the effective income tax rate in compared to primarily resulted from a release of income tax reserves resulting from expiring tax audit statutes for us federal income tax returns filed for and prior  partially offset by the asset impairment charges for which no tax benefit was recorded 
the lower effective tax rate in compared to was primarily attributable to higher deductible stock option expense and the impact of legal settlements in  partially offset by tax on certain intercompany balances 
liquidity and capital resources during   and  we funded our operations through cash generated from operations 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments as compared to million at december  our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
cash from operating activities for increased by million due to strong accounts receivable collections 
in addition  cash flow from operations in included legal settlement payments of million for legal settlements in the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding dso was days at december  compared to at december  cash from operating activities for decreased million compared to  principally because of an increase in accounts receivable driven by record revenues that increased days sales outstanding to days at december  as compared to days at december  during  our investing activities provided cash of approximately million from net maturities and sales of investments of million  partially offset by payments in connection with purchases of capital equipment of million 
our investing activities provided cash of approximately million during the year ended december   primarily from the net maturities of investments of million which was used mainly to fund stock repurchases  partially offset by payments of million for capital equipment to support our business and infrastructure

these repurchases were partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of board approved share repurchase authority remaining 
periodically  opportunities may arise to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary and synergistic companies  products and technologies 
any material acquisition could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
we believe that existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs at least for the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we anticipate that we will be able to continue fund our operations with cash flow from operations in the future 
we do not maintain any bank lines of credit 
however  if the company should encounter a need to raise additional capital  recent turmoil in the credit and capital markets could make such capital unavailable  or available only at unfavorable costs 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas no 
r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r will change the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items including expensing acquisition related costs as incurred and expensing restructuring costs associated with an acquired business 
sfas no 
r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we expect that sfas no 
r will have an impact on our accounting for future business combinations once adopted but the extent of the impact is dependent upon the number  size  and complexity of acquisitions that we make in the future 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in fasb statements no 
 fair value measurements  and no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for the entity s fiscal year that begins after november  we do not elect to measure at fair value any of our financial instruments under the provisions of sfas no 
 thus the adoption of this statement effective january  did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
which establishes a framework for reporting fair value and expands disclosures required for fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no

s fair value measurements to non financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis 
we partially adopted sfas no 
on january  related to all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
we are currently assessing the potential impact this statement will have on the consolidated financial statements once it is adopted for non financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis 
see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  for further discussion of the adoption 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december  consist of obligations under operating leases 
we expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of sec rules 
lease commitments we lease our facilities and some of our equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through rent expense for these leases aggregated million  million and million during   and  respectively 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  in thousands total thereafter non cancelable operating leases indemnifications our sales agreements with customers generally contain infringement indemnity provisions 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with patent  copyright or trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customer s authorized use of our products and services 
the indemnity provisions generally provide 
table of contents for our control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer  as well as our modification of the product so it is no longer infringing or  if it cannot be corrected  return of the product for a refund 
our sales agreements with customers sometimes also contain indemnity provisions for death  personal injury or property damage caused by our personnel or contractors in the course of performing services to customers 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with death  personal injury and property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors 
the indemnity provisions generally provide for our control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer 
the indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on the amount of award covered 
we have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations 
we account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of december  warranties we warrant to our customers that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer for days after first use of the licensed products  but no more than months after execution of the license agreement 
additionally  we warrant to our customers that our services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards or specific service levels through completion of the agreed upon services 
if necessary  we would provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
however  we have not incurred significant recurring expense under our product or service warranties 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is nominal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign business our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our international operations currently include business activity out of offices in the united kingdom  the netherlands  france  australia  japan  china  singapore and india 
when the us dollar strengthens against a foreign currency  the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to us dollars decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to us dollars increases 
we recognized a foreign exchange rate gain of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
foreign exchange rate transaction gains and losses are classified in other income loss  net in our consolidated statements of income 
a fluctuation of in the period end exchange rates at december  and relative to the us dollar would result in changes of approximately million and million in the reported foreign currency gain or loss  respectively 
interest rates we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including taxable and tax advantaged floating rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national governmental entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are derived from operations 
at december   our cash and investments balance totaled million  of which million is liquid 
the remaining investments totaling million are invested in auction rate securities 
our investments in marketable securities consist principally of debt instruments of state and local government agencies and us corporate commercial paper 
these investments are categorized as available for sale securities and recorded at fair market value  as defined by sfas no 
at december   we hold million of investments in auction rate securities  which have original maturities greater than one year  but which have auctions to reset the yield every to days 
the fair values of these auction rate securities considered the credit worthiness of the counterparty  estimates of interest rates  expected holding periods  and the timing and value of expected future cash flows 
changes in the assumptions of our valuation could have a significant impact on the value of these securities  which may cause losses and affect our liquidity specifically for these securities potentially requiring us to record an impairment charge on these investments in the future 
certain auctions failed during and the underlying securities were not called by the issuer 
during  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on one of these investments resulting in million in total auction rate securities investments on the balance sheet at december  we reduced the carrying value to zero due to credit downgrades of the underlying issuer and the bond insurer as well as 
table of contents increasing publicly reported exposure to bankruptcy risk by the issuer 
the remaining million of auction rate securities held by us at december  were issued by state or regional educational loan authorities and are collateralized by federally insured student loans 
these investments have high credit ratings  and we intend and have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or until called 
however  due to liquidity concerns rather than creditworthiness  we have recorded an unrealized loss of million as of december  for the temporary decline in the fair value of these investments 
the unrealized loss is included as a separate component of stockholders equity and in total comprehensive income 
we will continue to evaluate the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities each reporting period for a potential other than temporary impairment 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate of return on cash and investment securities was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the fair value of cash equivalents and investments held at december  and was million and million  respectively 
based on the average investments outstanding during and  increases or decreases of basis points would result in increases or decreases to interest income of approximately thousand and thousand in and  respectively  from the reported interest income
