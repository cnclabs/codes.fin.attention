our fiscal years end on february management summary educational development corporation is the sole distributor in the united states of the usborne line of children s books

these two divisions each have their own customer base 
the publishing division markets its products on a wholesale basis to various retail accounts 
the ubam division markets its products to individual consumers as well as to school and public libraries through direct selling consultants

company personnel attend many of the national trade shows held by the book selling industry each year  allowing us to make contact with potential buyers who may be unfamiliar with our books 
we actively target the national chains through joint promotional efforts and institutional advertising in trade publications 
the publishing division also participates with certain customers in a cooperative advertising allowance program  under which we pay back up to of the net sales to that customer 
our products are then featured in promotions  such as catalogs  offered by the vendor 
we may also acquire  for a fee  an end cap position in a bookstore our products are placed on the end of a shelf  which in the publishing industry is considered an advantageous location in the bookstore 
the costs of these promotions have been classified as reductions in revenue in the statements of earnings 
the publishing division s in house telesales group targets the smaller independent book and gift store market 
our semi annual  full color  page catalogs  are mailed to over  customers and potential customers 
we also offer two display racks to assist stores in displaying our products

net revenues were down for inside sales  offset by an increase of for national chain stores 
usborne books and more ubam division the ubam division is a multi level selling organization that markets its products through independent sales representatives consultants located throughout the united states 
the customer base of ubam consists of individual purchasers  as well as school and public libraries 
revenues are generated through home shows  direct sales  internet sales  book fairs and contracts with school and public libraries 
an important factor in the continued growth of the ubam division is the addition of new sales consultants and the retention of existing consultants 
current active consultants recruit new sales consultants 
ubam makes it easy to recruit by providing low cost signing kits 
for one month  kits containing sample products and supplies were free to new recruits when a minimum dollar home show was submitted by the new recruit 
ubam provides an extensive handbook that is a valuable tool in explaining the various programs to the new recruit 
consultants during year fy fy new sales representatives active sales representatives end of fiscal year the ubam division presently has six levels of sales representatives consultants supervisors

consultants receive commissions from each sale they make  the commission rate being determined by the marketing program under which the sale is made 
in addition  consultants receive a monthly sales bonus once their sales reach an established monthly goal

percent of net revenues by ubam marketing program fy fy home shows direct sales school library  including book fair internet transportation revenue totals number of orders by ubam marketing program fy fy home shows direct sales school library internet net revenues from home shows declined or  during fiscal year this was a combination of per order averages which were down and a lower number of orders placed during the period 
homes shows were the original marketing program when ubam began in consultants contact individuals hostesses to hold book shows in their homes 
the consultant assists the hostess in setting up the details for the show and makes a presentation at the show and takes orders for the books 
the hostess earns free books based upon the total sales at the show 
customer specials are available for customers when they order a selected amount 
additionally  home shows provide an excellent opportunity for recruiting new consultants 
net revenues from direct sales declined or  during fiscal year this resulted from a decrease in the number of orders placed during the year and a decrease in the per order average 
direct sales are sales without a hostess being involved 
this program makes it possible for consultants to work directly out of their homes by selling to friends  neighbors and other customers 
it is 
table of contents especially convenient for those individuals who wish to order books from a consultant but are unable to attend a home show 
the ubam division offers many promotions customer specials throughout the year 
these promotions offer the customer the opportunity to purchase selected items at a discount if the customer meets the defined criteria 
the discounts under these promotions are recorded in discounts and allowances 
the school and library marketing program  including book fairs  increased or  during fiscal year the number of orders placed during the year were up while the per order average decreased 
our book fair program is comparable to scholastic s program  which continues to dominate the book fair market 
many schools hold joint book fairs with ubam and our competitors  but in many cases  ubam book fairs have been the only participant 
school and library sales are restricted to consultants who have received additional  specialized training which allows them to sell to schools and libraries 
the ubam consultant is the only source that a library or school has for library bound usborne books 
they are not available through any of the school supply distribution companies 
book fairs can be held with almost any organization as the sponsor 
the consultant provides promotional materials to acquaint parents with the books 
parents turn in their orders at a designated time 
the book fair program generates free books for the sponsoring organization 
ubam also has a reach for the stars fundraiser program 
this is a pledge based reading incentive program that provides cash and books to the organization and books for the children 
internet sales continue to show growth for ubam  increasing or  during fiscal year consultants utilize in house developed and hosted web sites in their businesses for a nominal monthly fee 
they can customize the web sites to their own particular needs or they can maintain the generic site 
orders are transmitted to us through a shopping cart arrangement and the consultant receives sales credit and commission on the sales 
web only specials are changed frequently and have proved successful  contributing to the growth in this market 
the cost of free books provided under the various ubam marketing programs is recorded as operating and selling expense in the statements of earnings 
we believe that the ubam division has the greatest growth potential for us 
while there are many multi level companies in the united states  ubam is the only one exclusively selling books 
we believe this is a fertile market with excellent opportunities for continued growth 
the keys to future growth in the ubam division are recruiting and retaining consultants 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources edc has a history of profitability and positive cash flow 
we can continue to grow with minimal additional capital requirements 
our primary source of cash is generated from operations 
our primary uses of cash are to pay dividends  acquire treasury stock  purchase property and equipment  and repay borrowings on our line of credit 
we utilize our bank credit facility to meet our short term cash requirements  when needed 
we expect our ongoing cash flow to continue to exceed cash required to operate the business 
consequently  we expect short term borrowings to remain at a minimum during the current fiscal year 
during fiscal year we experienced a positive cash flow from operations of  cash flow from operations was increased by a decrease in inventories of  and an increase in current liabilities of  offset by a decrease in other assets of cash used in investing activities was  primarily due to  related to the kane miller book publishers acquisition as well as  for capital expenditures 
we estimate that cash used in investing activities for fiscal year will be less than  this would consist of software and hardware enhancements to our existing data processing equipment  property improvements and additional warehouse equipment 
cash used in financing activities was  which was primarily due to dividend payments of  and  paid to acquire treasury stock 
these were offset by cash received from financing activities of  from the exercise of stock options and  from the sale of treasury stock 
in september  the board of directors authorized paying a minimum annual cash dividend of of net earnings 
in fiscal years and we paid and  respectively  of net earnings as a cash dividend 
our board of directors adopted a stock repurchase plan in which we may purchase up to an additional  shares as market conditions warrant 
management believes the stock is undervalued and when stock becomes available at an attractive price  we can utilize free cash flow to repurchase shares 
management believes this enhances the value to the remaining stockholders and that these repurchases will have no adverse effect on our short term and long term liquidity

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our valuation of inventory  allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable  allowance for sales returns  long lived assets and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  however  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  we consider the following accounting policies to be more significantly dependent on the use of estimates and assumptions 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation whereby share based payment transactions with employees  such as stock options and restricted stock  are measured at estimated fair value at date of grant and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
revenue recognition sales are recognized and recorded when products are shipped 
products are shipped fob shipping point 
the ubam division s sales are paid before the product is shipped 
these sales accounted for of net revenues in fiscal year and of net revenues in fiscal year the provisions of the sec staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements  have been applied  and as a result  a reserve is provided for estimated future sales returns 
estimated allowances for sales returns are recorded as sales are recognized and recorded 
management uses a moving average calculation to estimate the allowance for sales returns 
we are not responsible for product damaged in transit 
damaged returns are primarily from the retail stores 
the damages occur in the stores  not in shipping to the stores 
it is industry practice to accept returns from wholesale customers 
transportation revenue  the amount billed to the customer for shipping the product  is recorded when products are shipped 
management has estimated and included a reserve for sales returns of  as of february  and february  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  customers financial conditions and current economic trends 
management has estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of february  and  as of february  inventory management continually estimates and calculates the amount of non current inventory 
the inventory arises due to occasional purchases of book inventory in quantities in excess of what will be sold within the normal operating cycle due to minimum order requirements of our primary supplier 
noncurrent inventory was estimated by management using the current year turnover ratio by title 
all inventory in excess of years of anticipated sales was classified as noncurrent inventory 
noncurrent inventory balances were  and  at february  and february   respectively 
inventories are presented net of a valuation allowance 
management has estimated and included a valuation allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory 
this allowance is based on management s identification of slow moving inventory on hand 
management has estimated a valuation allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory of  and  as of february  and february   respectively 
our product line contains approximately  titles  each with different rates of sale  depending upon the nature and popularity of the title 
almost all of our product line is saleable as the books are not topical in nature and remain current in content today as well as in the future 
our products are printed in europe  china  singapore  india  malaysia and dubai resulting in a four to six month lead time to have a title reprinted and delivered to us 
our principal supplier  based in england  imposes minimum order requirements before reprinting a title 
at the current time we must reorder  or more of a title in order to get a solo print run 
if we order less than  of a title  then we must share a print run with the supplier s other customers 
sharing 
table of contents a print run has resulted in delays of up to twelve months in receiving the ordered title 
anticipating customer preferences and purchasing habits requires historical analysis of similar titles in the same series 
we then place the initial order or re order based upon this analysis 
these factors and historical analysis have led management to determine that years represents a reasonable estimate of the normal operating cycle for our products
