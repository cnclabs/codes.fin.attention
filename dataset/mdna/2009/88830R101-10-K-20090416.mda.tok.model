item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing under item some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and expected financial results  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors under item a for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business description we own and operate what we believe is one of the largest networks of full service agricultural and construction equipment stores in north america 
based upon information provided to us by cnh global nv or its nv subsidiary cnh america llc  collectively referred to in this annual report as cnh  we are the world s largest retail dealer of case ih agriculture equipment and a major retail dealer of new holland agriculture  case construction and new holland construction equipment in the us the agricultural equipment we sell and service includes machinery and attachments for uses ranging from large scale farming to home and garden use 
the construction equipment we sell and service includes heavy construction and light industrial machinery for commercial and residential construction  road and highway construction and mining applications 
we offer our customers a one stop solution for their equipment needs through new and used equipment sales  parts sales  repair and maintenance services  and equipment rental and other activities 
the new equipment and parts we sell are supplied primarily by cnh 
according to public reports filed by cnh  cnh is a leading manufacturer and supplier of agricultural and construction equipment based on the number of units sold  primarily through the case ih agriculture  new holland agriculture  case construction and new holland construction brands 
sales of new cnh products accounted for approximately of our new equipment revenue in fiscal  with no other supplier accounting for more than 
we acquire used equipment for resale through trade ins from our customers and selective purchases 
we sell parts and provide in store and on site repair and maintenance services 
we rent equipment and provide other ancillary services such as equipment transportation  gps signal subscriptions and finance and insurance products 
throughout our year operating history we have built an extensive  geographically contiguous network of stores  including two outlet stores  located in north dakota  south dakota  minnesota  iowa  nebraska  montana and wyoming 
we have a successful history of growth through acquisitions  including acquisitions consisting of stores operating in seven states since january  we have a well established track record of successfully integrating acquired stores  retaining acquired store employees and maintaining acquired store customer relationships 
we expect that acquisitions will continue to be an important component of our growth 

table of contents certain external factors affecting our business we are subject to a number of factors that affect our business as discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements 
certain of the external factors include  but are not limited to  the following industry factors our business is primarily driven by the demand for agricultural equipment for use in the production of food  fiber  feed grain and renewable energy  home and garden applications  and the maintenance of commercial  residential and government properties 
based on usda data  we believe farmers have recently experienced historically strong economic fundamentals  driven by growing global demand for agricultural commodities in part due to growth in renewable energy and the economies of developing countries 
this strong farm economy contributed significantly to our results of operations in fiscal and we believe our operating model  as discussed in business titan operating model  enables us to maximize opportunities and implement our conservative expenditure philosophy that emphasizes scalable costs 
further  our large and diverse customer base and seven state geographic footprint limits our exposure to negative events that may occur in a particular area or crop 
additionally  we believe that the acquisition opportunities will continue to be strong 
additionally  our business is impacted by the demand for construction equipment for use in private and government commercial  residential and infrastructure construction  demolition  maintenance  mining and forestry operations 
cnh and industry reports show that demand for construction equipment in our markets is driven by several factors  one of which is public infrastructure spending  including roads and highways  sewer and water 
on february   congress enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra  a bill intended to stimulate economic growth and create jobs in part through additional government spending on public infrastructure 
any growth in federal allocations to public infrastructure spending over the next few years should positively impact our future results of operations  though it is difficult to assess the short term impacts of the arra  which could impact our customers and the industries in which we operate in unforeseen ways 
an offsetting factor may be the recent declines in residential and commercial real estate development to the extent such declines continue and the tightening of the credit markets that finance these real estate and infrastructure developments 
to address the uncertainty of the construction industry  we expect to continue our focus on agricultural industries and acquisition opportunities to establish additional locations in the markets where we believe the local construction industry will maintain its current level or grow 
seasonality our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation due to varying weather patterns  which may impact the timing and amount of equipment  parts and service purchases by our customers 
a significant increase in the severity of weather cycles could increase the volatility of our results of operations and impact our financial condition 
if we acquire businesses in geographic areas other than where we currently have operations  we may be affected more by the above mentioned or other seasonal and equipment buying trends 
economic cyclicality sales of equipment  particularly new units  historically have fluctuated with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  equipment retailers tend to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy 
the impact of an economic downturn on retailers is generally less than the impact on manufacturers due to the sale of parts and service by retailers to maintain customer equipment 
as noted above  the agricultural industries recently experienced an historically 
table of contents positive economic cycle from which we benefited  but we expect the cycle to return to more typical levels in fiscal credit market changes changes in credit markets can affect our customers ability and willingness to make capital expenditures  including purchasing our equipment 
creditors have recently tightened their lending standards due to the collapse of the sub prime mortgage market 
these tightened lending standards may have a negative impact on our business if our customers are unable to obtain financing for equipment purchases 
however  if interest rates continue to decrease  our business may be positively affected by customers who find financing purchases of our equipment more attractive due to lower borrowing costs 
our business is also particularly dependent on our access to credit markets to finance acquisitions and manage inventory 
tightened lending standards may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms 
we cannot predict what future changes will occur in credit markets or how these changes will impact our business 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results and we do not expect it to have such an impact in the future 
to date  in those instances in which we have experienced cost increases  we have been able to increase selling prices to offset such increases 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation or that we can continue to increase our selling prices to offset increased costs and remain competitive 
acquisitions we have a successful history of growth through acquisitions 
since january   we have completed acquisitions consisting of stores operating in seven states 
these acquisitions have been the most significant factor affecting our results of operations and liquidity over the last several years  as noted in the period to period comparisons below 
we expect that acquisitions will continue to be an important component of our growth 
acquisitions are typically financed with floorplan debt  long term debt and cash from operations 
although we cannot quantify the impact of any such potential acquisitions  we believe the nature of their impact on our financial statements to be similar to that experienced with our prior acquisitions as noted in our discussions of period comparisons 
the following is a summary of acquisitions completed during the identified periods

we subsequently merged farm power into our company 
critical accounting policies and estimates during the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect reported amounts 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments include those related to bad debts and credit sales  inventories  goodwill and intangibles  income taxes and legal proceedings  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  incentive plan accruals  deferred taxes  stock based compensation  and accounting for business combinations 
we update these estimates  assumptions and judgments as appropriate  which in most 
table of contents cases is at least quarterly 
we use our technical accounting knowledge  cumulative business experience  judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies 
while we believe our estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in preparing our financial statements are appropriate  they are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome and therefore  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our primary critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition revenue on equipment and parts sales is recognized upon delivery of product to customers 
rental and service revenue is recognized at the time the related services are provided 
in addition to outright sales of new and used equipment  certain rental agreements may include rent to purchase options 
under these agreements  customers are given a period of time to exercise an option to purchase the related equipment  with a portion of the rental payments being applied to the purchase price 
this equipment is included in inventory until the purchase option is exercised 
rental revenue is recognized during the rental period  with equipment sales revenue being recognized upon the exercise of the purchase option 
inventories new and used machinery are stated at the lower of cost specific identification method or market with adjustments for decreases in market value on inventory rented but available for sale being a percentage of the rental income received on such inventory 
equipment held specifically for lease is reported as inventory held for rental 
parts inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  and an estimate of parts inventory not expected to be sold in the next operating cycle has been reported separately 
typically  there are no freight in charges  except in cases of special orders where such freight in charges are included in the cost of inventory 
work in process is valued at the billable rates of labor incurred and parts inventories used on service work in process at year end 
intangible assets and goodwill goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually  or more frequently upon the occurrence of events or circumstances that may affect its fair value 
as of january   the carrying value of goodwill was not considered impaired 
intangible assets include covenants not to compete that are being amortized using the straight line method over the lives of the related agreements  which range from five to ten years 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of receivables  inventory  property and equipment  intangible assets  stock based compensation  and accrued expenses for financial and income tax reporting 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters within our provision for income taxes 
we perform a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with the requirements and recognition standards established by financial interpretations no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
issued fin 
pursuant to fin  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents stock based compensation we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revised  share based payments 
this standard requires that stock based compensation  which includes stock options and restricted stock  be accounted for at the fair value of the applicable equity instrument 
business combinations we account for business combinations in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
this accounting standard allows the acquirer up to one year to finalize the purchase price allocation 
during this one year period our accounting for the business combination transaction may be based on estimates due to various unknown factors present at the date of acquisition 
key financial metrics in addition to tracking our sales and expenses to evaluate our operational performance  we also monitor certain key financial metrics  including absorption and same store sales 
absorption absorption is an industry term that refers to the percentage of an equipment dealer s fixed operating expense covered by the gross margin of its combined parts and service businesses 
absorption in a given period is calculated by dividing our gross profit from parts and service sales in the period by the difference between i our operating expenses including interest on floorplan notes and ii our variable expense of sales commissions on equipment sales and incentive compensation in the same period 
we believe that absorption is an important management metric because during economic down cycles our customers tend to postpone new and used equipment purchases while continuing to run  maintain and repair their existing equipment 
thus  operating at a high absorption rate enables us to operate profitably throughout economic down cycles 
we measure and track absorption on a company wide basis as well as on a per store basis 
for fiscal  our company wide absorption rate was  for fiscal  our company wide absorption rate was  and for fiscal  our company wide absorption rate was 
same store sales same store sales for any period represent sales by stores that were part of our company for the entire comparable period in the preceding fiscal year 
we do not distinguish relocated or newly expanded stores in this same store analysis 
closed stores are excluded from the same store analysis 
we believe that tracking this metric is important to evaluating the success of the titan operating model on a comparable basis 
key financial statement components revenue equipment 
we derive equipment revenue from the sale of new and used agricultural and construction equipment 
parts 
we derive parts revenue from the sale of parts for equipment that we sell  as well as for other equipment makes 
our parts sales provide us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is less sensitive to the economic cycles that affect our equipment sales 

table of contents services 
we derive services revenue from maintenance and repair services to our customers equipment 
our repair and maintenance services provide a high margin  relatively stable source of revenue through changing economic cycles 
other 
we derive other revenue from equipment rentals and ancillary equipment support activities such as equipment transportation  gps signal subscriptions and reselling finance and insurance products 
cost of revenue equipment 
cost of equipment revenue is the lower of the acquired cost or the market value of the specific piece of equipment sold 
parts 
cost of parts revenue is the lower of the acquired cost or the market value of the parts sold  based on average costing 
service 
cost of service revenue represents costs attributable to services provided for the maintenance and repair of customer owned equipment and equipment then on rent by customers 
other 
costs of other revenue represent costs associated with equipment rental  providing transportation  hauling  parts freight  gps subscriptions and damage waivers  including  among other items  drivers wages  fuel costs  shipping costs and our costs related to damage waiver policies 
operating expenses our operating expenses include sales and marketing expenses  sales commissions which generally are based upon equipment gross profit margins  payroll and related benefit costs  insurance expenses  professional fees  property and other taxes  administrative overhead  and depreciation associated with property and equipment other than rental equipment 
floorplan interest the cost of financing inventory is an important factor affecting our results of operations 
floorplan financing from cnh capital represents the primary source of financing for equipment inventories  particularly for equipment supplied by cnh 
cnh regularly offers interest free periods as well as additional incentives and special offers 
as of january   approximately of our floorplan notes payable was non interest bearing 
other interest expense interest expense represents the interest on our outstanding debt instruments  other than floorplan financing facilities

table of contents fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  revenue fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands total revenue equipment parts service other  including trucking and rental the increase in revenue was primarily due to acquisitions contributing to fiscal revenue and same store sales growth 
the acquired stores contributed million in additional total revenue  or of the increase  while the same store sales growth contributed million  or of the increase 
same store sales increased over the prior year  which is indicative of the strong market for the products we sell 
the calculation of same store sales includes fiscal sales of million from a special manufacturer leasing program 
we did not conduct the same program in fiscal but do enter into various other manufacturer programs from time to time 
we believe that fiscal results significantly benefited from a particularly strong agricultural market and believe that the same store growth rates achieved in fiscal are not indicative of future same store sale growth rates 
cost of revenue fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands total cost of revenue equipment parts service other  including trucking and rental the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to increased revenue

the calculation of same store sales includes fiscal gross profit of million from a special manufacturer leasing program 
gross profit margins were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the strong market for our products in fiscal year  particularly equipment  has resulted in improved margins compared to the prior year 
we recorded a similar manufacturer market share incentive bonus in the fourth quarters of fiscal and by achieving annual market share targets established by cnh for product lines within the regions in which we market our products 
these incentives enhanced fourth quarter gross profits for both years 
operating expenses fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands operating expenses the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the additional costs associated with acquisitions such as compensation  rent  depreciation  travel and training 
other costs contributing to higher operating expenses were increased sales commission expenses resulting from increased gross profits  stock option expense and additional costs associated with being a public company  such as increased legal and accounting costs related to regulatory compliance  particularly sarbanes oxley compliance 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal other income expense fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase decrease percent change dollars in thousands interest and other income floorplan interest expense interest expense debt retirement costs interest and other income increased million due to the higher level of cash  cash equivalents and us treasury bills in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in floorplan interest expense of million was due to lower borrowing rates in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense of million was primarily due to lower debt levels for the first eleven months of fiscal  resulting from the retirement of all subordinated debentures as well as the early extinguishment of a portion of our long term debt 
in conjunction with our december initial public offering  we exchanged or converted all million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures for  shares of our common stock and retired million in subordinated debentures 
as a result of these transactions  we recognized debt retirement costs of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal there were no such transactions in fiscal provision for income taxes fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands provision for income taxes 
table of contents the effective tax rate as a percentage of income before taxes decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease resulted from an unrecognized tax benefit of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we did not record any such uncertain tax positions in fiscal if we recognize this tax benefit in the future  our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  revenue fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands total revenue equipment parts service other  including trucking and rental the increase in revenue was primarily due to the following three items acquisitions  same store sales growth and a special manufacturer leasing program 
the acquired stores contributed million in additional total revenue  or of the increase  while the leasing program transactions totaled million  or 
manufacturer leasing programs are offered from time to time but the frequency and terms of these programs cannot be predicted 
the remaining increase of million is attributable to same store sales growth of  which is reflective of the strong market for the products we sell  particularly in the area of equipment sales 
we believe equipment sales were strong in fiscal due to the growth in global demand for agricultural commodities and the positive impact this commodity demand had on farm income 
cost of revenue fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands total cost of revenue equipment parts service other  including trucking and rental the increase in cost of revenue of million was due to revenue increases attributable primarily to acquisitions  same store sales growth and the special leasing program noted above 
acquisitions contributed million to the cost of revenue  while the leasing program added another million  which is and  respectively  of the total increase in cost of revenue from the prior fiscal year 
the remainder of the increase in cost of revenue is reflective of the increase in same store sales 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue was in fiscal  matching the prior fiscal year s results

same store gross profits provided the remainder of the gross profit improvement  primarily due to the increase in same store sales 
total gross profit margins remained even at for both fiscal and normally  a higher percentage of equipment sales would cause total gross margins to decline  but equipment margins were high in fiscal relative to historical levels reflecting a significant increase in demand and partially enhanced by a manufacturer market share incentive bonus program 
we recorded this incentive bonus in the fourth quarter of fiscal by achieving annual market share targets established by cnh for product lines within the regions in which we market the products we sell 
operating expenses fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands operating expenses the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the additional costs associated with acquisitions 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by the strong sales in fiscal resulting in improved fixed operating expense utilization as a percentage of sales 
other income expense fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands interest and other income floorplan interest expense interest expense debt retirement costs   n a floorplan interest expense increased million due to higher levels of floorplan debt in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher floorplan debt is driven by increased equipment inventory levels resulting from acquisitions 
the  increase in interest expense was due to additional long term debt incurred primarily in connection with acquisitions 
in conjunction with our december initial public offering  we exchanged or converted all million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures for  shares of our common stock and retired million in subordinated debentures 
as a result of these transactions  we recognized debt retirement costs of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal

we currently have a credit facility with bremer bank that provides for a million operating line of credit and carries a variable interest rate of prime minus 
the operating line of credit requires monthly payments of interest due and has a maturity date of august  as of january   we had no amount outstanding on the bremer bank operating line of credit 
during fiscal  bremer bank issued us a standby letter of credit in the amount of  to our insurance carrier for deductible retention 
this reduced the amount of borrowings available on our line of credit by  the standby letter of credit expires on august  the bremer bank credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants that require prior consent of bremer bank if we desire to make any loans or advances to any person 
in addition  the bremer bank credit facility restricts our ability to incur indebtedness or liens  places restrictions on our ability to merge or consolidate with any person  make distributions to stockholders  or sell  lease  assign  transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our assets other than in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  the consent of bremer bank is required for the acquisition of any dealership 
cnh capital credit facility 
we currently have a credit facility with cnh capital that provides for an aggregate principal balance of up to million for floorplan financing  the availability of which is reduced by outstanding balances on term loans for rental fleet financing and other acquisition related financing arrangements with cnh  as described below 
the interest rate under the cnh capital floorplan line of credit is equal to the prime rate plus per annum for most purposes  subject to any interest free periods offered by cnh 
the cnh capital term loans and loans for certain purposes have an interest rate equal to the prime rate plus per annum 
cumulative and unpaid balance of advances under the cnh capital credit facility accrues interest each month and requires monthly payments 
the cnh capital credit facility automatically renews on august of each year through august   unless earlier terminated by either party 
the cnh capital credit facility is secured by the related assets 
as of january   we had approximately million outstanding on the cnh capital credit facility 
the cnh capital credit facility contains various restrictive covenants that require prior consent of cnh capital if we desire to engage in any acquisition of  consolidation or merger with any other business entity in which we are not the surviving company  move any collateral outside of the us  or sell  rent  lease or otherwise dispose or transfer any of the 
table of contents collateral  other than in the ordinary course of business 
cnh s consent is also required for the acquisition of any cnh dealership 
in addition  the cnh capital credit facility restricts our ability to incur any liens upon any substantial part of our assets 
other indebtedness with cnh capital 
cnh capital periodically provides loans for fixed asset financing in connection with acquisitions 
related to this acquisition financing  we have various term loans with cnh capital 
the aggregate principal amount of these terms loans was approximately million at january  we also obtained various fixed rate notes with rates primarily ranging from to and variable rate notes at prime plus from cnh capital  which are secured by our designated rental fleet 
the amount of our rental fleet notes as of january   was million 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash reserves  cash flow from operations  proceeds from our public stock offerings  proceeds from the issuance of debt and our borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect that ongoing requirements for debt service and capital expenditures will be funded from these sources 
adequacy of capital resources our primary uses of cash have been to fund our strategic acquisitions  finance the purchase of inventory  purchase us treasury bills  meet debt service requirements and fund operating activities  working capital  payments due under building space operating leases and manufacturer floorplans payable 
the primary factors affecting our ability to generate cash and to meet existing  known or reasonably likely cash requirements are the timing and extent of acquisitions and our operating performance as impacted by i industry factors  ii competition  iii general economic conditions and iv other business factors as identified in item a risk factors 
for fiscal and  we spent million and million on property and equipment  respectively  exclusive of acquisitions and transfers of equipment inventory to our designated rental fleet 
our property and equipment purchases in fiscal were higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in the number of stores and a licensing agreement for a new enterprise resource planning erp software system 
we expect our property and equipment expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions  for fiscal to be approximately to million 
the actual amount of our fiscal equipment expenditures will depend upon factors such as general economic conditions  growth prospects for our industry and our acquisition activity 
we currently expect to finance equipment purchases with borrowings under the existing credit facilities  with available cash or with cash flow from operations 
we may need to incur additional debt if we pursue any future acquisitions 
our ability to service our debt will depend upon our ability to generate the necessary cash 
this will depend on our future acquisitions activity  operating performance  general economic conditions  and financial  competitive  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our immediate control 
based on our current operational performance  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under the existing credit facilities will adequately provide our liquidity needs for  at a minimum  the next months 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the bremer bank and cnh capital credit facilities in amounts sufficient to allow us to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain sufficient future borrowings  we may be required to seek one or more alternatives such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness  selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value of financial instruments but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
we have both fixed and floating rate financing 
some of our floating rate credit facilities contain minimum rates of interest to be charged 
based upon balances and interest rates as of january   holding other variables constant  a one percentage point increase in interest rates for the next month period would decrease pre tax earnings and cash flow by approximately  conversely  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates for the next month period would result in an increase to pre tax earnings and cash flow of approximately  at january   we had variable rate floorplan notes payable of million  of which approximately million was interest bearing  variable notes payable and long term debt of million  and fixed rate notes payable and long term debt of million
