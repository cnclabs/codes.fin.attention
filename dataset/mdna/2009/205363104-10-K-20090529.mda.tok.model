item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company

overview the company s primary service offerings are it and business process outsourcing  and it and professional services 
outsourcing activities include operating all or a portion of a customer s technology infrastructure and applications  and business process outsourcing 
it and professional services include systems integration  consulting and other professional services and software systems sales and related services 
under the company s comprehensive growth strategy introduced in fiscal  known as project accelerate  the company targets the delivery of its services within three broad service lines business solutions and services bs s  global outsourcing services gos and north american public sector nps 
nps and gos are each separate reportable segments  while bs s consists of three reportable segments 
the five segments are as follows north american public sector 
the north american public sector segment operates principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements  including federal acquisition regulations  cost accounting standards and audits by various us federal agencies 
the north american public sector operating segment represents a separate reportable segment 
global outsourcing services 
the global outsourcing services segment provides large scale outsourcing solutions offerings as well as midsize services delivery to customers globally 
the global outsourcing services operating segment represents a separate reportable segment 
business solutions and services consulting 
in the bs s consulting segment  the company provides industry specific consulting and systems integration services  business process outsourcing  and intellectual property ip based software solutions 
these service offerings and clientele overlap and the company draws on multiple operating segments within bs s consulting to serve clients 
these operating segments have similar economic characteristics  products  services  customers and methods of operations and  as a result  are aggregated for segment reporting purposes 
business solutions and services financial services sector 
the bs s financial services sector segment primarily provides ip based software solutions and business process outsourcing services to financial services companies in domestic and international markets 
business solutions and services other 
the company s remaining operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure and do not meet the aggregation criteria as indicated in sfas no 
as a result  these operating segments are reported as other as indicated by sfas no 
because each of these other operating segments are within the company s bs s service line  the company has labeled this group of operating segments as bs s other 
the operating segments comprising bs s other include the company s non gos operations in australia and asia and the company s india operations 
lines of business reportable segments business solutions and services bs s consulting bs s financial services sector bs s other global outsourcing services global outsourcing services north american public sector north american public sector see note to the consolidated financial statements 
economic and industry factors the company s results of operations are affected by economic conditions generally  including macroeconomic conditions 
we are monitoring current macroeconomic and credit market conditions and levels of business confidence and their potential effect on our clients and on us 
a severe and or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies in which we operate 
this may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations 
particularly in light of recent economic uncertainty  we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations 
our results of operations are also affected by levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve  as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 
the ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance 
revenues are driven by our ability to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients 
our ability to add value to clients and therefore drive revenues depends in part on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 
the bs s segments and the gos segment markets are affected by various economic and industry factors 
the economic environment in the regions csc serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on it projects 
csc is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors  including service offerings and flexibility 
management monitors industry factors including relative market shares  growth rates  billing rates  staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates  inflation rates and foreign currency rates 
outsourcing contracts are typically long term relationships 
long term  complex outsourcing contracts  including their consulting components  require ongoing review of the terms and scope of work  in order to meet clients evolving business needs and our performance expectations 
the north american public sector segment market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics 
all us government contracts and subcontracts may be modified  curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change 
in the event that a contract is terminated for convenience  the company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed 
shifting priorities of the us government can also impact the future of projects 
management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts  legislative activity  budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations 
business drivers revenue in all three lines of business is generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to years or more 
factors affecting revenue include the company s ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards  the ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes  the ability to compete on services offered  technical ability  experience and flexibility  the ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues  and currency fluctuations related to international operations 
earnings are driven by the above revenue factors  in addition to the following the ability to control costs  particularly labor costs  subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare  pension and general and administrative costs  the ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses  the ability to accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals  and the ability to develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore 
cash flows are impacted by the above earnings factors  in addition to other factors including the following timely management of receivables and payables  investment opportunities available  particularly related to business acquisitions and dispositions and large outsourcing contracts  and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means  with the primary financial measures including new contract wins  revenue growth  margins  cash flow and return on investment 
new contract wins in addition to being a primary driver of future revenue  focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the company s ability to compete 
the total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or re competed contracts  as well as numerous external factors 
csc employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts 
revenue growth year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins  and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts 
with a wide array of services offered  the company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers 
in addition  incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs  particularly overhead and other indirect costs  thus potentially improving profit margins 
foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth 
margins margins reflect the company s performance on contracts and ability to control costs 
while the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability 
although the majority of the company s costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues  increased use of offshore support also exposes csc to additional margin fluctuations 
cash flow over time the primary drivers of the company s cash flow are earnings provided by the company s operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings 
also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances 
the company also regularly reviews the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap cash flow measurements of operating  investing and financing cash flows  as well as the non gaap measure free cash flow 
return on investment roi roi is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization 
a combination of strong margins measuring how efficiently profit is generated from revenue and investment base turnover measuring how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital is required to generate sufficient returns on capital 
strong working capital management also serves to minimize investment capital and increase returns 
readers should be cautioned that days sales outstanding dso  free cash flow and roi are non gaap measures  and the company s definition of such measures may differ from other companies 
therefore  such measures may not be comparable to those of other companies 
csc believes these non gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the company s financial condition and results of operations as they provide another measure of the company s performance and ability to service its debt 
csc calculates dso as follows total accounts receivable at fiscal period end divided by revenue per day 
total accounts receivables excludes tax receivables 
revenue per day is calculated based on fiscal days in the most recent quarter 
free cash flow is equal to the sum of operating cash flows  investing cash flows  excluding business acquisitions and dispositions  purchase or sale of available for sale securities  and capital lease payments 
roi is calculated by multiplying profit before interest expense  special items  and after tax expense by the investment base turnover 
investment base turnover equals revenues divided by average debt and equity for the period 
the company s management uses roi  dso and free cash flow to evaluate investment returns and cash flow performance and are some of the measures used to assess management performance 
fiscal highlights in fiscal s difficult economic environment  the company delivered improved revenue  pre tax profit  net income  earnings per share and cash flow from operations 
margins improved due to continued focus on productivity and cost management 
during fiscal  the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock  also contributing to improved earnings per share due to the consequent share base reduction for fiscal  despite associated financing costs 
significant events during fiscal include revenues improved million or  while increasing on a constant currency basis 
net income increased to billion  reflecting significant tax benefits from resolutions and adjustments in the us federal and state  as well as international tax jurisdictions 
earnings per share were up on a diluted basis 
the company announced contract awards of billion including new nps segment awards of billion  bs s segments awards of billion  and gos segment awards of billion 
free cash flow of  million increased million from fiscal  driven by improved operating cash flows and lower capital expenditures 
dso was days at april   versus days at march  debt to total capitalization ratio was at year end  an increase of from in fiscal ratio 
roi was for the year  up from in fiscal  driven significantly by fiscal tax benefits 
the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure fiscal year ended in millions april  march  march  free cash flow net cash used in investing activities proceeds from redemption of investment in preferred stock acquisitions  net of cash acquired business dispositions capital lease payments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities the company s significant wins and scope extensions during fiscal included the following global outsourcing services bombardier million  zurich omni million  tdc applications million  exelon million 
north american public sector us air and missile contracts million  us army billion  us navy and navsea million  state of north carolina million  emed new york million  and department of health services dhs million 
the company changed its methodology for determining the announced value for certain awards 
nps announced values for id iq awards represent the expected contract value at the time a task order is awarded under the contract 
the bookings value of gos announced awards are estimated at the time of contract signing based on then existing projections of service volumes and currency exchange rates and include optional contract years 
the announced values for bs s line of business awards are based on firm commitments 
the company has developed a broad  long term revenue base which includes customers spread across multiple industries and geographic regions as well as service lines 
a significant amount of csc s revenues is derived from long term contracts including information technology outsourcing  build and maintain engagements and us federal government engagements 
this provides the company with a base of revenue during periods when contract awards may slow or the market for certain services softens 
cash and cash equivalents at april   was nearly billion  up from approximately million in fiscal  a billion increase compared to a million decrease from fiscal to the fiscal increase reflected increased cash flows from operating activities and lower uses of cash in investing activities 
the higher operating cash flow was primarily attributable to higher net income  with significant non cash tax benefits to net income offset by other improvements in working capital 
the lower investing cash flows were primarily due to fiscal expenditures for acquisitions of million  versus billion for fiscal cash provided from financing activities during fiscal reflect the company s draw down of a credit facility  offset by principal payments on the long term debt and commercial paper 
free cash flow for fiscal was billion  compared to million for fiscal the comparison reflects the fiscal improvement in operating cash flows as well as lower capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
the fiscal results also include significant restructuring outflows and the adverse impact of several timing matters with fiscal  primarily fiscal capital expenditures paid for in fiscal and a large prepayment received at the end of fiscal fiscal commentary although management believes csc s broad service portfolio positions it well to assist public and private sector clients in the ongoing challenging macroeconomic environment  the company expects continued overall pressure on revenue growth during fiscal management will continue to focus on cost control and cash flow 
as a leading federal contractor and one of the top it service providers to the us federal government  csc s nps segment is well positioned to benefit from the demand for it services in this market 
csc sees opportunities for significant growth in the areas of health information and services  and cyber security  both of which are priority areas for funding 
csc anticipates continued strong funding levels in the department of defense  especially in the logistical support and training segments of the budget  and in the department of homeland security for infrastructure modernization 
overall  nps revenue is expected to grow at or above the fiscal level  benefiting from the billion in bookings in fiscal while the ultimate distribution of us federal funds and project assignments can vary  the company expects broad it and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the us federal government 
the company expects the global commercial market to remain challenging during fiscal  due to the current global economic environment 
csc has a base of significant outsourcing contracts  which the company expects will continue to provide a stable revenue stream during fiscal in its gos segment 
however  growth from this revenue stream is expected to be tempered by the continued demand for offshore services and the resulting pressure on prices  as well as volatility in the short term projects 
demand for services in the bs s segments is also expected to suffer due to the global economic situation 
during fiscal  the company s gos and bs s revenue was negatively impacted by currency fluctuations 
while exchange rates have stabilized recently  currency movements continue to be a major influence on results and the company is unable to predict such changes 
with limited opportunities for revenue growth expected  management intends to increase its focus on operating income margin in fiscal management of sg a and other overhead costs  as well as continuing utilization of offshore and nearshore cost centers  is expected to mitigate margin pressure from lower revenue 
the company also will continue its focus on cash management  though fiscal free cash flow is not expected to match that of fiscal the fiscal achievement benefited from a six day improvement in dso which is not anticipated to recur in fiscal also  the company anticipates the relatively low capital expenditures made in fiscal will not be maintained in fiscal fiscal free cash flow also benefited from realized gains on foreign currency hedging programs 
such gains or losses are dependent on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates which the company is unable to predict 
however  the company continues to target free cash flow to approximate of net income

bs s consulting segment revenue increased million  or during fiscal  and excluding the effect of currency 
approximately million of the growth came from consulting and systems integration operations in north america  driven by the million from the acquisition of fcg 
a slight drop in remaining north american operations was due to a decrease in staff utilization rates which were only partially offset by improved billing rates 
european operations primarily comprised the remainder of the bss consulting increase  despite adverse currency movements 
the higher growth came from new project work as well as increased scope at existing customers

fiscal revenue from the bs s segments operations for fiscal increased approximately million or compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue was primarily the result of the acquisitions of covansys corporation and fcg which contributed approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal growth in europe consulting and systems integration operations contributed million in additional revenue 
bs s consulting segment revenue increased during fiscal or excluding the effects of currency 
the increase in revenue was the result of achievement of revenue milestones on the nhs contract  which contributed million of revenue growth during fiscal  and growth on project work in the west and central regions of europe as a result of increases in hourly billing rates 
the growth in revenue in europe was partially offset by a decline in revenue for consulting and systems integration operations in north america of approximately million as a result of a decline in utilization rates and headcount which was partially offset by an increase in the hourly billing rate and the acquisition of fcg which contributed million of revenue during fiscal bs s financial services sector segment revenue increased approximately million during fiscal in north america increases in business process outsourcing activities and consulting services more than offset declines in sales of software licenses resulting in an increase in revenue of approximately million

global outsourcing services fiscal gos segment revenue declined million in fiscal  or  but was up 
when excluding foreign currency effects of over million 
on a constant currency basis  increased revenue in europe million  australia million and asia million offset declines in north america million 
the higher international revenue was due to the full year effects of new fiscal contracts as well as scope extensions on others 
european growth of million was mostly offset by the impact of renegotiating terms of certain existing contracts and a contract conclusion totaling million 
in north america  contract conclusions of million and scope reductions on existing contracts of million more than offset new fiscal and annualized fiscal wins of million and the full year impact of the fiscal fcg acquisition of million

outsourcing services revenue in europe also benefited from growth on existing contracts which provided million of revenue during fiscal australia and asia provided approximately million and million of revenue growth in outsourcing services during fiscal with the growth primarily from existing engagements 
the decline in revenue in north america was the result of the end of contracts with a local government and a hospital company and reduction in base line rates on certain existing contracts as these contracts mature 
north american public sector the company s north american public sector segment revenues were derived from the following sources fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions amount percent change amount percent change amount department of defense civil agencies other total north american public sector other revenues consist of foreign  state and local government work as well as commercial contracts performed by the north american public sector segment 
fiscal nps sector segment revenue increased million or to  million for fiscal the revenue growth was the result of new business awarded during fiscal and  increases on existing department of defense contracts  and an acquisition 
acquisition of a logistics engineering business contributed million to revenue growth for fiscal this growth was partially offset by revenue reductions due to concluding contracts and reductions on other programs 
the nps continued to win significant new business during fiscal with announced new us federal contract awards of billion 
department of defense revenue increased million or to  million for fiscal growth was the result of new contracts for analysis  engineering  surveillance and reconnaissance support for the us army 
the company benefited from significant contracts involving the expansion of field operations vehicles and strategic planning and management for the missile defense agency 
the company also benefited from new contracts to provide application hosting  system engineering  software development  and web applications services for an intelligence contract 
under a task order valued at million  the company also engaged in professional services support for the naval sea systems engineering directorate 
this growth was partially offset by the end of certain programs 
civil agencies revenue decreased million  or  versus fiscal  primarily as a result of reduced activity and the end of certain programs with nasa 
other nps revenue decreased million  or  versus fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of client budget constraints and delayed commitments from clients 
fiscal department of defense revenue increased million or to  million for fiscal growth was the result of continuing demand for equipment procurement and installation services for the us army with a new procurement contract  increased scope and task orders on a program to provide systems integration services to the us army  a new program to provide systems integration and equipment installation services to the us air force  an increase in task orders on a program to provide programs and software engineering to the missile defense agency  increased task orders on a program to provide management services for certain intelligence services and additional task orders on a program to provide it engineering services to the us navy 
these new programs and tasking provided approximately million in revenue growth for fiscal this growth was partially offset by the end of a classified program and a program to provide system development services to the us army and the loss of contracts to provide maintenance and support services which combined provided additional revenue of approximately million in the prior year 
in addition  on certain programs funds were redirected to other procurement programs and revenue declined on these programs as a consequence 
civil agencies revenue  excluding acquisitions  decreased million  or  versus fiscal  primarily as a result of reduced activity and the end of certain programs with nasa 
these decreases were offset by the acquisition at the end of the third quarter of the prior year of an identity management and credentialing business which contributed million to revenue growth in fiscal work performed by the north american public sector for state and local governments as well as commercial clients was million for fiscal  an increase of million from the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of a new contract with a non governmental aid organization which contributed million of revenue during fiscal costs and expenses the company s costs and expenses were as follows dollar amount percentage of revenue dollars in millions costs of services excludes depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment interest expense  net special items other expense income total fiscal historically  the company has substantially matched revenues and costs in the same currency 
however  the company is increasing its use of offshore support and therefore is increasingly exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal improved slightly to from in fiscal offsetting a cost of services ratio decrease of 
in fiscal was a selling  general and administrative sg a expense ratio increase in equal amount  which was a result of relatively higher marketing and branding costs  development of new service offerings  relocation of the company s headquarters  client targeting  and increased amounts charged to allowance for doubtful accounts 
the depreciation and amortization ratio declined slightly due to less capital expenditure 
the interest expense ratio increased as a result of fiscal s fourth quarter term debt offering to replace commercial paper and the drawdown of the credit facility during fiscal the company also incurred a goodwill impairment charge as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other expense of million was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses 
in fiscal  the company had net gains in foreign currency and also had gains from the sale of non operating assets 
see notes and for further discussion of the company s foreign currency hedging program 
fiscal costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal decreased points to from for fiscal primarily as a result of a reduction in costs incurred for restructuring activities during fiscal  accounting for points 
the cost of services ratio increased primarily as a result of an estimate to complete adjustment on a contract with a us government agency 
the sg a expense ratio decreased as a result of the impact of restructuring activities  a reduction in bid and proposal costs due to a number of contract renewals in the prior year  and the acquisition of covansys corporation which has a lower cost ratio than the company s legacy business 
the depreciation and amortization ratio was essentially unchanged from the prior year 
the interest expense ratio decreased as a result of two offsetting factors beginning in fiscal the classification of income tax related interest expense as income tax expense as a result of the adoption of fin which in fiscal and was included in interest expense  and additional borrowings of billion to finance the acquisitions of covansys and fcg 
other income increased due to gains from the sale of non operating assets which offset a decline in foreign currency exchange gains 
costs of services fiscal costs of services as a percentage of revenue decreased 
points to for fiscal  primarily driven by improvements in the gos  nps and bss other segments 
gos operations in europe benefited from the prior years restructuring program as well as improved performance on certain large accounts 
the improvements in europe more than offset higher costs as a percentage of revenue in the gos americas region  which were driven primarily from impairments of approximately million for deferred contract and other costs associated with two contracts 
the nps segment ratio for fiscal improved as fiscal s results included charges on a fixed price contract with the irs of million as noted below 
absent the fiscal charge  the ratio was virtually unchanged 
in the bs s other segment  improvements in csc india were driven primarily by the weakening of the rupee during fiscal which reduced costs on us dollar denominated contracts 
fiscal costs of services as a percentage of revenue increased 
points to for fiscal as a result of an increase in the north american public sector segment ratio of points to and a point increase in the bs s other segment to 
the increase in the cost of services ratio for the north american public sector segment was primarily due to an estimate to complete adjustment in civil agencies while the increase in the ratio for bs s other was from growth in a staffing business which has lower operating margins than the other operations within bs s other segment which include consulting and systems integration services and business process outsourcing 
the nps segment ratio for fiscal increased 
points primarily as a result of charges recorded on a fixed price contract with the irs 
as the result of amending a fixed priced contract with the irs the company recorded a forward loss and reduced pre contract costs related to the contract to their estimated recoverable amount 
the combined charge was million 
the impact of this charge was partially offset by the improvement in the margin on a fixed price contract and cost reduction initiatives undertaken during fiscal the gos segment ratio decreased to primarily as a result of the impact of the restructuring plan in europe where the ratio improved 
the ratio in north america was adversely affected by a million charge to resolve a dispute with a customer regarding a receivable 
the adverse impact of the charge was partially offset by the termination of certain lower margin contracts 
the bs s line of business cost of services ratio for fiscal increased approximately 
the ratio in the bs s other segment increased approximately as a result of an increase in the ratio in australia where revenue growth in a lower margin professional staffing business increased the ratio for the segment 
the bs s financial services sector segment ratio increased points due primarily to a decrease in license sales  which attract minimal cost of services charges  in the united states and in europe 
the ratio for the bs s consulting segment also increased as the result of an increase in its north america operations ratio due to a decrease in the utilization rate from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 
points to for fiscal primarily due to increases in corporate and gos segment sg a 
gos sg a as a percentage of revenue increased approximately points in fiscal versus fiscal in the europe and north american regions 
the higher gos costs were driven by increases in allowances for bad debt expense  business development expenses  customer relationships management  and costs incurred to introduce the new csc brand in europe 
the customer relationship costs and branding efforts were part of the company s roll out of project accelerate in fiscal corporate g a expenses as a percentage of revenue increased points in fiscal versus fiscal  and related to the roll out of the new csc brand and costs incurred to relocate the company s headquarters 
partly offsetting the higher sg a cost percentages was an improvement of 
points in the nps segment 
fiscal sg a expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 
points to for fiscal the improvement in the ratio was attributed to three factors the restructuring activities in the bs s segments  primarily in the bs s financial services sector segment  where the ratio improved by 
points  lower bid and proposal costs in gos segment in australia which had a number of contracts up for re bid in the prior year  and the acquisition of covansys corporation in the bs s other segment during the second quarter which had a lower selling  general and administrative expense ratio than the company s previously existing businesses 
the nps segment ratio was essentially flat to the prior year with a slight increase in the ratio due to increased bid and proposal costs in fiscal at the corporate level the company incurred professional services costs as a result of the adoption of fin and the restatement of the prior year financial statements 
however  these costs were approximately the same as costs incurred during fiscal related to the stock option investigation and did not result in a significant change in the expense ratio 
depreciation and amortization fiscal depreciation and amortization d a expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 
points to during fiscal the primary driver for the decrease was a favorable mix shift towards a lower revenue volume in gos relative to the other segments 
gos d a as a percentage of revenue is in excess of as compared to the consolidated average of and in fiscal and  respectively 
as gos revenue declined from of total csc revenue to from fiscal to  the consolidated d a percentage of revenue improved accordingly 
the expense ratio also improved slightly in nps  which had a lower than average ratio of and in fiscal and  respectively  and which had a larger proportionate share of revenues year over year from up to 
the nps improvement resulted from reductions in capital expenditures  and reduced amortization of transition costs and customer intangibles 
the bs s financial services segment also had improved performance in the north america region as d a improved from to of revenues  primarily driven by lower amortization on internally developed software and the absence of fiscal depreciation on a building sold at the end of fiscal fiscal depreciation and amortization expense of billion for fiscal represents of revenue and was essentially unchanged from the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense was stable  as a percentage of revenue for the nps sector segment 
the nps sector segment depreciation and amortization expense ratio was unchanged from the level as expenses increased at approximately the same rate as revenues which increased by 
the gos segment ratio declined 
from the prior year ratio primarily as a result of the termination of the sears and nortel networks contracts which required significant investment in equipment 
the bs s segments ratio increased 
points as a result of an increase in the ratio of in the bs s consulting segment due to investment in the nhs contract in europe and the amortization of customer intangibles from the fcg acquisition  an increase in the bs s other segment ratio of due to the acquisition of covansys and the amortization of customer intangibles 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the ratio for the bs s financial services sector segment of 
due to reductions in new asset purchases 
goodwill impairment goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in our second quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company tested the recoverability of goodwill as part of its annual review with no indication of impairment 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company s stock price fluctuated  which the company believes is due to the uncertainty related to the global economy and overall stock market volatility 
as a result  the company s market capitalization was frequently less than its net book value during the third and fourth quarters 
at january   the company evaluated all relevant factors and determined an interim impairment test was not necessary 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company undertook its fiscal budgeting process and at the end of the quarter  having substantially completed its budgeting process  determined that the expected cash flows for certain reporting units were significantly less than the estimated cash flows utilized in the fiscal annual impairment test 
management concluded these factors were a triggering event indicating potential impairment and performed an impairment test of goodwill 
based on the results of the interim impairment test conducted at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an million goodwill impairment charge  equal to the carrying amount of the goodwill attributable to the csa reporting unit 
there were no other significant intangible assets attributed to the csa reporting nor were any other long lived assets attributable to that reporting unit determined to be impaired 
csa  a value added reseller and provider of installation  warranty  and maintenance services in respect of it equipment  is included in the bs s other reportable segment

interest expense and interest income fiscal the increase in interest expense for fiscal of million compared to fiscal was primarily a result of the issuance of debt for a combined billion in fiscal to finance the acquisitions of covansys corporation and fcg 
interest expense for these notes and commercial paper was approximately million for fiscal  an increase from million in fiscal approximately million of the remaining interest expense increase was due to the billion draw down in the credit facility in october to repay commercial paper and increase the company s liquidity position 
the lower commercial paper outstanding and the maturity of the million senior notes in april resulted in lower interest expense which partially offset the increase 
in addition  higher borrowings in europe to fund working capital requirements and additional capital leases in nps contributed to interest expense 
interest income increased approximately million as a result of an increase in cash balances from the drawdown of the credit facility as well as higher cash balances in india 
fiscal the decrease in interest expense for fiscal of million compared to fiscal was primarily due to the election to classify interest on tax related income tax liabilities of million on the income tax expense line upon the adoption of fin during fiscal the prior year periods have not been adjusted to reflect this change in classification and include tax related interest of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
partially offsetting this classification change was interest on billion of commercial paper  subsequently converted to senior notes  issued to finance the acquisition of covansys corporation and fcg corporation 
the issuance of the commercial paper and the senior notes resulted in additional interest expense of approximately million for fiscal interest income decreased by approximately million for fiscal as a result of a decline in cash balances and income from securities sold in the prior year 
special items no special items were recorded during fiscal year special items totaling million were recorded during fiscal and consisted of a million restructuring charge see discussion below  and a million charge related to the retirement of the company s chairman and chief executive officer recorded during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  special items totaling million were recorded and consisted of a million restructuring charge see discussion below  a year to date million true up of an estimate related to the fiscal nortel impairment charge and an million gain from the redemption of dyncorp international preferred stock recorded during the first quarter of fiscal restructuring in april  the company announced a restructuring plan to be carried out during fiscal and the objectives of the plan were to streamline csc s worldwide operations and leverage the increased use of lower cost global resources 
restructuring charges consisted predominantly of severance and related employee payments resulting from terminations 
during the third quarter of fiscal the company evaluated facility consolidation opportunities and other areas where operations could be streamlined and costs reduced consistent with the plan objectives  resulting in additional lease termination  asset impairment and other charges 
workforce reductions  including some voluntary terminations  in fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively 
the company did not record any termination related restructuring charges as special items in fiscal termination related charges were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
other costs  which were primarily related to vacant space  of million and million were also recorded during fiscal and  respectively 
all of the restructuring charge in fiscal was incurred in the bs s segments 
restructuring charges of million were recorded in fiscal year the restructuring plan generated savings of approximately million in fiscal against a plan of million and compares to savings of approximately million in fiscal approximately of the savings come from reduced cost of services  while the remainder will be predominantly from lower selling  general and administrative costs 
savings are net of new or increased recurring costs  primarily the costs anticipated for an increasing offshore workforce 
savings are also impacted by certain transitional costs as new offshore staff are trained while outgoing staff are still on the payroll 
such transitional costs were 
and million for fiscal and  respectively 
a majority of the planned headcount reductions took place in europe 
for fiscal  european headcount decreased by approximately compared to  in fiscal approximately reductions were made in north america in fiscal compared to  in the prior year 
the balance of the reductions occurred in australia and asia 
restructuring related pre tax cash payments for fiscal  and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
included in the restructuring charges are pension benefit augmentations that are due to certain employees in accordance with legal or contractual obligations  which will be paid out over several years as part of normal pension distributions 
such liabilities are included in the consolidated pension liability account 
see the following table for a summary of fiscal in millions liability as of march  less payments other restructuring liability as of april  workforce reductions other total primarily foreign currency translation adjustments

other expense income dollars in millions foreign currency loss gain gain loss on sale of non operating assets total other expense income the company reported other expense of million for fiscal compared with million of other income in fiscal and million of other income for fiscal other expense income is comprised primarily of foreign currency gains and losses on intra company balances and gains and losses on sale of non operating assets  as well as costs associated with the company s hedging program 
of the reported million currency loss in fiscal  million was due to hedging costs 
the remaining loss of million is due to the unhedged currency exposure 
foreign currency net gains and losses for fiscal  and were the result of the effect of currency rate movements  primarily between the us dollar and the euro  british pound sterling  and australian dollar and between the euro and the british pound sterling 
the gain on sale of non operating assets during fiscal included the sale of a building in austin  tx  in march for a gain of approximately million pre tax and the sale of available for sale securities for a gain of approximately million pre tax 
taxes the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal years  and was  and  respectively 
as a global enterprise  our tax rates are affected by many factors  including our global mix of earnings  the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states  legislation  acquisitions  dispositions and tax characteristics of our income 
our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 
our effective tax rate decreased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a million reduction in uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  due to audit settlements with the us internal revenue service irs 
the company also filed accounting method changes during the second quarter of fiscal year and had settlements with certain state and foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to the impact of income tax credits and the classification of tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense as a result of the adoption of fin on march  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the foreign effective tax rates during fiscal year  the remeasurement of tax  penalties and interest for tax matters relating to fiscal years to  and changes in accounting methods 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the irs concluded its examination of the company s consolidated us tax returns for the fiscal years through the nature of the significant items subject to examination included depreciation and amortization  research credits and international tax issues 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company also filed various accounting method changes with the irs 
as a result of the conclusion of the irs examination and the filing of accounting method changes  the company recorded reductions of approximately million in the liability for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest and penalties 
of the reductions in liability for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest and penalties  approximately million was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense 
additionally  million  million and million of uncertain tax positions were reclassified on the company s balance sheet from liability for uncertain tax positions to deferred tax liabilities  taxes payable and other balance sheet accounts  respectively 
as of april   the company s liability for uncertain tax positions was million  including interest of million  penalties of million and net of tax carryforwards of million 
during the year ended april   the company accrued an interest benefit of million million net of tax and had a net release of penalties of million 
this interest amount includes the effect of new uncertain tax positions recognized in fiscal year on january   the company paid a million bond to the irs related to certain tax matters 
as a result  tax related interest for these tax matters stopped accruing as of the date of the bond payment 
a more detailed analysis of differences between the us federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate  as well as other information about our income tax provision  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
earnings per share and share base earnings per share eps from continuing operations for fiscal increased to from in fiscal eps was favorably impacted by significantly higher net income and a decrease in the average share base of million shares from fiscal the higher net income resulted from an increase in revenue of and income before tax margin of points compared to the prior year  as well as the million tax benefit in fiscal versus tax expense of million in fiscal other significant contributing elements were fiscal s special items and the change in other expense income from year over year 
the average share base reduction was due to the full year effect of the share purchase program and a reduction in the dilutive effect of stock options partially offset by the exercise of million employee stock options during the prior year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase transactions 
financial condition cash flows dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal net cash from operations net cash used in investing net cash from used in financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year the company significantly increased its net cash balance during fiscal operating cash flow increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher net income and higher collections of accounts receivable  partially offset by decreases in income tax liabilities 
cash used in investing activities decreased billion primarily due to the prior year acquisitions of covansys corporation and first consulting group which required a use of cash of billion 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  a decrease of million with several offsetting factors described below 
operating cash flow net cash from operating activities for fiscal of  million represents an increase of million versus the prior year 
significant factors in these results are described below 
a million increase in net income 
a reduction in receivables provided cash of million in the reduction is primarily attributable to the company s nps and gos operations resulting from a fiscal initiative to reduce dso  as well as resolution of certain contract disputes and several contract completions 
increases in prepaid expenses and other assets required a use of cash of million in the increase was primarily due to work in progress on the company s significant contract with the uk national health service nhs 
decreases in accounts payable and accruals required use of cash in fiscal of million 
the decrease primarily resulted from timing of bs s consulting subcontractor payments  and vendor payments in bs s other regions 
increases in deferred income and advance payments provided cash of million for fiscal the increases primarily resulted from higher advances on the company s engagement with nhs tied to expected activity levels 
a decrease in income taxes payable and liability of cash of million  included a non cash component for fiscal during fiscal  the company reached resolutions with the irs and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
as a result of these settlements  the company s income tax payments decreased million in fiscal to million 
additionally  the settlements resulted in a non cash benefit related to the reduction of uncertain tax liabilities 
also impacting the fiscal comparison of operating cash flows to the prior year was million of unrealized foreign currency losses compared to million of gains for fiscal net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal of  million represents a decrease of million versus fiscal significant factors in these results included the following for  increases in receivables required a use of cash of million  primarily from increases in unbilled receivables resulting from timing of work performed in gos and long term contracts 
a five day increase in days sales outstanding for from was due to new business awards in europe  increased unbilled on the nhs contract  and the dilutive nature of the mid year acquisitions during the cash flow impact of changes in prepaid expenses and other assets was a use of cash of million for fiscal the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was the result of increases in work in process balances for fiscal of million  primarily in europe and the payment of a million bond to the irs to stop the accrual of interest on certain tax liabilities 
activity in accounts payable and certain accrued expenses resulted in a use of cash of approximately million during fiscal accounts payable and certain accrued expenses decreased million from the prior year due to the reversal of income tax related interest and penalties accrued under fas prior to fiscal and the accrual of the income tax related interest and penalties as a tax liability as a result of the adoption of fin the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was partially offset in cash flow by an increase in accrued payroll of approximately million primarily due to timing of payments 
activity in deferred income and advance payments provided cash inflow of approximately million for fiscal the increase was related to advance contract payments in europe and the united states as well as sales of software licenses 
the cash flow impact from changes in income tax liabilities and assets was a cash inflow of approximately million for fiscal additions to taxes payable during fiscal were somewhat offset by payments to tax authorities during the year of approximately million 
investing cash flow the company s capital investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and purchases and development of software  and deferred outsourcing contract costs that have supported the company s expanding gos segment operations in prior years 
investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades  expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets 
for cash flow presentation purposes  the outsourcing contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet 
outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contract s acquisition or start up  including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets 
investing cash outflows decreased to  million during fiscal compared to  million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the fiscal acquisitions of covansys and fcg  which required a use of cash of billion  as well as a million reduction in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
investing cash outflows increased approximately billion for fiscal compared to the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of covansys and fcg 
the remaining increase was driven by higher purchases of computer equipment and deferred outsourcing contracts costs of million and million  respectively 
the increase in equipment was as a result of replacements on contracts in europe and the united states while the increase in deferred outsourcing costs was as a result of new contracts in europe and in the north american public sector 
future capital investments will depend on levels of new business and the mix of that business 
contracts in the nps and bs s segments typically require lower levels of initial investment compared to contracts in the gos segment 
financing cash flow cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal and a decrease of million from fiscal the inflow was primarily due to a draw down on a billion credit facility 
csc took this action to eliminate its reliance on the commercial paper market 
partially offsetting the financing cash inflows were repayments of million of maturing long term debt  and repayment of commercial paper 
fiscal cash provided by financing activities increased billion from the prior year 
the inflow was primarily from the issuance of approximately billion of commercial paper  billion of which was refinanced with issuance of the million senior notes due and billion senior notes due this inflow was partially offset by outflows of billion to acquire outstanding common stock 
liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was  million at april   and million at march   and  million at march  during fiscal  shareholder s equity increased million 
the positive impact of net earnings of  million was largely offset by two negative factors 
first  foreign currency translation movements caused a million decrease as the us dollar strengthened sharply 
second  the company recorded an unfunded pension obligation increase  reducing accumulated other comprehensive income by million 
recognition of stock based compensation expense and stock option exercises added million to stockholders equity 
at the end of fiscal  csc s ratio of debt to total capitalization was  up from at the end of fiscal  and from at the end of fiscal the increase in the debt ratio for fiscal was primarily the result of the draw down of the billion line of credit 
the increase in the debt ratio for fiscal was the result of the issuance of billion of commercial paper which was converted into long term notes during fiscal to fund the acquisitions of covansys and fcg  the issuance of approximately million of commercial paper during the fourth quarter to fund the completion of the b share repurchase plan  and the decrease in shareholders equity resulting from the b share repurchase 
the following table summarizes the company s debt to total capitalization ratios as of fiscal year ends  and dollars in millions april  march  march  debt equity total capitalization debt to total capitalization during fiscal  the company purchased and retired approximately million outstanding common shares through a b share repurchase plan approved by the company s board of directors at a cost of approximately billion 
this transaction was financed through available cash on hand and the issuance of approximately million of commercial paper which is no longer outstanding 
at april   the company had million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks  million of current maturities and  million of long term debt 
the company had no outstanding commercial paper as of april  at march   the company had million of short term borrowings  million of current maturities of long term debt and  million of long term debt 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  commercial paper is classified as short term borrowings 
the company had million of outstanding commercial paper as of march  on july   the company entered into a new committed line of credit providing billion of long term commercial paper backup 
the line of credit expires on july  on october   the company borrowed billion under the line of credit 
the proceeds from the drawdown of the line of credit were used primarily to repay maturing commercial paper and repay million of maturing debt 
the company discontinued its issuance of commercial paper after october   and as of april   the company had no commercial paper outstanding 
this line requires the company to limit liens placed on our assets to million and to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business  maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such period not to be less than to  the company is in full compliance with these requirements  and not permit at the end of any quarterly financial reporting period the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date  to exceed to 
as of april   the company s total liquidity was approximately billion which included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as of april   the company had billion borrowed under the credit facility and was in compliance with all terms of the agreement 
liquidity risk the company is exposed to liquidity risk from operations and from the company s ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets 
the company s exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts 
the recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon the company s performance as well as customer acceptance 
an example is the contract with the united kingdom s nhs to deliver an integrated electronic patient records system with an announced value of billion billion 
this is a large and complex contract 
as of april   the company had a net investment in the contract of approximately million 
contract assets consist principally of contract work in progress and unbilled receivables but also equipment  software and other assets 
these are partially offset by liabilities for deferred revenue and advanced payments 
the contract is profitable and the company expects to recover its investment  however  unforeseen future events to the extent they add costs beyond those included in the company s current estimated costs to complete  could potentially adversely impact such recovery and the company s liquidity 
the company s ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets is dependent on liquidity in the credit markets as well as the company s financial position 
the company was successful in issuing billion of long term debt as a private placement under rule a during the fourth quarter of fiscal this debt was then converted to publicly traded debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities and cash balances 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company was able to access the debt capital markets utilizing a rule a offering  as noted above  which was then converted to publicly traded debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal however  there can be no assurances the company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the expiration of the company s financial guarantees outstanding as of april  dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total performance guarantees surety bonds letters of credit standby letters of credit foreign subsidiary debt guarantees total see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the following table summarizes the company s payments on contractual obligations by period as of april  dollars in millions less than year years years more than years total long term debt interest on fixed rate debt capital lease obligations bank debt operating leases minimum purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the company adopted fin on march  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined 
regarding minimum purchase obligations included above  the company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software  hardware  telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing  committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities 
the company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years 
if the company does not meet the specified service minimums  the company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall 
the above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the company has numerous plans  both inside and outside of the us  and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis 
the minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors  and can be zero in some years 
funding is determined based on a review of benefit obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including erisa and cost accounting standards cas applied to us government contracts 
while there are certain minimum contribution requirements  csc may elect to increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors including performance of pension investments  changes in workforce composition and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts 
during fiscal  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million to pension and million postretirement benefit plans 
the company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets  which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations 
refer to the critical accounting estimates section later in this md a and to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in fiscal company pension and other pension benefits contributions amounted to million  a decrease of million from million in fiscal see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
dividends and redemption it has been the company s policy to invest earnings in the growth of the company rather than distribute earnings as dividends 
this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to review by the board of directors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues 
changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified several critical accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term  fixed price contracts  revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization  capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs  estimates used to determine deferred income taxes  assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill  assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities  and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates 
revenue from our fixed unit price contracts  time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time 
however  for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting  which is less than eight percent of the company s revenues  the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation 
under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other output based measures are achieved 
costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved 
the method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers  program managers and financial professionals 
key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
our management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates 
modifications to contract scope  schedule  and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery 
if recovery is deemed probable  we may  as appropriate  either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance 
we routinely negotiate such contract modifications 
many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers 
the total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based on relative fair value 
these relative fair values are determined based on objective evidence of fair value 
once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements  revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered 
estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume difference  changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 
revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization if significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product  revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above 
thus  cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project  and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results 
capitalization of outsourcing contract costs certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition set up costs  and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection  costs associated with installation of systems and processes  and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premiums 
finance staff  working with program management  review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance 
key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs 
we utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management  operations  procurement and finance areas  as well as third parties on occasion  to determine fair values of assets acquired 
to assess recoverability  undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to contract related assets  including the unamortized deferred cost balance 
such estimates require judgment and assumptions  which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel 
key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies 
a significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software 
significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives  estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues  and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment 
for commercial software products  determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products 
we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues  including an assessment of alternative solutions or products  current and historical demand for the product  and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 
for internal use software  the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis 
to assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs  we must estimate future revenue  costs and cash flows 
such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows  and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff 
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 
estimates used to determine income tax expense we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also must analyze income tax reserves  as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained under examination 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments in our determination of acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include target integration liabilities as well as litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining their fair values 
independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations can be based on significant estimates provided by the company  such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by company professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  program management and other disciplines 
changes in assumptions and estimates during the allocation period related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the recorded values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual results versus estimates  could result in material impacts to earnings 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and reductions in growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  an impairment of goodwill may exist 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach  which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method 
in applying the discounted cash flow method  the estimated future cash flows and terminal values for each reporting unit are discounted to a present value using a weighted average cost of capital 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  the company applied discount rates ranging from  based on the specific risk characteristics of each reporting unit 
the company s cash flow projections also incorporate management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including revenue growth rates  operating margins  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the fair values of reporting units estimated under the income approach are assessed by comparing those values to fair value estimates derived using a market approach 
a market approach estimates fair value by applying performance metric multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting unit derived in the market approach is significantly different from the fair value estimated in the income approach  the company reevaluates and  if necessary  adjusts the assumptions used in the income approach 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step of the impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
see discussion of fiscal goodwill impairment charge in the results of operations section in this management s discussion and analysis as well as note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company tested the recoverability of goodwill as part of its annual review with no indication of impairment 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company s stock price was subject to significant fluctuation  which the company believes is due to the uncertainty related to the global economy and overall stock market volatility 
as a result  the company s market capitalization was frequently less than its net book value during the third and fourth quarters 
at january   the company evaluated all relevant factors and determined an interim impairment test was not necessary 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company undertook its fiscal budgeting process and at the end of the quarter  having substantially completed its budgeting process  determined that the expected cash flows for certain reporting units were significantly less than the estimated cash flows utilized in the fiscal annual impairment test 
management concluded these factors were a triggering event indicating potential impairment and performed an impairment test of goodwill as of april  based on the results of the step one interim impairment test  there was an indication that an impairment may exist for one reporting unit csa and the second step was performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment for csa goodwill was determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill 
based on the results of the interim impairment test conducted at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an million goodwill impairment charge  equal to the carrying amount of the goodwill attributable to the csa reporting unit 
there were no other significant intangible assets attributed to the csa reporting unit nor were any other long lived assets attributable to that reporting unit determined to be impaired 
the reporting unit fair values determined in the step one income approach were used to derive an enterprise value of the company 
the company performed a reconciliation of the enterprise value for the reporting units to the company s market capitalization and concluded that the fair value results determined for the reporting units were reasonable 
the estimated market capitalization considers recent trends in market capitalization and an expected control premium  based on comparable transactional history 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates  operating margins  terminal growth rates  capital expenditures  as well as discount rates 
estimates involve the assessment of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts  estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs  and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of each reporting unit 
although we have consistently used the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain and can vary from actual results 
in light of current economic conditions  additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the reporting units fair values would result in no additional reporting units failing step one 
assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities we offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans 
csc utilizes actuarial methods required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
for fiscal  and  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans 
two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions  we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates 
changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each plan  the asset mix of the plan  historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors 
the weighted average of the expected long term rates of return  for all plans  on plan assets utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation 
the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
the weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately million  or increased it by approximately million  respectively 
some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts 
the accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur 
for example  while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns  differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year 
such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time 
for csc  market returns caused actual pension plan asset returns to lag those expected in fiscal and  respectively 
rising discount rates in fiscal  which resulted in lower benefit obligation growth  served to offset the negative impact of poor asset returns for fiscal rising discount rates in fiscal and  which resulted in lower calculated benefit obligation growth  served to partially enhance the impact of positive asset returns in fiscal and for fiscal and  sfas no 
requires recognition of a pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the projected benefit obligation pbo at the end of the year 
at the end of fiscal  a number of our pension plans had pbos in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets  due mostly to poor pension asset performance  higher pension obligations were recognized in than in the effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement in fiscal was to increase pension liability by million  decrease non current asset by million  and increase accumulated comprehensive loss by million million net of taxes 
for fiscal  a number of our pension plans had pbos in excess of their plan assets fair value 
however  due to higher discount rates  lower pension obligations were recognized in than in the effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement in fiscal was to decrease pension liability by million  increase non current asset by million  and decrease accumulated comprehensive loss by million million net of taxes 
based on future plan asset performance and interest rates  additional charges to equity might be required 
assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
csc consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows and fair value of fixed rate debt 
foreign currency as a large global organization the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received 
short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
by generally matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
however  as the company has increased its use of offshore support it has become more exposed to currency fluctuations 
the company established policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using foreign currency forwards to hedge intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities 
these financial instruments are generally short term in nature with typical maturities of less than one year 
in addition  the company uses these instruments as economic hedges and not for speculative or trading purposes 
for accounting purposes  these foreign currency contracts do not qualify as cash flow hedges and all changes in fair value are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses 
in fiscal year  the company entered into foreign currency options to manage their exposure to the economic risk from movements in the rupee against the us dollar from the company s offshore support base in india 
during fiscal  of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
in order to provide an assessment of the company s foreign currency exchange rate risk  the company uses sensitivity analysis to determine the effects on the fair value of our hedge portfolio 
given a hypothetical increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies  revenue would decrease by or million  while a hypothetical decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the company s earnings before interest and taxes by million 
this amount would be offset  in part  from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense 
at april   the company had approximately  million of non us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
