we are a global medical device company engaged in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of laser and other light based aesthetics systems for practitioners worldwide 
we offer products on three platforms coolglide  xeo and solera for use by physicians and other qualified practitioners to allow our customers to offer safe and effective aesthetic treatments to their customers 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in brisbane  california  where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research  regulatory  sales  service  marketing and administrative activities 
in the 
table of contents united states  we market  sell and service our products primarily through direct sales and service employees and through a distribution relationship with pss world medical shared services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of pss world medical  or pss  which has over sales representatives serving physician offices throughout the united states 
in addition  we also sell certain items  like titan hand piece refills and marketing brochures  through the internet 
international sales are generally made through direct sales employees and through a worldwide distributor network in over countries 
outside the united states  we have a direct sales presence in australia  canada  france  japan  spain  switzerland and the united kingdom 
products 
our revenue is derived from the sale of products  product upgrades  service  and titan hand piece refills 
product revenue represents the sale of a system  which consists of one or more hand pieces and a console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface  a laser and or other light based module  control system software and high voltage electronics 
however  depending on the application  the laser or other light based module is sometimes instead contained in the hand piece  such as with our pearl and pearl fractional products  instead of in the console 
we offer our customers the ability to select the system that best fits their practice at the time of purchase and then to cost effectively add applications to their system as their practice grows 
this enables customers to upgrade their systems whenever they want and provides us with a source of recurring revenue  which we classify as product upgrade revenue 
service revenue relates to amortization of prepaid service contract revenue and receipts for services on out of warranty products 
titan hand piece refill revenue is associated with our titan hand piece  which requires replacement of the optical source after a set number of pulses have been used 
significant business trends 
we believe that our ability to grow revenue has been  and will continue to be  primarily dependent on the following investments made in our global sales and marketing infrastructure 
continuing introduction of new aesthetic products and applications 
continuing customer demand for our products and consumer demand for the applications they offer 
marketing to physicians in the core dermatology and plastic surgeon specialties  as well as outside those specialties 
generating service  product upgrade and titan hand piece refill revenue from our growing installed base of customers 
in  compared to  our us revenue declined and our international revenue grew 
in  compared to  our us revenue declined  while our international revenue grew 
we believe that the greater decline in us revenue growth from to  as compared from to  was primarily attributable to a us recession that is causing our prospective customers to delay their purchase decisions 
we also believe that those prospects who do not have established medical offices are finding it more difficult to obtain credit financing 
the weaker international revenue growth in  compared to international revenue growth in  was primarily attributable to the global recession  which adversely affected our international revenue in the second half of we experienced greater revenue growth in many of our international markets in  compared with  with particular strength in australia and japan 
as a result of this continuing international revenue growth  international revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to in  compared with in for  our gross margin declined to  compared to in this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced leverage of our manufacturing and service expenses due to lower than expected revenue  and lower introductory margins for our pearl fractional enabled systems and upgrades that started shipping in september  and lower average selling prices for our products and product upgrades in  compared with 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to in  compared to in  but decreased in total dollars to million 
the increase in percentage was primarily caused by lower revenue in  compared with the decrease in total dollars in  compared with  was primarily caused by reduced personnel expenses in the united states due to lower sales commissions  resulting from lower revenue  and lower headcount 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to in  compared to in  and increased in total dollars to million 
these increases were primarily attributable to lower revenue in  compared with  and higher personnel expenses associated with increased headcount 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to in  compared to in  due primarily to lower revenue in  compared with in absolute dollars  g a expenses decreased by  to million in  compared with factors that may impact future performance our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
our industry is highly competitive and our future performance depends on our ability to compete successfully 
additionally  our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearances for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
if we fail to execute on the aforementioned initiatives  our business would be adversely affected 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future performance are provided in part i  item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition we recognize distributor and non distributor revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 

table of contents determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectability of those fees 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or collectability has not been reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue under service contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable service contract 
service revenue  not under a service contract  is recognized as the services are provided 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
long term auction rate securities investments we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities ars that represent investments in pools of student loan assets 
at the time of acquisition  these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
since february  uncertainties in the credit markets affected our ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the issuer refinances their debt 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to as of december   we had million in long term ars investments 
given observable ars market information was not available to determine the fair value of our ars portfolio we compared the fair value of our securities to a discounted cash flow model as well as transaction data and bid ask spread data for other similar illiquid securities from a secondary market 
expected future cash flows were calculated using estimates for interest rates ranging from to  timing and amount of cash flows through the maturity of the ars 
our most significant assumption made in the present value calculations was the estimated required rates of return used to discount the estimated future cash flows 
the rate selected to value each of the investments considered and assigned an expected yield premium based on several factors  including lack of liquidity due to failing auctions  default risk arising from whether the security was issued by a federal backed agency federal family education loan program or a municipal agency maine education loan authority  underlying collateral coverage of the loan trust that issued the security  underlying credit rating  and liquidation preferences based on the capital structure of the loan trust 
for the year ended december   using this assessment of fair value  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million  which was recognized as a pre tax other than temporary impairment charge with a corresponding decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the primary cause of the decline in fair value of our long term ars was an increase in the estimated required rates of return used to discount the estimated future cash flows over the life of each security 
we review our impairments on a quarterly basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  and the sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is 
table of contents recorded as an unrealized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and is a component of the net loss for the applicable accounting period 
once an other than temporary impairment is recorded  a new cost basis in the investment is established 
the primary differentiating factors we considered to classify our impairments between temporary and other than temporary impairments are the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer to maturity to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict factors that may impact its valuation include duration of time that the ars remain illiquid  changes to credit ratings of the securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  changes in the underlying collateral value  market discount rates for similar illiquid investments  and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional other than temporary impairment charges in future quarters 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  liquidity and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional other than temporary impairment charges in future quarters 
fair value measurements on january   we adopted fair value measurement provisions of statement sfas  no 
fair value measurements  which established a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and clarified the definition of fair value within that framework 
sfas does not require assets and liabilities that were previously recorded at cost to be recorded at fair value 
for assets and liabilities that are already required to be disclosed at fair value  sfas introduced  or reiterated  a number of key concepts that form the foundation of the fair value measurement approach to be used for financial reporting purposes 
the fair values of our financial instruments reflect the amounts that we estimate we would receive in connection with the sale of an asset or that we would pay in connection with the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
sfas also established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three levels level prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level unobservable inputs the adoption of sfas did not have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations  but sfas introduced new disclosures about how we value certain assets and liabilities 
much of the disclosure focuses on the inputs used to measure fair value  particularly in instances in which the measurement uses significant unobservable level inputs 
a substantial majority of our financial instruments are level and level assets 
at december   total financial assets measured and recognized at fair value were million and of these assets  million  or  were ars that were measured and recognized using significant unobservable inputs level 
there were no non financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value as of december  while our ars valuation model was based on both level credit quality and interest rates and level inputs  we determined that the level inputs were the most significant to the overall fair value measurement  particularly the estimates of risk adjusted discount rates

table of contents stock based compensation expense under the provisions of fas no 
r  share based payment fas r  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
the expected volatility is a blend of implied and historical volatility 
we have determined that this is a more reflective measure of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility  than its limited historical volatility since the initial public offering of our common stock 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting terminations 
as required under gaap  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
as of december   the unrecognized compensation cost  net of expected forfeitures  related to stock options  restricted stock unit awards and employee stock purchase plan awards was million   and  which will be recognized using the straight line attribution method over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years  years and years  respectively 
see note stockholders equity  stock plans and stock based compensation expense  in the notes to consolidated financial statement in part ii  item of this form k for more information 
valuation of inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored and updated quarterly or as necessary  to reflect changes in raw material costs  labor to manufacture the product and overhead rates 
we provide for excess and obsolete inventories when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory provisions are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value and charged to cost of revenue to establish a lower cost basis for the inventories 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory provisions that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when product that has previously been reserved is sold 
warranty obligations we provide a standard one year or two year warranty coverage on our systems 
warranty coverage provided is for labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale  and as reviewed and updated quarterly  of the total costs that we expect to incur in repairing or replacing product parts that fail while still under warranty 
accrued warranty costs include costs of material  technical support labor and associated overhead 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
for new products  estimates will include historical experience of similar products  as well as reasonable allowance for start up expenses 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future due to actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differing from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which would negatively impact our operating results 

table of contents provision for income taxes we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes on earnings 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of tax exempt interest income  foreign operations  research and development tax credits  state taxes  and certain benefits realized related to stock option activity 
our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes  should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states 
the effective tax rate was in  in and in our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  or by changes in tax laws  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
our deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value  which assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the net carrying value 
the four sources of taxable income to be considered in determining whether a valuation allowance is required include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary requires an analysis of both positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
in general  positive evidence may include a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the deductible temporary differences  coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is the result of an aberration rather than a continuing condition  
table of contents an excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of our net assets in an amount sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset  and in general  negative evidence may include a history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  an expectation of being in a cumulative loss position in a future reporting period  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years  and a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief that it would limit the realization of tax benefits 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified and judgment must be used in considering the relative impact of positive and negative evidence 
in  our loss before income taxes included unrealized capital losses resulting from other than temporary impairment charges for our ars investments 
after considering both the positive and negative evidence as of december   we determined that it was not more likely than not that we would realize the full value of our capital loss related deferred tax assets 
as a result  we established a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset 
at december   we had recognized deferred tax assets of million relating to other temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and tax credit carryforwards 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the carrying value of these deferred tax assets 
we review the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance on a quarterly basis and consider whether positive and negative evidence exists to effect the realization of deferred tax assets 
long lived asset impairment long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not ultimately be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
litigation we have been  and may in the future become  subject to legal proceedings related to securities litigation  intellectual property and other matters such as the tcpa litigation and the securities class action lawsuit described in item legal proceedings 
based on all available information at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable loss 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we record a reserve in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
currently we have no such reserves recorded for any of the litigations mentioned in item legal proceedings

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  fund the planned expansion of our operations and acquire businesses 
our sources of cash include operations  stock option exercises  employee stock purchases and interest income 
we actively manage our cash usage and investment of liquid cash to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our daily needs 
the majority of our cash and investments are held in us banks and our foreign subsidiaries maintain a limited amount of cash in their local banks to cover their short term operating expenses

adequacy of cash resources to meet future needs we had cash  cash equivalents  marketable and long term investments of million as of december  of this amount  we had million invested in long term ars investments see critical accounting estimates section above  for a full description of our long term investments in ars 
we believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  variable interest or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated transactions 
commitments see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
contractual obligations the following are our obligations for future minimum lease commitments related to facility leases as of december  payments due by period s contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases income tax liability we adopted the provisions of fin on january  implementation of fin did not result in any adjustment to our consolidated statements of income or a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings 
as a result of the adoption of fin  as of december   we have included in our consolidated balance sheet million in long term income tax liability with respect to unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
as a result  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above 
purchase commitments we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components 
our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as agreed between the parties 
these forecasted time horizons can vary among different suppliers 
our open inventory purchase commitments were not material at december  as a result  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements that contain a variety of representations  warranties  and indemnification obligations 
for example  we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our 
table of contents directors and executive officers 
in  two of our officers were named as defendants in securities class action litigation see part i  item legal proceedings 
our exposure under the various indemnification obligations  including those under the indemnification agreements with our directors and officers  is unknown since the outcome of the securities litigation is unpredictable and the amount that could be payable thereunder is not reasonably estimable  and since other indemnification obligations involve future claims that may be made against us 
we have not accrued or paid any amounts for any such indemnification obligations 
however  we may record charges in the future as a result of these potential indemnification obligations  including those related to the securities class action litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and municipal bonds  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single type of investment or issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at a weighted average maturity interest reset date for ars of generally less than eighteen months 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio would have potentially declined by approximately  as of december  we hold interest bearing ars that represent investments in pools of student loans issued by either the federal family education loan program or the maine education loan authority 
at the time of acquisition  these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
since february  uncertainties in the credit markets affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have continued to fail 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the ars is refinanced by the issuer into another type of debt instrument 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to we currently classify all of these investments as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet because of our continuing inability to determine when these investments will settle 
we have also modified our current investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market investments  united states treasury securities  municipal bonds  and eliminated investments in corporate debt 
the valuation of our ars investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include  duration of time that the ars remain illiquid  changes to credit ratings of the securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  changes in the underlying collateral value  market discount rates for similar illiquid investments  ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional other than temporary impairment charges in future quarters 
foreign currency exchange risk we have international subsidiaries and operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
although the majority of our revenue and purchases are denominated in us dollars  we have revenue to certain international customers and expenses denominated in the japanese yen  euro  pounds sterling  australian dollars  swiss francs and canadian dollars 
the net gains and losses from the revaluation of foreign 
table of contents denominated assets and liabilities was a loss of  for the year ended december  and is included in operating loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
movements in currency exchange rates could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or interest and other income expense 
though to date our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant  we cannot assure that there will not be a material impact in the future 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments
