item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors or in other parts of this form k 
overview bigband networks  inc was founded in december  and through we were engaged principally in research and development 
we first generated meaningful product revenues in  principally from our initial media processing platform designed for video 
since  we have expanded our customer base to include seven of the ten largest service providers in the us  including brighthouse  cablevision  charter  comcast  cox  time warner cable and verizon 
from through  we experienced significant revenue growth that was derived primarily from cable operators 
beginning in  we commenced sales efforts to telecommunications companies and began recognizing significant revenues from one of these companies in in  we initiated a restructuring plan to retire our cable modem termination system cmts platform and realign our business around video solutions  and in we sold our fastflow provisioning software technology 
our net revenues are influenced by a variety of factors  including the level and timing of capital spending of our customers  and the annual budgetary cycles of  and the timing and amount of orders from  significant customers 
the selling prices of our products vary based upon the particular customer implementation  which impacts the relative mix of software  hardware and services associated with the sale 
our sales cycle typically ranges from six to months  but can be longer  if the sale relates to new product introductions 
our sales cycle process generally involves several stages before we can recognize revenues on the sale of our products 
as a provider of advanced technologies  we seek to actively participate with our existing and potential customers in the evaluation of their technology needs and network architectures  including the development of initial designs and prototypes 
following these activities  we typically respond to a service provider s request for proposal  configure our products to work within our customer s network architecture  and test our products first in laboratory testing and then in field environments to ensure interoperability with existing products in the service provider s network 
following testing  our revenue recognition depends on satisfying complex customer acceptance criteria specified in our contract with the customer and our customer s schedule for roll out of the product 
completion of several of these stages is substantially outside of our control  which causes our revenue patterns from a given customer to vary widely from period to period 
after initial deployment of our products  subsequent purchases of our products typically have a more compressed sales cycle 
due to the nature of the cable and telecommunications industries  we sell our products to a limited number of large customers 
for the years ended december   and  we derived approximately  and 
table of contents  respectively  of our net revenues from our top five customers 
we believe that for the foreseeable future our net revenues will continue to be highly concentrated in a relatively small number of large customers 
the loss of one or more of our large customers  or the cancellation or deferral of purchases by one or more of these customers  would have a material adverse impact on our revenues and operating results 
we sell our products and services to customers in the us and canada through our direct sales force 
we sell to customers internationally through a combination of direct sales and resellers 
in conjunction with our new product introductions  we expect our proportion of international revenues to increase in the future 
net revenues 
we derive our net revenues primarily from sales of  and services for video solutions  with a diminishing contribution from our cmts platform products  previously retired 
our product revenues are comprised of a combination of software licenses and hardware 
our primary video solutions include broadcast video  telcotv and switched digital video 
our data products included high speed data  ip video and voice over ip on our cmts platform  which we retired in october our service revenues include ongoing customer support and maintenance  product installation and training 
our customer support and maintenance is available in a tiered offering at either a standard or enhanced level 
the substantial majority of our customers have purchased our enhanced level of customer support and maintenance 
the accounting for our net revenues is complex and  as discussed below  we account for revenues in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
cost of net revenues 
our cost of product revenues consists primarily of payments for components and product assembly  costs of product testing  provisions recorded for excess and obsolete inventory  provisions recorded for warranty obligations  manufacturing overhead and allocated facilities and information technology expense 
cost of service revenues is primarily comprised of personnel costs in providing technical support  costs incurred to support deployment and installation within our customers networks  training costs and allocated facilities and information technology expense 
we decreased headcount in these functions to employees as of december  from employees as of december  we expect services and manufacturing operations headcount to remain relatively flat in the near term 
gross margin 
our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues  or gross margin  has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of software and hardware sold  the mix of revenue between our products  the average selling prices of our products  and the mix of revenue between products and services 
we achieve a higher gross margin on the software content of our products compared to the hardware content 
in general  we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline over time due to competitive pricing pressures  but we seek to minimize the impact to our gross margins by introducing new products with higher margins  selling software enhancements to existing products  achieving price reductions for components and improving product design to reduce costs 
our gross margins for products are also influenced by the specific terms of our contracts  which may vary significantly from customer to customer based on the type of products sold  the overall size of the customer s order  and the architecture of the customer network  which can influence the amount and complexity of design  integration and installation services 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses consists of research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  restructuring charges  amortization of intangible assets  gain on sale of intangible assets and class action lawsuit charges 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of total operating expense 
on february   the audit committee of our board of directors authorized a restructuring plan pursuant to which employees were terminated 
for the three months ending march   we expect approximately million in charges for severance and related costs and million in additional facility costs  which will be recorded in our results of operations 
in  we expect overall operating expenses to decrease modestly compared to we decreased headcount in these functions to employees as of december  from employees as of december  research and development expense is the largest functional component of our operating expenses and consists primarily of personnel costs  independent contractor costs  prototype expenses  and other allocated facilities and information technology expense 
the majority of our research and development staff is focused on software development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
our development teams are located in tel aviv  israel  westborough  massachusetts  redwood city  california and shenzhen  peoples republic of 
table of contents china 
we expect our research and development expense to decrease modestly in absolute dollars in the near term due primarily to lower headcount 
sales and marketing expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions  promotional and other marketing expenses  travel  trade show expenses  and allocated facilities and information technology expense 
marketing programs are intended to generate net revenues from new and existing customers and are expensed as incurred 
we expect sales and marketing expense to decrease modestly in absolute dollars in the near term due primarily to lower headcount 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for general and administrative personnel  professional fees  and allocated facilities and information technology expenses 
professional services consist of outside legal  accounting and information technology and other consulting costs 
we expect that general and administrative expense will remain flat or increase modestly in absolute dollars as we continue to incur legal fees related to a lawsuit filed by us against imagine communications  inc alleging patent infringement 
we will also continue to incur costs related to being a public company  including the costs of financial reporting  sarbanes oxley act compliance and director and officer liability insurance 
in october  we sold certain intangible assets related to our fastflow provisioning software technology and realized a gain of million 
following the sale  we had no carrying value for intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  amortization of intangible assets was recorded straight line over the estimated lives of our patented products  customer relationships and trade names 
we incurred an expense of million in for the amount agreed to be paid by us to the lead plaintiff in preliminary settlement of our federal class action lawsuit 
this preliminary settlement is conditional on several things  including confirmatory discovery and approval of the courts of the proposed settlement  and includes contributions by our insurers 
the lawsuit was filed on october  and alleges that our ipo prospectus contained false and misleading statements regarding our business strategy and prospects  and the prospects of our cmts division in particular 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable periods 
management bases its estimates  assumptions  and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
our management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition our software and hardware are sold as solutions and our software is a significant component of the product 
we provide unspecified software updates and enhancements related to products through support contracts 
as a result  we account for revenues in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  for all transactions involving the sale of products with a significant software component 
revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred we have entered into an arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  customer payment is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 

table of contents product revenues consist of revenues from sales of our software and hardware 
product sales include a perpetual license to our software 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment to our customers  including channel partner distributors  on non cancellable contracts and purchase orders when all revenue recognition criteria are met  or  if specified in an agreement  upon receipt of final acceptance of the product  provided all other criteria are met 
end users  channel partners  and distributors generally have no rights of return  stock rotation rights  or price protection 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenues and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenues 
substantially all of our product sales have been made in combination with support services  which consist of software updates and support 
our customer service agreements csa allow customers to select from plans offering various levels of technical support  unspecified software upgrades and enhancements on an if and when available basis 
revenues for support services are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one year but can extend to five years for our telecommunications company customers 
revenues from other services  such as installation  program management and training  are recognized when services are performed 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when a customer agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenues 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occur or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element is customer support and there is no evidence of fair value for this support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately 
fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
in the event payment terms are greater than days  the fees are deemed not to be fixed or determinable and revenues are recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
deferred revenues consist primarily of deferred product revenues  net of the associated costs  and deferred service fees 
deferred product revenue generally relates to acceptance provisions that have not been met or partial shipment or when we do not have vsoe of fair value on the undelivered items 
when deferred revenues are recognized as revenues  the associated deferred costs are also recognized as cost of sales 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  all revenues are deferred from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
inventories  net inventories  net are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we provide for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales and usage  current economic trends  market conditions  product rationalization  forecasted sales  product lifecycle and current inventory levels 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded as cost of net product revenues 
this evaluation requires us to make estimates regarding future events in an industry where rapid technological changes are prevalent 
it is possible that increases in inventory write downs may be required in the future if there is a decline in market conditions or if changes in expected product lifecycles occur 
if market conditions improve or product lifecycles extend  we may have greater success in selling inventory that had previously been written down 
in either event  the actual value of our inventory may be higher or lower and recognition of such difference will affect our cost of net revenues in a future period  which could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
warranty liabilities we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship 
generally  we warrant our products for one year 
for our largest telecommunications company customer  we warrant our products for five years 
a 
table of contents provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is recorded as a component of cost of net product revenues when the product revenues are recognized based upon our historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
the recorded amount is adjusted from time to time for specifically identified warranty exposures 
where we have experienced higher product failure rates and costs of correcting product failures changed  or our estimates relating to specifically identified warranty exposures changed  we have recorded additional warranty reserves and may be required to do so in future periods 
if our estimated reserves differ from our actual warranty costs based on historical experience  we may reverse a portion of or increase such provisions in future periods 
in the event we change our warranty reserve estimates  the resulting charge against future cost of sales or reversal of previously recorded charges may materially affect our gross margins and operating results 
stock based compensation we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees  directors and to non employees under our equity incentive plan 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan at the lower of i of the fair market value on the first day of a six month offering period  or ii of the fair market value on the last date of the six month offering period 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the prospective transition method  which requires us to apply the provisions of sfas r to new awards granted  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled  after the effective date 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized beginning january  is based on a combination of the following a the grant date fair value of stock option awards and employee stock purchase plan shares granted or modified after january   and b the amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to stock option awards granted prior to january   which was calculated using the intrinsic value method as previously permitted under apb under sfas r  we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using a black scholes option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we use the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
options typically vest with respect to of the shares one year after the options vesting commencement date and the remainder ratably on a monthly basis over the following three years 
employee stock purchase plan shares vest over six months  and include two purchase dates per year 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
in valuing share based awards under sfas r  significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of our common stock and the expected term individuals will hold their share based awards prior to exercising 
expected volatility of the stock is based on our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and was calculated using the simplified method permitted by the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options  expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and ultimately the expense we record 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock based awards granted under sfas r to employees and directors were approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures 
these costs  adjusted for changes in estimated forfeiture rates from time to time  will be amortized over the next four years 
stock based compensation expense for awards granted to employees and directors for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
prior to january   we accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  and financial accounting standards board interpretation fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
 and had adopted the disclosure only provisions of 
table of contents sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure using the minimum value method 
in accordance with apb  stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  resulted from stock option grants at exercise prices that  for financial reporting purposes  were deemed to be below the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
during the years ended december   and  we amortized million  million  and million of deferred compensation expense  net of reversals  respectively 
as of december  we had no remaining balance that will be amortized in future periods  net of reversals 
we account for stock compensation arrangements with non employees in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
for stock options granted to non employees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using a black scholes valuation model 
in we granted  options and  restricted shares to non employees and recognized stock based compensation expense of million in associated with these awards 
we did not grant any awards to non employees for the years ended december  and allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable and provide allowances for the applicable portion of accounts receivable when collection becomes doubtful 
we provide allowances based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices  analysis of our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
on february   one of our customers announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with the holders of its senior debt notes  whereby the customer expects to file voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on or before april  as of december   our trade receivables included million from this customer  which was subsequently received in full 
all of these payments received from this customer were made to us were included in deferred revenues in accordance with the provisions of sop in our consolidated financial statements as of december  under the bankruptcy rules  an amount received by us within days of a formal bankruptcy filing by the customer may be subject to repayment if the payments are deemed to be preferential payments to us 
the million in collections from this customer consisted of numerous payments of open trade receivables  and we believe these payments were made in the normal course of business and are therefore not preferential payments 
accordingly  we have not included any receipts from this customer as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements as of december   as any potential repayments are not probable or estimable under the provisions of sfas impairment of long lived assets we assess impairment of long lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  or current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value  which is determined on a discounted cash flow basis 

table of contents we make estimates and judgments about future undiscounted cash flows and fair value 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a long lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
our estimates of anticipated future cash flows could be reduced significantly in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carry forwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions  losses  and credits can be utilized 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from us operations since  based on the available evidence  we believed at that time it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize all of these deferred tax assets in the future 
we intend to maintain the full valuation allowances against our us deferred tax assets until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
effective january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the emergency economic stabilization act of  the act  which contains the tax extenders and alternative minimum tax relief act of  was signed into law on october  under the act  the research credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after december  and before january  as a result of the us valuation allowance  there was no impact to our effective tax rate 
on september   california enacted assembly bill which among other provisions  suspends net operating loss deductions for and and extends the carryforward period of any net operating losses not utilized due to such suspension  adopts the federal year net operating loss carryforward period for losses attributable to and forward  phases in the federal two year net operating loss carryback periods beginning in and limits the utilization of tax credits to of a taxpayer s taxable income for and these changes materially impacted our effective tax rate

operating expenses research and development 
research and development expense was million for  or of net revenues compared to million for  or of net revenues 
the million increase was primarily due to an increase in bonus expense and depreciation expense 
these increases were slightly offset in part by decreased expenditures following our restructuring plans  which resulted in lower base salaries  travel  facility costs and lab and prototype expenditures

restructuring charges 
on october   the audit committee of our board of directors authorized a restructuring plan in connection with the retirement of our cmts platform along with an approximate company wide reduction in force 
this resulted in net charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
severance  comprised primarily of salary  payroll taxes and medical benefits  was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our plan also included vacating several leased facilities throughout the world  with lease terms expiring through march resulting in vacated facility charges  net of sublease income of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the costs associated with facility lease obligations are expected to be paid over the remaining term of the related obligations  which extends to march on april   the audit committee of our board of directors authorized an additional restructuring plan 
this resulted in net charges of million for the year ended december   including charges of million for vacated facility charges and million for severance costs 
the costs associated with facility lease obligations are expected to be paid over the remaining term of the related obligations  which extends to january in response to market and economic conditions  in february we reduced our operating expenses to increase our flexibility  while still attempting to not compromise short term revenue generating projects or our long term competitive position 
the reduction in force was undertaken to restructure and streamline our operations  provide more flexibility for ongoing operations and reduce operating costs 
the restructuring plan was authorized by the audit committee of our board of directors on february   pursuant to which employees were terminated 
we expect to record approximately million in charges for severance and related costs and million in additional facility costs in connection with this restructuring plan 
we expect to redeploy some of the anticipated savings from the restructuring plan to other programs and projects  and expect the net annualized cost savings to be approximately million  including million of stock based compensation as follows in thousands cost of net revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total estimated annualized savings gain on sale of intangible assets 
in october  consistent with our previously announced intent to focus on our video solutions  we sold certain intangible assets related to our fastflow provisioning software technology for consideration of million in cash and assumption of certain of our customer obligations 
class action lawsuit charges 
on january   the defendants reached an agreement in principle with the lead plaintiff to settle our main purported shareholder class action lawsuit pending in federal court 
the agreement provides a full release for all potential claims arising from the securities laws alleged in the initial and consolidated complaints  including claims for alleged violations of the securities act of and the exchange act of the agreement is  however  conditional on several things  including confirmatory discovery and approval of the court  and includes contributions by our insurers 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  we recorded an expense for million in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   which represented the amount we have agreed to pay 
interest income interest income was million for compared to million for while cash and cash equivalents increased for  interest income decreased due to lower interest rates for than 
table of contents interest expense we incurred no interest expense for and million for a portion of proceeds from our initial public offering was used to repay outstanding borrowings  which resulted in the elimination of interest expense for other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains losses and in a charge from fair value adjustments of preferred stock warrants 
other income expense  net for was an income of million  compared to an expense of million for in may  we reduced our forecasted cash flows in israeli new shekels and therefore reduced the notional value of our outstanding derivatives with maturity dates from june through december as a result of this change in forecasted cash flow  the derivative instruments were no longer deemed to be highly effective  resulting in the ineffective portion of the gain on these derivatives of million being recognized in other income expense  net in other income expense  net included a million charge from fair value adjustments of preferred stock warrants in upon the completion of our initial public offering on march   the warrants to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock became warrants to purchase our common stock and accordingly we ceased adjusting these warrants for changes in fair value and reclassified their respective liabilities to stockholders equity 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million and million for and  respectively  were related to provisions for both domestic and foreign income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
in connection with our adoption of sfas r  we use the with and without approach described in eitf topic no 
d  intraperiod tax allocation of the tax effect of pretax income from continuing operations to determine the recognition and measurement of excess tax benefits 
accordingly  we have elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid in capital 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation awards or other tax attributes  such as research and development credits and alternative minimum tax credits  in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the portion of the federal and state operating loss carryforwards  which related to stock option benefits  was approximately million

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private and public sales of equity and more recently from cash provided by operations 
we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as of december  cash flow operating activities the key line items affecting cash from operating activities were as follows in thousands years ended december  net income loss adjustments to reconcile net income loss to net cash provided by operating activities net income including adjustments decrease increase in trade receivables decrease in inventories  net decrease increase in deferred revenues decrease increase in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities other  net net cash provided by operating activities adjustments to reconcile net income loss to net cash provided by operating activities primarily included stock based compensation  depreciation of property and equipment and revaluation of preferred stock warrant liabilities 
net cash provided from operating activities increased in compared to primarily due to net income in compared to a net loss in this net cash provided from operating activities was offset in primarily due to decreased deferred revenues in compared to an increased in deferred revenues in net cash provided from operating activities decreased in compared to primarily due to decreased net income loss in compared to as well as lower cash generated by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million and million for and  respectively 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  the timing at which products are shipped during the quarter  accounts receivable collections  inventory and supply chain management as well as the timing of taxes and other accruals payments 
investing activities our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from net purchases of marketable securities of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million primarily to support our new product offerings

table of contents our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from net purchases of marketable securities of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million to support the business 
these capital expenditures consisted primarily of computer and test equipment and software purchases 
financing activities our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of options under our equity incentive plans and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from our ipo which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of million  proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of options under our equity incentive plans and sales under our employee stock purchase plans  and proceeds of million received from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock 
these increases were partially offset by the repayment of loans and capital leases of million 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from a net increase in borrowings of million  and proceeds of million received from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock  offset by million of costs to professional service providers associated with our ipo 
liquidity and capital resource requirements we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  the networking industry is capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in products and in research and development 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our product lines or research and development efforts  or for other strategic purposes such as significant acquisitions 
the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  changes in industry conditions  product mix  competitive factors and the timing of any strategic acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations  consist entirely of operating lease obligations  and as of december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than one year years years more than years total obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the securities and exchange commission s regulation s k 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  marketable securities and receivables  are not affected by inflation because they are short term and in the case of cash are immaterial 
our non monetary assets  consisting 
table of contents primarily of inventory  goodwill and prepaid expenses and other assets  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our cost of goods sold and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of our investment to fluctuate 
to control this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is not limited to our investment portfolio 
as of december   our investments were in commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  money market funds and us government and agency securities 
if overall interest rates fell for the year ended december   our interest income would have decreased by approximately million  assuming consistent investment levels 
foreign currency risk our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore the majority of our net revenues are not subject to foreign currency risk 
our operating expense and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the israeli new shekel  and to a lesser extent the chinese yuan and euro 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  during we established foreign currency risk management programs to hedge both balance sheet items and future forecasted expenses 
for the year ended december   the exchange rate fluctuation between the us dollar and the israeli new shekel increased our operating expenses by approximately million without hedging and million with hedging 
we also recognized a gain of million in related to hedging activities  which we recognized in other income expense  net 
an adverse change in exchange rates of for all foreign currencies  without any hedging  would have resulted in a decline of our income before taxes of approximately million for the year ended december  we continue to hedge our projected exposure of exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the israeli new shekel  and accordingly we do not anticipate that fluctuations will have a material impact on our financial results for the three months ending march  currency forward contracts and currency options are generally utilized in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs are intended to reduce  but not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
as our hedging program is relatively short term in nature  a long term material change in the value of the us dollar versus the israeli new shekel could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future
