company overview we have been purchasing and collecting defaulted or charged off accounts receivable portfolios from consumer credit originators since the formation of our predecessor company in charged off receivables are the unpaid obligations of individuals to credit originators  such as credit card issuers  consumer finance companies  healthcare providers  retail merchants  telecommunications and utility providers 
since these receivables are delinquent or past due  we are able to purchase them at a substantial discount 
we purchase and collect charged off consumer receivable portfolios for our own account as we believe this afford us the best opportunity to use long term strategies to maximize our profits 
market prices for charged off accounts receivable portfolios paper had steadily increased from through mid however  during the latter half of and continuing through  the market prices for comparable paper declined 
we believe macro economic factors caused by the recent financial crisis have resulted in a reduced expectation of consumers ability to repay their current and past due debts 
the lower expected liquidation of the paper by collection companies is the primary reason for the decline in market pricing 
macro economic factors include reduced availability of credit  falling real estate values  higher food and energy prices  increased unemployment and other factors macro economic factors 
in addition  we believe that some competitors ability to fund portfolio purchases has been reduced during the recent financial crisis 
finally  we believe that increases in charge off rates being experienced by major credit grantors is leading to an increase in supply of receivables available for sale 
reduced competition and increased supply may have also contributed to improved pricing 
during the twelve months ended december   we invested million net of buybacks in paper  with an aggregate face value of billion  or of face value 
in the twelve months ended december   we invested million net of buybacks through december  in paper  with an aggregate face amount of billion  or of face value 
our debt purchasing metrics dollars invested  face amount  average purchase price  types of paper and sources of paper may vary significantly from period to period 
the increase in blended rate was the result of the higher quality of paper we purchased during versus in  an increasing portion of our investment in purchased receivables was from forward flow contracts 
forward flow contracts commit a debt seller to sell a steady flow of paper to us  and commit us to purchase paper for a fixed percentage of the face value 
due to the macro economic factors  debt sellers and debt buyers alike believe that there will be continued downward pressure on the prices that are paid for paper 
however  we believe debt sellers are attempting to lock in pricing when possible through forward flow contracts 
for the twelve months ended december   we acquired million net of buybacks under forward flow contracts compared to million net of buybacks through december  during the twelve months ended december  forward flow contracts may be attractive to us because they provide operational advantages from the consistent amount and type of accounts acquired 
cash collections declined slightly in when compared to  despite continued investments in purchased receivables 
cash collections decreased by million or to million for the twelve 
table of contents months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  we believe that the reduction in cash collections is primarily a result of two factors 
first  a more difficult collection environment attributable to macro economic factors is leading to reduced liquidation of all vintages and types of paper 
we believe liquidation rates cash collections relative to face amount of paper declined throughout we expect this more difficult collections environment to continue and are adapting our collection tactics and operations to the current economic environment 
second  we believe our purchasing activity has outpaced our staffing of account representatives to collect on our inventory of paper  which may be leading to reduced collection results particularly on older vintages of paper 
we are addressing what we believe to be a capacity constraint on collections by forwarding more accounts to our agency network for collection on our behalf 
over the long term  we expect to increase our in house staffing to better align the number of account representatives with our inventory of paper 
net income for the twelve months ended december  was million  a decline of from million for the twelve months ended december  contributing to our decline in net income was higher amortization of purchased receivables including net impairment charges in determining purchased receivable revenues and increased interest expense that we incurred subsequent to the recapitalization transaction  which was funded in june purchased receivable revenues declined by million because of a combination of a million decrease in cash collections and increased purchased receivable amortization of million in when compared to amortization of purchased receivables  the difference between cash collections and purchased receivable revenues  increased to of cash collections for the twelve months ended december  versus for the twelve months ended december  included in amortization of purchased receivables were net impairments of million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the increased purchased receivables amortization rate was primarily a result of lower multiples of purchase price expected to be collected in addition to placing the first quarter of aggregate and all healthcare portfolios on the cost recovery method 
as prices for paper rose through mid  our expected collection multiple of purchase price was reduced from prior levels 
macro economic factors negatively affecting consumers are also a factor in the lower multiples of purchase price expected to be collected  even as pricing for paper falls 
the lower multiple of purchase price expected to be collected generally results in a lower yield to be assigned for revenue recognition purposes 
when lower yields are assigned  a larger proportion of our cash collections are treated as purchased receivable amortization instead of purchased receivable revenues 
impairments are generated when currently assigned yields are too high in relation to collection expectations which may have declined because of macro economic factors affecting the consumers ability to repay their obligations or for other reasons 
average borrowings on our credit facilities were million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increased average borrowings are primarily the result of million borrowed on our term loan  which was outstanding for all of versus approximately seven months in the term loan was initially funded in june additionally  we have borrowed to fund our purchase of paper since late as a result of these two factors  interest expense increased by million to million in the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the twelve months ended december  we reduced our operating expenses both in absolute dollars and in relation to cash collections in versus total operating expenses were million for the twelve months ended december   a decrease of million from million in the twelve months ended december  as a percentage of cash collections  operating expenses were and for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of the decrease in operating expense was a result of reductions in collections expense  occupancy expense and restructuring charges of million  million and million  respectively  as compared to december  our collections from third party relationships attorneys and collection agencies increased to of total cash collections for the twelve months ended december  from for the twelve months ended december  total forwarding fees paid on cash collections from these third party relationships increased to million in the twelve months ended december  
table of contents from million in the twelve months ended december  the remaining expenses included in collections expense declined by million in the twelve months ended december  and primarily reflected reduced legal collection costs 
the reduction in legal collection costs included a million savings in court costs associated with our legal forwarding collections as a result of a new third party relationship that allows us to better match these costs with the associated collections 
the savings were partially offset by an increased contingency rate under this relationship  which resulted in an increase in forwarding fees paid of million 
the remaining savings were realized from a combination of reduced spending on in house collection efforts  lower data provider costs and better expense management 
occupancy expenses declined by million in the twelve months ended december  versus the twelve months ended december  resulting primarily from the consolidation of two call centers during there were no restructuring charges in we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
as of january  as it applies to financial assets and liabilities 
adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of financial position  operations or cash flows 
according to financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
fas  the application of sfas to certain non financial assets and liabilities  including goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  was deferred to fiscal years beginning after november  our goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment on a recurring basis and the deferral of sfas applies to these items 
we have chosen not to adopt sfas no

industry overview the accounts receivable management industry is driven by a number of industry and economic trends  including increasing levels of consumer debt obligations according to the us federal reserve board  the consumer credit industry increased from billion of consumer debt obligations in to trillion of consumer debt obligations in december  a compound annual growth rate of 
according to the us federal reserve board  the amount of outstanding revolving and non revolving consumer credit has increased at a compound annual growth rate of from trillion in december to trillion in december decreasing pricing environment according to the kaulkin ginsberg report for the third quarter of  beginning in the third quarter of  pricing began to moderate from the elevated pricing levels exhibited in the debt purchasing markets in recent years 
we believe that pricing has continued to moderate throughout according to the kaulkin ginsberg index for the fourth quarter of  the charge off rate increased in the fourth quarter of  indicating a favorable supply environment for debt purchasers 
impact of macro economic factors macro economic factors also affect consumer s ability to satisfy outstanding debt 
during  financial markets began to experience extreme disruption 
the residential real estate market in the united states has experienced a significant downturn due to declining real estate values  substantially reducing mortgage loan originations and securitizations and precipitating a significant contraction in liquidity and credit available to consumers 
the unemployment rate and the number of individual bankruptcy filings have also increased in recent months  leaving individual consumers with less resources available to satisfy their debt and indicating a more challenging collection environment 
historically  credit originators have sought to limit credit losses either through using internal collection efforts with their own associates or outsourcing collection activities to third party collectors 
credit originators that outsource the collection of charged off receivables have typically remained committed to third party providers as a result of the perceived economic benefit of outsourcing and the resources required to establish the infrastructure required to support in house collection efforts 
the credit originator can pursue an outsourced 
table of contents solution by either selling its charged off receivables for immediate cash proceeds or by placing charged off receivables with a third party collector on a contingent fee basis while retaining ownership of the receivables 
in the event that a credit originator sells receivables to a debt purchaser such as us  the credit originator receives immediate cash proceeds and eliminates the costs and risks associated with internal recovery operations 
the purchase price for these charged off receivables are generally discounted more than from their face values  depending on the amount the purchaser anticipates it can recover and the anticipated effort required to recover that amount 
credit originators  as well as other holders of consumer debt  utilize a variety of processes to sell receivables  including the following competitive bids for specified portfolios through a sealed bid or  in some cases  an on line process  privately negotiated transactions between the credit originator or other holder of consumer debt and a purchaser  and forward flow contracts  which commit a debt seller to sell  and a purchaser to acquire  a steady flow of charged off consumer receivables periodically over a specified period of time  usually no less than three months  for a fixed percentage of the face value of the receivables 
we have seen prices for charged off accounts receivable portfolios steadily decline since the second half of deteriorating economic conditions  increasing unemployment rates  increasing charged off volumes  and a decreased access to credit in the market are some of the reasons for the decline in pricing 
we have seen bank consolidation  an increased desire by sellers of debt to enter into forward flows and a decrease in competition over the course of the past year 
we believe a debt purchaser s ability to successfully collect payments on charged off receivables  despite previous collection efforts by the credit originator or third party collection agencies  is driven by several factors  including the purchaser s ability to pursue collections over multi year periods  tailor repayment plans based on a consumer s ability to pay  and utilize experience and resources  including litigation 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues and as a percentage of cash collections for the periods indicated 
percent of total revenues percent of cash collections years ended december  years ended december  revenues purchased receivable revenues gain on sale of purchased receivables other revenues total revenues expenses salaries and benefits collections expense occupancy administrative restructuring charges depreciation and amortization impairment of assets loss on disposal of equipment total operating expense income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other income before income taxes income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from total revenues of million for the year ended december  purchased receivable revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december  amount of million 
purchased receivable revenues reflect an amortization rate  or the difference between cash collections and revenue  of for the year ended december   an increase of percentage points  from the amortization rate of for the year ended december  the increased amortization rate is primarily due to lower average internal rates of return assigned to recent years purchases as well as placing the first quarter of aggregate and all healthcare portfolios on the cost recovery method 
purchased receivable revenues reflect net impairments recognized during the year ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
cash collections on charged off consumer receivables decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in cash collections for the year ended december  and include collections from fully amortized portfolios of million and million  respectively  of which were reported as revenue 
during the year ended december   we acquired charged off consumer receivable portfolios with an aggregate face value of billion at a cost of million  or of face value  net of buybacks 
included 
table of contents in these purchase totals were portfolios with an aggregate face value of billion at a cost of million  or of face value  which were acquired through forward flow contracts 
revenues on portfolios purchased from our top three sellers during vintage years through were million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
the top three sellers were the same in both of the twelve month periods 
during the year ended december   we acquired charged off consumer receivable portfolios with an aggregate face value of billion at a cost of million  or of face value adjusted for buybacks through december  
included in these purchase totals were portfolios with an aggregate face value of million at a cost of million  or of face value adjusted for buybacks through december   which were acquired through nine forward flow contracts 
from period to period  we may buy charged off receivables of varying age  types and cost 
as a result  the cost of our purchases  as a percent of face value  may fluctuate from one period to the next 
we believe the increase in the blended rate we paid in of versus the blended rate paid in of was the result of purchasing higher quality portfolios of charged off receivables in the current year 
the higher blended rate paid in relative to did not reflect overall market prices  which were lower in than in for comparable portfolios 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to total operating expenses of million for the year ended december  total operating expenses were of cash collections for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in the majority of the decrease in operating expense is a result of reductions in collections expense  occupancy expense and restructuring charges of million  million and million  respectively  as compared to december  operating expenses are traditionally measured in relation to revenues 
however  we measure operating expenses in relation to cash collections 
we believe this is appropriate because of varying amortization rates  which is the difference between cash collections and revenues recognized  from period to period  due to the seasonality of collections and other factors that can distort the analysis of operating expenses when measured against revenues 
additionally  we believe that the majority of our operating expenses are variable in relation to cash collections 
salaries and benefits 
salaries and benefits expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to salaries and benefits expense of million for the year ended december  salaries and benefits expense decreased primarily because of a million decrease in compensation expense other than share based compensation expense and a million decrease in other associate related expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in share based compensation expense 
however  the decrease in cash collections was more than the decrease in salaries and benefits expense resulting in salaries and benefits expense of of cash collections for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in before  we had granted share based compensation to our non associate directors and occasionally to certain key associates  generally for recruiting or retention reasons 
during  we began a program to issue periodic share based awards to a broader group of key management associates including our executive officers 
a portion of the share based compensation grants to executive officers included the use of performance conditions for vesting 
in  we recognized million of compensation expense in salaries and benefits expense  which included a reversal of million for performance based awards for executive officers not expected to vest 
we did not make an annual grant of share based compensation awards during in  we recognized million of compensation expense in salaries and benefits expense  which included a reversal of million for a performance based award  related to the acquisition of parc in  not expected to vest 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested awards of which million was expected to vest over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents collections expense 
collections expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to collections expense of million for the year ended december  collections expense was of cash collections during the year ended december  compared with for the same period in collections expense decreased primarily due to a million decline in variable costs associated with reduced spending on in house collection efforts  lower data provider costs and better expense management 
in addition  the reduction of variable expense included a million savings in court costs associated with our legal forwarding collections as a result of a new third party relationship that allows us to better match these costs with the associated collections 
the savings were partially offset by an increased contingency rate under this relationship which resulted in an increase in forwarding fees paid of million

the notional amount of the swap was million until september when the notional amount declined to million of the outstanding balance on our term loan 
this interest rate swap is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge and the effective portion of the gain or loss on such hedge is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements

historical collections purchase period purchase price year ended december  dollars in thousands pre total cumulative collections purchase period purchase price total through december  dollars in thousands cumulative collections as percentage of purchase price purchase period purchase price total through december  does not include proceeds from sales of any receivables 
includes million of portfolios acquired from the acquisition of parc on april  purchase price refers to the cash paid to a seller to acquire a portfolio less buybacks less the purchase price for accounts that were sold at the time of purchase to another debt purchaser 

table of contents seasonality the success of our business depends on our ability to collect on our purchased portfolios of charged off consumer receivables 
collections within portfolios tend to be seasonally higher in the first and second quarters of the year due to consumers receipt of tax refunds and other factors 
conversely  collections within portfolios tend to be lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to consumers spending in connection with summer vacations  the holiday season and other factors 
however  revenue recognized is relatively level  excluding the impact of impairments  due to the application of the provisions prescribed by sop in addition  our operating results may be affected to a lesser extent by the timing of purchases of charged off consumer receivables due to the initial costs associated with purchasing and integrating these receivables into our system 
consequently  income and margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
below is a table that illustrates our quarterly cash collections from january  through december  cash collections quarter first second third fourth total cash collections below is a table that illustrates the percentages by source of our total cash collections for the year ended december  traditional collections legal collections other collections total cash collections certain cash collections have been reclassified to make the through disclosures comparable to the disclosures 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of cash have been from operations and bank borrowings 
we have traditionally used cash for acquisitions of purchased receivables  repayment of bank borrowings  purchasing property and equipment and working capital to support growth 
during  we had repayments of million to reduce our outstanding borrowing balances while having million in new borrowings 
in addition  we entered into a new agreement with a third party collecting on our behalf 
under this agreement  we will receive a total cash advance of million through november we received million through december  and incurred million in court cost expenses  which were offset against the cash advance 
an asset of million for the court costs incurred in excess of the cash advance received is included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial position 

table of contents borrowings we maintain a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders named therein  that originated on june  and was amended on march  the amended new credit agreement 
under the terms of the amended new credit agreement  we have a five year million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility and a six year million term loan facility the term loan facility and together with the revolving credit facility  the amended new credit facilities 
the amended new credit facilities bear interest at prime or up to basis points over prime depending upon our liquidity  as defined in the amended new credit agreement 
alternately  at our discretion  we may borrow by entering into one  two  three  six or twelve month libor contracts at rates between to basis points over the respective libor rates  depending on our liquidity 
our revolving credit facility includes an accordion loan feature that allows us to request a million increase as well as sublimits for million of letters of credit and for million of swingline loans 
the amended new credit agreement is secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets 
the amended new credit agreement also contains certain covenants and restrictions that we must comply with  which as of december  were leverage ratio as defined cannot exceed i to at any time on or before june   ii to at any time on or after june  and on or before december  or iii to at any time thereafter  ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated tangible net worth cannot exceed i to at any time on or before december   ii to at any time on or after december  and on or before december   iii to at any time on or after december  and on or before december  or iv to to any time thereafter  and consolidated tangible net worth must equal or exceed million plus of positive consolidated net income for three consecutive fiscal quarters ending december  and for each fiscal year ending thereafter  such amount to be added as of december  and as of the end of each such fiscal year thereafter 
the amended new credit agreement contains a provision that requires us to repay excess cash flow  as defined  to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our amended new credit agreement 
the annual repayment of our excess cash flow is first effective with the issuance of our audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year and is generally due within days of the issuance of the annual financial statements 
the repayment provisions are of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was less than or equal to to but greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  or if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to to as of the end of such fiscal year 
commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility are paid quarterly  in arrears  and are calculated as an amount equal to a margin of to  depending on our liquidity  on the average amount available on the revolving credit facility 
the amended new credit agreement requires us to effectively cap  collar or exchange interest rates on a notional amount of at least of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan facility 
we have an interest rate swap agreement that hedges a portion of the interest rate expense on the term loan facility 
we had million principal balance outstanding on our amended new credit facilities at december  we have a required prepayment  under the excess cash flow provision of the amended new credit agreement  of million of principal on our term loan facility for this prepayment is related to the excess cash flow for the twelve months ended december  we believe we are in compliance with all terms of the amended new credit agreement as of december  
table of contents cash flows the majority of our purchases have been funded with borrowings against our revolving credit facility and with internal cash flow 
for the year ended december   we invested million in purchased receivables  net of buybacks  while having a net repayment of million on our amended new credit facilities 
the net repayment on our amended new credit facilities included million of repayments partially offset by million of borrowings against our revolving credit facility 
our cash balance has decreased from million at december  to million as of december  our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and were generated primarily from net income earned through cash collections as adjusted for the timing of payments in income taxes  accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of december   and  respectively  compared to the previous year 
investing activities used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used for investing purposes was primarily due to acquisitions of purchased receivables  net of cash collections applied to principal  which is net of buybacks for all vintage years 
in addition  we acquired million in property and equipment  primarily software and computer equipment related to the new collection platform during in we used million to acquire parc  net of cash acquired 
financing activities used cash of million for the year ended december  financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  and used cash of million for the year ended december  cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to repayments on our revolving credit facility and term loan facility of million net of borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million 
in addition  cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  was due to payment of deferred financing costs of million associated with the amended new credit agreement 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to borrowings of million under our amended new credit facilities and former credit agreement to fund the recapitalization transactions and investments in purchased receivables 
the cash provided by financing activities in was partially offset by million repayment on our former credit agreement  amended new credit facilities and capital lease obligations as well as payments of million for our repurchase of million shares in accordance with the recapitalization plan 
furthermore  our board of directors declared a special one time cash dividend of per share  or million in aggregate  which was paid on july  to holders of record on july  also in  we exercised our right to buy shares from our former associates for per share  or million 
cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to the million repurchase of million shares in accordance with a stock repurchase program  as well as the million repayment of parc s loan balances on the date of acquisition 
cash provided by financing activities in was due to million of borrowings against our former credit agreement to fund the investment in purchased receivables 
we believe that cash generated from operations combined with borrowing available under our amended new credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
in the future  if we need additional capital for investment in purchased receivables  working capital or to grow our business or acquire other businesses  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or we may seek to increase the availability under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents future contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  year ending december  thereafter operating lease obligations purchase commitment purchased receivables revolving credit term loan contractual interest on derivative instruments total in  we signed an agreement with a software provider and initiated a project to install a new collection platform 
we have a contractual commitment to purchase million in additional software 
in addition  we expect to spend approximately million over the next year to fully implement this software 
costs will be capitalized in accordance with the guidance in sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this project is funded with cash from operations and borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
we have six forward flow contracts that have terms beyond december  with the last contract expiring in december in addition to the six forward flow contracts  we have two on going forward flow contracts that have estimated monthly purchases of approximately to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our revolving credit facility  it would be due in june or earlier as defined in the amended new credit agreement 
interest on our revolving credit facility is variable and is not included within the amount outstanding as of december  to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our term loan facility  it would be due in june the variable interest is not included within the amount outstanding as of december  in addition  we are required to prepay million of principal on our term loan facility in the first quarter of this prepayment is related to the excess cash flow for the twelve months ended december   as defined in our amended new credit amendment 
we have recorded a liability of million relating to uncertain tax positions  which has been excluded from the table above because the amount and fiscal year of the payment cannot be reliably estimated 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we utilize the interest method of accounting for our purchased receivables because we believe that the amounts and timing of cash collections for our purchased receivables can be reasonably estimated 
this belief is predicated on our historical results and our knowledge of the industry 
the interest method is prescribed by sop we adopted the provisions of sop in january and apply sop to purchased receivables acquired after december  the provisions of sop that relate to decreases in expected cash flows amend previously followed guidance  pb  for consistent treatment and apply prospectively to purchased receivables acquired before january  we purchase pools of homogenous accounts receivable and record 
table of contents each pool at its acquisition cost 
pools purchased after may be aggregated into one or more static pools within each quarter  based on common risk characteristics 
risk characteristics of purchased receivables are assumed to be similar since purchased receivables are usually in the late stages of the post charged off collection cycle 
we therefore aggregate most pools purchased within each quarter 
pools purchased before may not be aggregated with other pool purchases 
each static pool  either aggregated or non aggregated  retains its own identity and does not change over the remainder of its life 
each static pool is accounted for as a single unit for recognition of revenue  principal payments and impairments 
each static pool of receivables is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows based on historical cash collections for pools with similar characteristics 
an internal rate of return irr is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on the projected cash flows 
the irr is applied to the remaining balance of each static pool of accounts to determine the revenue recognized 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess the actual performance compared to the expected performance 
to the extent there are differences in actual performance versus expected performance  the irr is adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
effective january  under sop  if the revised cash flow estimates are less than the original estimates  the irr remains unchanged and an impairment is recognized 
if cash flow estimates increase subsequent to recording an impairment  reversal of the previously recognized impairment is made prior to any increases to the irr 
the cost recovery method prescribed by sop is used when collections on a particular portfolio cannot be reasonably predicted 
under the cost recovery method  no revenue is recognized until we have fully collected the cost of the portfolio 
application of the interest method of accounting requires the use of estimates  primarily estimated remaining collections  to calculate a projected irr for each pool 
these estimates are primarily based on historical cash collections 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than the remaining collections estimate  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected will have a favorable impact on yields and revenues 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected will have an unfavorable impact and may result in an impairment being recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization we periodically review the carrying value of intangible assets not subject to amortization  including goodwill  to determine whether impairment may exist 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets not subject to amortization be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value  goodwill is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the book value of that goodwill 
if the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the estimate of fair value of our reporting unit  our purchased receivables operating segment is determined using various valuation techniques including market capitalization and an analysis of discounted cash flows 
at 
table of contents the time of the annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of  market capitalization was substantially higher than book value and goodwill was considered not to be impaired 
given recent declines in our stock price  we also performed a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
we base assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates on our budget and long term plans 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the reporting unit 
the fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis also exceeded the book value as of december   therefore  we did not recognize an impairment of goodwill 
the annual impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization  for example  trademark and trade names  consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using various discounted cash flow valuation methodologies 
significant assumptions are inherent in this process  including estimates of discount rates 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets 
we performed a discounted cash flow analysis of our trademark and trade names as of december  and determined that no impairment charges were required 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  a valuation allowance would be established and charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to the interest rate risk with our amended new credit facilities 
we may periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate exposure associated with our outstanding debt 
the outstanding borrowings on our amended new credit facilities were million  and million as of december   and  respectively 
in september  we entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement whereby  on a quarterly basis  we swap variable rates equal to three month libor for fixed rates on the notional amount of million 
every year thereafter  on the anniversary of the swap agreement the notional amount will decrease by million 
the hedged borrowings on our amended new credit facilities were million at december  the outstanding unhedged borrowings on our amended new credit facilities were million as of december   consisting of million outstanding on the revolving credit facility and million outstanding on the term loan facility 
interest rates on unhedged borrowings may be based on the prime rate or libor  at our discretion 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates  interest expense would have increased approximately million  million and less than million on the unhedged borrowings for the year ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the swap was determined to be highly effective in hedging against fluctuations in variable interest rates associated with the underlying debt 
interest rates have decreased since we 
table of contents entered into our swap agreement  reducing the fair value and resulting in a liability balance 
additional declines in interest rates will further reduce the fair value  while increasing interest rates will increase the fair value 
interest rate fluctuations do not have a material impact on interest income
