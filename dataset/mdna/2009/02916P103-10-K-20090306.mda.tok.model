item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements  including as a result of the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
see special note regarding forward looking statements appearing at the beginning of this report and risk factors set forth in item a of this report 
overview we are a leading north american designer and manufacturer of hopper and tank railcars 
we also repair and refurbish railcars  provide fleet management services and design and manufacture certain railcar and industrial components 
we provide our railcar customers with integrated solutions through a comprehensive set of high quality products and related services 
we operate in two segments manufacturing operations and railcar services 
manufacturing operations consist of railcar manufacturing as well as railcar and industrial component manufacturing 
railcar services consist of railcar repair and refurbishment services and fleet management services 
during  we experienced favorable labor efficiencies and overhead cost control at most of our locations including our tank railcar manufacturing complex that includes our flexible railcar manufacturing plant 
the additional manufacturing capacity provided by this new flexible plant along with the manufacturing agreement with acf led to increased tank railcar shipments for us in compared to acf is an affiliate of mr 
carl icahn  our principal beneficial stockholder and the chairman of our board of directors 
our railcar services group performed well in due to a favorable mix of work 
the recent worldwide financial turmoil and associated economic downturn has adversely affected sales of our railcars and other products and caused us to slow our production rates 
we believe restricted credit markets may be making it more costly for purchasers of railcars to obtain financing on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  the slow down of the united states economy has reduced and may continue to reduce requirements for the transport of products carried by the railcars we manufacture 
these factors have resulted in and may continue to result in decreased demand and increased pricing pressures on the sales of railcars and railcar components 
sales of other of our industrial products have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the slow down in industrial output  as well 

table of contents given the economic downturn  the railcar industry has weakened and we expect industry railcar shipments to decline in from we also expect our shipments and revenues to decrease in from factors affecting operating results the following is a discussion of some of the key factors that have in the past and could in the future to affect our operating results 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the cyclical nature of the north american railcar market  our reliance on a few customers for most of our revenues  our experience with customer order frequency and size  revenues from our affiliates representing a significant portion of our revenue and fluctuation in supplies and prices of raw materials and components used in railcar manufacturing 
see risk factors for a more comprehensive list of factors that could affect our operating results 
cyclicality of the railcar industry and effect of economic conditions historically  the north american railcar market has been and we expect it to continue to be highly cyclical 
for example  we have experienced a decrease in demand and an increase in pricing pressures in the tank and hopper railcar markets as well as downturns and decreased demand in all of the railcar manufacturing industry 
in addition  there has been a global economic downturn  which has resulted and may continue to result in lower sales volumes  lower prices for railcars and a loss of profits for us  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to convert our railcar backlog into revenues 
customer concentration railcars are typically sold pursuant to large  periodic orders  and a limited number of customers typically represent a significant percentage of our railcar sales in any given year 
the loss of any significant portion of our sales to any major customer  the loss of a single major customer or a material adverse change in the financial condition of any one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
as of december   we fully reserved for all outstanding invoices due to us from one railcar services customer that filed bankruptcy on january   totaling million 
we continue to provide services to this customer with shortened payment terms 
this customer represented of total consolidated revenues for each of the years ended december   and customer order size and frequency many of our customers place orders for railcars on an as needed basis  sometimes only once every few years 
as a result  the order levels for railcars  the mix of railcar types ordered and the railcars ordered by any particular customer have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future 
as railcar sales comprised  and  respectively  of our total consolidated revenues in  and  our results of operations in any particular period may be significantly affected by the number of railcars and the product mix of railcars we deliver in that period 
revenues from affiliates in  and  our revenues from affiliates accounted for  and of our total consolidated revenues  respectively 
these affiliates consisted of entities beneficially owned and controlled by mr 
carl c 
icahn  the chairman of our board of directors and our principal controlling stockholder 
we believe that revenues from affiliates will continue to constitute an important portion of our business 
a significant reduction in sales to affiliates could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

table of contents raw material costs the price for steel  the primary raw material used in the manufacture of our railcars  has in the past and may in the future vary as a result of worldwide demand  limited availability of production inputs for steel  including scrap metal  industry consolidation and import trade barriers 
these factors could also cause a corresponding increase or decrease in the cost and availability of castings and other railcar components constructed with steel 
costs for other railcar manufacturers could be similarly affected by the availability and pricing of steel and castings and other components 
component supply constraints our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty components  such as railcar wheels  brakes  sideframes  axles  bearings  yokes  bolsters and other heavy castings as well as specialized raw materials  such as normalized steel plates used in the production of railcars 
if our suppliers of railcar components and raw materials were to stop or reduce their production  go out of business  refuse to continue their business relationships with us  reduce the amounts they are willing to sell to us or become subject to work stoppages  our business would be disrupted 
this could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to continue or increase our railcar production depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of these railcar components and raw materials 
results of operations the following table summarizes our historical operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods shown 
our historical results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that may be expected in the future 
years ended december  revenues manufacturing operations railcar services total revenues cost of revenue manufacturing operations railcar services total cost of revenue gross profit income related to insurance recoveries  net gain on asset conversion  net selling  administrative and other expenses earnings from operations interest income interest expense other income income loss from joint venture earnings before income tax expense income tax expense net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our revenues in increased to million from million in this increase was attributable to an increase in revenues from both manufacturing operations and railcar services 

table of contents our manufacturing operations revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was partially attributable to the delivery of more railcars in compared to the increase in shipments reflects the completion of our marmaduke expansion efforts and additional tank railcars shipped under our acf manufacturing contract  partially offset by the decline in hopper railcar shipments in  due to less demand and increased competition for hopper railcar products 
manufacturing operations revenues also increased due to higher selling prices on most railcars caused by increases in raw materials prices that we were able to pass on to most of our customers 
during  we shipped  railcars compared to  railcars in for the year ended december   we recognized revenue of million related to railcars that were manufactured under the acf manufacturing agreement 
this agreement will terminate on the later of the completion of  tank railcars or march  in  our manufacturing operations revenues included million  or of our total consolidated revenues  from transactions with affiliates  compared to million  or of our total consolidated revenues  in these revenues were attributable to sales of railcars and railcar parts to companies controlled by mr

since arl split from ari in  arl has and continues to reduce these services 
this reduction has not affected the repair and maintenance services that ari provides to arl 
the company does not anticipate this reduction to have a material impact on its railcar services revenue 
gross profit our gross profit decreased to million in from million in our gross profit margin decreased to in from in the decrease in overall gross profit margin was primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit margins in our manufacturing operations 
our gross profit margin for our manufacturing operations decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower margins on hopper railcars as a result of competitive market conditions and increased material costs and surcharges on some hopper railcars that we could not recover through higher selling prices on fixed price contracts 
the increased material costs and surcharges that we were able to recover through increased selling prices on most railcars had a negative effect on gross profit margin  because we did not realize additional profit from these recoveries 
partially offsetting these costs were higher tank railcar shipments in along with favorable labor efficiencies and overhead cost control at our manufacturing facilities 
our gross profit margin for railcar services increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to labor efficiencies  increased capacity and a favorable mix of work 
selling  administrative and other expenses our selling  administrative and other expenses decreased by million in to million from million in these selling  administrative and other expenses  which include stock based compensation  were of total consolidated revenues in as compared to of total consolidated revenues in the decrease of million was primarily attributable to a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million resulting from decreased stock appreciation rights sars expense driven by our lower stock price levels in  which negatively affected the fair value of the sars 
in addition  income was recognized in from the reversal of expense for forfeited stock options 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense was partially offset by an increase in various other expenses in amounting to million mainly driven by increases in travel and other costs related to our recently formed joint venture and depreciation expense related to recently completed projects 

table of contents interest expense and interest income net interest expense for was million  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense  as compared to million of net interest expense for  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense 
the million increase in interest expense from to was due to interest expense on our unsecured senior notes which had an additional two months of interest costs in compared to the million decrease in interest income from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest rates and a decrease in average cash balances held in compared to due to cash invested in available for sale securities 
cash invested in generated a greater return than in other income during  we purchased shares of the greenbrier companies gbx common stock and subsequently sold a portion of that investment resulting in a realized gain of million 
we also entered into total return swap agreements referencing  shares of gbx common stock 
during july and august of  all of these total return swap agreements were settled for a realized gain of million 
we also experienced gains on an option to purchase canadian dollars which resulted in million unrealized gain and million realized gain at december  income from joint ventures income from joint ventures decreased from million in to million in due to fluctuations in ohio castings and axis net income loss 
axis reported a net loss in  of which our share was million and ohio castings reported net income  of which our share was million

our manufacturing operations revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was partially attributable to the delivery of more railcars in compared to  when shipments were reduced due to the shutdown from the tornado damage to the marmaduke facility 
the increase in shipments reflects the restart of our marmaduke operations  the expansion of our marmaduke complex and additional tank railcars shipped under our acf manufacturing contract  partially offset by the decline in hopper railcar shipments ordered for delivery in  due to less demand and increased competition for hopper railcar products during that period 
during  we shipped  railcars compared to  railcars in in the year ended december   we recognized revenue of million related to railcars that were manufactured under the acf manufacturing agreement

our gross profit margin for railcar services decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributable to mix of work content at our repair plants and higher costs for various railcar services in income related to insurance recoveries  net and gain on asset conversion  net on april   our marmaduke  arkansas tank railcar manufacturing complex was damaged by a tornado 
we were covered by property insurance covering wind and rain damage to our property  incremental costs and operating expenses we incurred due to the tornado damage at our marmaduke complex 
in addition  we were covered by insurance for business interruption as a direct result of the insured damage 
our deductibles on these policies are million for property insurance and a five day equivalent time element business interruption deductible  which resulted in million 
the final property damage claim settlement amounted to million  prior to application of the deductible  and the final business interruption insurance settlement amounted to million  prior to application of the deductible

the charge for these asset write offs was netted against the net insurance settlement of million related to the property damage insurance claim to arrive at the gain on asset conversion  net 
other costs amounting to million were incurred related to clean up costs and various miscellaneous repairs associated with the storm damage 

table of contents the tornado related insurance settlement for the property damage claim includes million in cash proceeds received during to provide funds to clean up and repair the plant in marmaduke as well as order replacement assets so the plant was operational in a timely manner

the terms of this facility contain restrictive covenants on  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  modify our current governing documents  sell or dispose of collateral  grant credit and declare or pay dividends or make distributions on common stock or other equity securities 
this facility is described in further detail in note of our consolidated financial statements  and provides for relief from certain financial covenants described in that note so long as we maintain excess availability of at least million 
as of december   and for the year then ended  we were in compliance with these covenants 

table of contents at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility and million of availability based upon the amount of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory without regard to any financial covenants 
if we were able to maintain excess availability of at least million  our availability would be million 
we currently intend to obtain a new credit facility effective upon the current agreement s expiration in october we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such a facility or other new financing on favorable terms  if at all 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors  including fluctuations in business volume  contract terms for billings and collections  the timing of collections on our accounts receivables  processing of payroll and associated taxes and payments to our suppliers 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
net earnings of million were impacted by the non cash items including but not limited to depreciation and amortization expense of million  joint venture earnings of million  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve of million and other smaller adjustments 
cash provided by operating activities attributable to changes in our current assets and liabilities included an increase in accrued expenses and taxes of million 
cash used in operating activities included an increase in inventory of million  a decrease of million in accounts payable including those to affiliates and a decrease in other of million 
the increase in accrued expenses and taxes was primarily due to increased accrued taxes at december  compared to december  the increase in inventories was primarily due to increased material prices at december  compared to december  the decrease in accounts payable is primarily due to production slowdowns and the timing of payments for the period ending december  compared to the period ending december  cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  this amount includes million of purchases of property  plant and equipment  a million contribution to our axis joint venture  a million cash inflow from the sale of a portion of our interest in our axis joint venture and net cash outflow of million from our investment activity in the common stock of gbx 
the capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of equipment at multiple locations to increase capacity and operating efficiencies 
some of these purchases are described in further detail below under capital expenditures 
the cash outflow related to our investment in the common stock of gbx resulted from our january purchase of  shares of gbx common stock for million and our subsequent sale of  of these shares during the second and third quarters of for proceeds of million 
in addition to purchasing shares of gbx common stock  we also entered into total return swap agreements that referenced  shares of common stock of greenbrier in january the total notional amount of these swap agreements was approximately million  which represented the fair market value of the referenced shares at the time we entered into the agreements 
during july and august  all of the company s total return swap agreements were settled in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
the settlement of the total return swap agreements resulted in a realized gain of million 
from time to time  we may invest in marketable securities  or derivatives thereof  including higher risk equity securities and high yield debt instruments 
these securities are subject to general credit  liquidity  market risks and interest rate fluctuations that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused overall tightening of the credit markets and the decline in the stock markets 
the market risks associated with any investments we may make may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 

table of contents our investments at any given time also may become highly concentrated within a particular company  industry  asset category  trading style or financial or economic market 
in that event  our investment portfolio will be more susceptible to fluctuations in value resulting from adverse economic conditions affecting the performance of that particular company  industry  asset category  trading style or economic market than a less concentrated portfolio would be 
as a result  our investment portfolio could become concentrated and its aggregate return may be volatile and may be affected substantially by the performance of only one or a few holdings 
as of december   we had million of short term investments 
in addition  during january and february  we paid million to invest in corporate bonds that mature in with interest payments semi annually 
if the note issuer is unable to repay these notes  it could materially adversely affect our financial results and future liquidity 
capital expenditures we continuously evaluate facility requirements based on our strategic plans  production requirements and market demand and may elect to change our level of capital investments in the future 
these investments are all based on an analysis of the rates of return and impact on our profitability 
we are pursuing opportunities to reduce our costs through continued vertical integration of component parts 
from time to time  we may expand our business  domestically or abroad  by acquiring other businesses or pursuing other strategic growth opportunities including  without limitation  joint ventures 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including costs that were capitalized related to maintenance  repair and replacement of existing assets and facilities  improvements for cost reduction purposes  expansion activities and costs associated with assets transferred from inventory to property  plant and equipment during the year 
most of our significant capital projects were completed in the new marmaduke flexible railcar manufacturing plant expansion  which is capable of producing tank  hopper and other railcar types  was completed in early and has begun producing railcars 
our wheel and axle assembly shop and our tank head press facility were also completed during and have begun production 
future liquidity our future liquidity includes our existing cash balance of million and our forecasted cash flow for we expect our future cash flows from operations to be impacted by pricing pressures  the number of railcar orders  productions rates and number of railcar shipments along with the state of the credit markets and the overall economy 
we believe that these sources of funds will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our expected operating requirements over the next twelve months 
our long term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our indenture and our revolving credit facility and any other indebtedness 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other investments 
these capital requirements could be substantial 
our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under risk factors  and trends and uncertainties discussed in this discussion and analysis  including those factors discussed under factors affecting operating results  as well as elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also materially adversely affect our long term liquidity 
for  our current capital expenditure plans include approximately million of projects that we expect will maintain equipment  expand capacity  improve efficiencies or reduce costs  as well as fund investments in joint ventures 
these capital expenditure plans include expenditures to further integrate our supply chain and various capital expenditures related to projects that have carried over into the amount set forth above is an estimate only 
we cannot assure that we will be able to complete any of our projects on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 

table of contents other potential projects  including possible strategic acquisitions that could complement and expand our business units  will be evaluated to determine if the project or opportunity is right for us 
we anticipate that any future expansion of our business will be financed through existing resources  cash flow from operations  term debt associated directly with that project or other new financing 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet existing financial covenants or obtain term debt or other new financing on favorable terms  if at all 
dividends the board of directors declared regular cash dividends of per share of our common stock for each quarter of  and on march   the board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share of our common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  these dividends are payable on april  we intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future at the discretion of our board of directors  depending upon our operating results  strategic plans  capital requirements  financial condition  debt covenants and other factors 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations senior unsecured notes interest payments on senior unsecured notes fees related to revolving credit agreement pension funding postretirement funding total the operating lease commitment includes the future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases for property and equipment leased by us 
on february   we issued million of senior unsecured notes that are due on march  the interest rate on these notes is 
these notes have interest payments due semiannually on march and september of every year 
our revolving credit facility  as amended  permits us to borrow up to million  subject to applicable covenants  until expiration in october we have no borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility as of december  our pension funding commitments includes minimum funding contributions required by law for our two funded pension plans as well as expected benefit payments for our one unfunded pension plan 
our postretirement health care benefit plan is unfunded thus the company must fund benefit payments 
the company has excluded from the contractual obligation table above  its gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits of million 
while it is uncertain as to the amount  if any  of these unrecognized tax benefits that will be settled by means of a cash payment  the company anticipates a reduction in the liability within the next year to be in the range of million to million  as referenced in note in our consolidated financial statements 
this anticipated reduction is primarily due to the expiration of statute of limitations 

table of contents we entered into a contract in june to purchase the land and building of our la porte  texas facility that is currently being leased 
the lease expires on may  and at that time  we will purchase the property for million 
in  we entered into two vendor supply contracts with minimum volume commitments with suppliers of materials used at our railcar production complexes 
our commitments under these agreements are set to be satisfied in early we have agreed to purchase a combined total of million from these two suppliers from through in  we expect to purchase million under these agreements 
during  we entered into two supply agreements with a steel supplier for the purchase of certain types of steel plate 
the agreements each have terms of five years and may be terminated by either party at any time after two years  upon twelve months prior notice 
each agreement requires us to purchase a minimum volume requirement for the steel covered by that agreement at prices that fluctuate with the market 
we have no commitment under these arrangements to buy a minimum amount of steel  other than the minimum percentages  if our overall steel purchases decline 
in  we entered into an agreement with two parties  including one of the members of the ohio castings joint venture and an affiliate of one of the members of the ohio castings joint venture  to purchase a minimum of of certain of our railcar component requirements for the years  and in july  ari entered into an agreement with its joint venture  axis  to purchase all of its requirements of new railcar axles from a facility to be constructed by the joint venture 
operations are expected to begin the second quarter of in  we entered into natural gas contracts that contain fixed price and minimum volume purchase requirements  with purchase requirements of million remaining as of december  the company entered into a foreign currency option in october  to purchase canadian dollars cad with us dollars usd from october through april  with fixed exchange rates and exchange limits each month 
in  we expended million usd to purchase cad under this option 
we have committed to purchase cad for million usd in to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to capital expenditures for the expansion of our canadian repair operations 
contingencies in connection with our investment in ohio castings  we have guaranteed bonds amounting to million issued by the state of ohio to ohio castings  of which million was outstanding as of december  we also have a guarantee on a million state loan that provides for purchases of capital equipment  of which million was outstanding as of december  the two other partners of ohio castings have made identical guarantees of these obligations 
one of our joint ventures  axis  llc  entered into a credit agreement in december in connection with this event  we agreed to a guaranty of axis  llc s obligation under its credit agreement during the construction and start up phases of the facility 
subject to its terms and conditions  the guaranty will terminate on the earlier of i the repayment in full of the guaranteed obligations or ii after the facility has been in continuous production at a level sufficient to meet the facility s projected financial performance and in any event not less than consecutive days from the certified completion of the facility s construction 
as of december   axis  llc had approximately million outstanding under the credit agreement 
this guaranty has a maximum exposure related to it of million  exclusive of any capitalized interest  fees  costs and expenses 
our initial partner in the joint venture has provided the same guarantee relating to this credit agreement 

table of contents we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
these laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our current or formerly owned or operated facilities  and our own negligent acts  but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
we are involved in investigation and remediation activities at properties that we now own or lease to address historical contamination and potential contamination by third parties 
we are involved with state agencies in the cleanup of two sites under these laws 
these investigations are in process but it is too early to be able to make a reasonable estimate  with any certainty  of the timing and extent of remedial actions that may be required  and the costs that would be involved in such remediation 
substantially all of the issues identified relate to the use of the properties prior to their transfer to us in by acf and for which acf has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us 
acf has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues 
however  if acf fails to honor our obligations to us  we would be responsible for the cost of such remediation 
we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
we have been named the defendant in a lawsuit  oci chemical corporation v 
american railcar industries  inc  in which the plaintiff  oci chemical company oci  claims we were responsible for the damage caused by allegedly defective railcars that were manufactured by us 
the lawsuit was filed on september   in the united states district court  eastern district of missouri 
mediation on november   was not successful 
another mediation is scheduled to take place on march  and trial has been scheduled for april  we believe that we are not responsible for the damage and have meritorious defenses against such liability 
while we believe it is reasonably possible that this case could result in a loss to us we do not believe there is sufficient information to estimate the amount of such loss  if any  resulting from the lawsuit 
we have also been named the defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit  jennifer nicole lerma v 
american railcar industries  inc the lawsuit was filed on august   in the circuit court of greene county  arkansas civil division 
mediation on january   was not successful and trial is scheduled for august  we believe that we are not responsible and have meritorious defenses against such liability 
while we believe it is reasonably possible that this case could result in a loss to us we do not believe there is sufficient information to estimate the amount of such loss  if any  resulting from the lawsuit 
we are from time to time party to various other legal proceedings arising out of our business 
such proceedings  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
we believe that there are no proceedings pending against us that if the outcome was unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates and policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of these policies involve a high degree of judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies  in management s judgment  are those described below 
if different assumptions or conditions prevail  or if our estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect  actual results could be materially different from those reported 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues from railcar sales are recognized following completion of manufacturing  inspection  customer acceptance and shipment  which is when title and risk for any damage or loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer 
in some cases  painting and lining work may be outsourced to an independent contractor and  as a result  the sale for the railcar may be recorded after customer acceptance when it leaves the manufacturing plant and the sale for the lining work may be separately recorded following completion of that work by the independent contractor  customer acceptance and final shipments 
revenues from railcar and industrial components are recorded at the time of product shipment  in accordance with our contractual terms 
revenue for railcar maintenance services is recognized upon completion and shipment of railcars from our plants 
revenue for fleet management services is recognized as performed 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
the criteria for determining impairment related to long lived assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying value of the long lived assets to be held and used to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
if the assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is measured using the difference between the carrying amount of assets and the fair value of the assets 
the estimated fair value of the assets is measured by estimating the present value of the future discounted cash flows to be generated 
any future determination requiring write off of a significant portion of long lived assets recorded on our balance sheet could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill recorded in conjunction with a past business acquisition  all allocated to our kennett custom railcar sub assembly plants reporting unit within the manufacturing operations segment 
goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit 
purchase business combination accounting rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared to the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit  and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount  if lower 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment review on march of each year 
during the fourth quarter of  there were severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity  which had significant adverse impacts on stock markets  which contributed to a significant decline in our company s stock price and corresponding market capitalization 
for most of the fourth quarter  our market capitalization value was significantly below the recorded net book value of our balance sheet  including goodwill 
based on these overriding factors  as required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  indicators existed that we have experienced a significant adverse change in the business climate and we must review for impairment the fair value of the reporting unit associated with our goodwill 

table of contents because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets 
a key component of these fair value determinations is a reconciliation of the sum of these net present value calculations to our market capitalization 
we used the market capitalization value as of december   for the purposes of this reconciliation 
the goodwill accounting principles proscribed in sfas acknowledge that the observed market prices of individual trades of a company s stock and thus its computed market capitalization may not be representative of the fair value of the company as a whole 
substantial value may arise from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over another entity 
consequently  measuring the fair value of a collection of assets and liabilities that operate together in a controlled entity is different from measuring the fair value of that entity s individual common stock 
therefore  once the above net present value calculations have been determined we also add a control premium to the calculations 
this control premium is judgmental and is based on observed acquisitions in our industry 
the resulting fair values calculated for the reporting units are then compared to observable metrics on large mergers and acquisitions in our industry to determine whether those valuations  in our judgment  appear reasonable 
after determining the fair values of our various reporting units as of december   it was determined that our kennett custom reporting unit passed the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
based on this assessment  we concluded that the fair value of the goodwill was not impaired 
the valuation performed as of december  uses various assumptions about projected cash flows  discount rates  long term rates of return  and capital structure 
as mentioned above  the occurrence of actual cash flows or various rates could have an adverse change in the fair value of our goodwill and cause it to be impaired 
a increase in the discount rate used would cause the fair value of the reporting unit to decrease by 
at this increased discount rate  the goodwill would not be impaired 
a increase in the discount rate would cause the fair value of the reporting unit to decrease by and cause it to be impaired 
a decrease in the cash flow assumptions used  ie decreased pre tax income  would cause the fair value of the reporting unit to decrease 
at this decreased cash flow amount  the goodwill would not be impaired 
a decrease in the cash flow assumptions used would cause the fair value of the reporting unit to decrease and cause it to be impaired 
product warranties we record a liability for an estimate of costs that we expect to incur under our basic limited warranty when manufacturing revenue is recognized 
warranty terms are based on the negotiated railcar sales contracts and typically are for periods of up to five years 
factors affecting our warranty liability include the number of units sold and historical and anticipated rates of claims and costs per claim 
we assess quarterly the adequacy of our warranty liability based on changes in these factors 
actual results differing from estimates could have a material effect on results from operations in the event that unforeseen warranty issues were to occur 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position on a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different from that taken by us  differences in a tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
any such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 

table of contents we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate for recoverability our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of december   we had approximately million in net deferred tax liabilities net of million of deferred tax assets 
at this time  we consider it more likely than not that we will have taxable income in the future that will allow us to realize our deferred tax assets 
as a result  no valuation allowance is currently recorded 
however  it is possible that some or all of our deferred tax assets could ultimately expire unused 
during  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 accounting for income taxes fin  which required us to record a liability related to unrecognized tax positions 
see our discussion of this in note in our consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected investment return on plan assets  mortality rates and retirement rates  as discussed below discount rates the discount rate assumption used to determine end of year benefit obligations was for our pension plans and for our postretirement benefit plans 
we review these rates annually and adjust them to reflect current conditions 
based on our review  we set the rates for at and 
we deemed these rates appropriate based on the citigroup pension discount curve analysis along with expected payments to retirees under the bude and shippers plans 
health care cost trend rates our health care cost trend rate of for related to our postretirement benefit plan is based on historical retiree cost data  near term health care outlook  including appropriate cost control measures implemented by us and industry benchmarks and surveys 
compensation increase our compensation increase rate of per year related to our postretirement benefit plan is based on historical experience 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets for our funded pension plans of for is derived from detailed periodic studies  which include a review of asset allocation strategies  anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  risks standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix 
while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  the assumptions are primarily long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality and retirement rates mortality and retirement rates are based on actual and anticipated plan experience 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense

various economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
environmental we are involved in investigation and remediation activities at properties that we now own or lease to address historic contamination and potential contamination by third parties 
we are also involved with state agencies in the cleanup of two sites under these laws 
these investigations are in process but it is too early to be able to make a reasonable estimate  with any certainty  of the timing and extent of remedial actions that may be required  and the costs that would be involved in such remediation 
substantially all of the issues identified relate to the use of the properties prior to their transfer to us in by acf and for which acf has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us 
acf has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues 
we expect that we will be indemnified for these environmental matters 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings  or that we will be able to recover under our indemnity provisions if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  or that such costs would not be material to us 

table of contents stock based compensation in january  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issues to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards on their grant dates 
our share based awards include stock options  stock appreciation rights sars and restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our equity instrument awards and other share based awards issued under the equity incentive plan 
the black scholes model requires estimates of the expected term of the option  future volatility  dividend yield  forfeiture rate and the risk free interest rate 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  which addressed the expected term aspect of the black scholes model 
it stated that companies that did not have adequate exercise history on equity instruments were allowed to use the simplified method prescribed by the sec  which called for an average of the vesting period and the expiration period of grants with plain vanilla characteristics 
these characteristics included service based vesting  instruments granted at the money along with certain other requirements 
both our stock options and sars have fair value estimates that are generated from the black scholes calculation 
this calculation requires inputs as mentioned above that may require some judgment or estimation 
we use our best judgment at the time of the grant to estimate fair value on the stock options to record the expense of those options over the vesting period of those options 
for the sars granted in and  these are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet and must be revalued every period 
as such  the fair value estimates on the sars we granted to our employees are subject to volatility inherent in the stock price since it is based on current market values at the end of every period 
our sars settle in cash 
as of december   all compensation costs related to both the vested and the unvested portion of stock options have been recognized 
the remaining unvested stock options vested on january  as of december   unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested portion of sars were approximately million and are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately months 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  amounts due to from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the short term maturity of these instruments 
the fair value of long term debt is calculated by discounting cash flows through maturity using our current rate of borrowing for similar liabilities 
the fair values of the short term investment in the greenbrier companies common stock and canadian dollar option contract are based upon current market data and exchange rates 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information about the financial instrument in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  to create greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any controlling interest  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies to fiscal years beginning after december  management believes the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the guidance will become effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year on january  management believes the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands quarterly disclosure requirements in sfas about an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  management believes the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on potential borrowings we may incur under our revolving credit facility  as amended 
however  we do not plan to enter into swaps or other hedging arrangements to manage this risk because we do not believe the risk is significant 
on an annual basis  a change in the interest rate in our revolving credit facility will increase or decrease our interest expense by  for every million of outstanding borrowings 
we are exposed to price risks associated with the purchase of raw materials  especially steel and heavy castings 
the cost of steel  heavy castings and all other materials used in the production of our railcars represents approximately of our direct manufacturing costs 
given the significant increases in the price of raw materials since november  this exposure can affect our costs of production 
we believe that the risk to our margins and profitability has been greatly reduced by the variable pricing contracts we now have in place with many of our current railcar manufacturing contracts with our customers 
these contracts adjust the purchase prices of our railcars to reflect increases or decreases in the cost of certain raw materials and components and  as a result  we are able to pass on to our customers most of the increased raw material and component costs with respect to the railcars we plan to produce and deliver during we believe that we currently have excellent supplier relationships and do not anticipate that material constraints will limit our production capacity 
such constraints may exist if railcar production was to increase beyond current levels  or other economic changes were to occur that affect the availability of our raw materials 
we have entered into natural gas contracts that contain fixed price and minimum purchase requirements  with purchase requirements of million remaining as of december   that expose us to the risk of natural gas price fluctuations 
we believe that the risk to our margins is not significant given that natural gas represents a small portion of our direct manufacturing costs 
however  if the price of natural gas were to significantly decrease during we would be paying higher prices than our competitors 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks as a result of our canadian repair operations and the foreign currency option to purchase cad for million usd 
we have committed to purchasing cad to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to capital expenditures for the expansion of our canadian repair operations  which could result in significant losses if the exchange rate were to rapidly become unfavorable for us
