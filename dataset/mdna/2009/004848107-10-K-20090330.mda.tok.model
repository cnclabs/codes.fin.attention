item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
item a risk factors we may from time to time make written or oral statements that contain forward looking information 
however  our actual results may differ materially from our expectations  statements or projections 
the following risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from our expectations  statements or projections 
general factors the current crisis in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as widely reported  global credit and financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruptions in recent months  including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  declines in economic growth  increases in unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
we can provide no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets have lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending  which may cause our customers to cancel  decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
the continuing disruption in the credit markets has severely restricted access to capital 
as a result  the ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations or refinance maturing obligations as they become due is significantly constrained 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions  and if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we have a history of operating losses and have used increasing amounts of cash for operations and to fund our acquisitions and investments 
we have a history of operating losses  and have used significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities over the years 
in  and  we had operating losses of million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in operations in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
despite selling a significant portion of our comverge investment during the period from december through september and receiving proceeds net of transaction costs of approximately million and raising approximately million approximately million net of transaction costs in from the private placement of our convertible debentures  we have utilized a significant portion of those funds in our recent acquisitions and investment activity 
in addition  we continue to pursue additional investments and may need to support the financing needs of our subsidiaries 
while we currently have enough cash on hand to fund our operations for the next months  we may need additional funds to finance the investment and acquisition activity we wish to undertake 
we do not know if such funds will be available if needed on terms that we consider acceptable 
we may have to limit or adjust our investment acquisition strategy or sell some of our assets in order to continue to pursue our corporate goals 
we depend on key management for the success of our business 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of john a 
moore  our ceo  william j 
mcmahon  ceo of coalogix scr tech  benny sela  ceo of dsit  ray simonson  ceo of coreworx and other key employees 
the loss of the services of any key employee could materially harm our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
although to date we have been successful in retaining the services of senior management and have entered into employment agreements with them  members of our senior management may terminate their employment agreements without cause and with notice periods ranging up to days 
we may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available 
loss of the services of a few key employees could harm our operations 
we depend on our key management  technical employees and sales personnel 
the loss of certain managers could diminish our ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers and potential customers 
the loss of certain technical personnel could harm our ability to meet development and implementation schedules 
the loss of key sales personnel could have a negative effect on sales to certain current customers 
most of our significant employees are bound by confidentiality and non competition agreements 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
if we fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  our business could be disrupted 
a failure to integrate our new management may adversely affect us 
in august  we acquired coreworx and its entire management team 
any failure to effectively integrate coreworx s new management into our controls  systems and procedures could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance  public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations 
keeping informed of  and in compliance with  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and accounting standards  including the sarbanes oxley act  as well as new and proposed sec regulations and accounting standards  has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources 
compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities 
businesses we acquire may have disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting that are weaker than or otherwise not in conformity with ours 
we have a history of acquiring businesses with varying levels of organizational size and complexity 
upon consummating an acquisition  we seek to implement our disclosure controls and procedures as well as our internal controls over financial reporting at the acquired company as promptly as possible 
depending upon the size and complexity of the business acquired  the implementation of our disclosure controls and procedures as well as the implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting at an acquired company may be a lengthy process 
typically  we conduct due diligence prior to consummating an acquisition  however  our integration efforts may periodically expose deficiencies in the disclosure controls and procedures as well as in internal controls over financial reporting of an acquired company 
we expect that the process involved in completing the integration of our own disclosure controls and procedures as well as our own internal controls over financial reporting at an acquired business will sufficiently correct any identified deficiencies 
however  if such deficiencies exist  we may not be in a position to comply with our periodic reporting requirements and  as a result  our business and financial condition may be materially harmed 
our awards of stock options to employees may not have their intended effect 
a portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our common shares or the common stock of our subsidiaries 
if the price of our common stock performs poorly  such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel 
in addition  any changes made to our stock option policies  or to any other of our compensation practices  which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 
we may not be able to successfully integrate companies which we may invest in or acquire in the future  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
our strategy is to continue to expand in the future  including through acquisitions 
integrating acquisitions is often costly  and we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies with our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences 
integrating our acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business  including failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies  dilution of existing stockholders  potential disruption of our ongoing business activities and distraction of our management  difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies  difficulties in coordinating and integrating overall business strategies  sales and marketing  and research and development efforts  and the difficulty of establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  including accounting controls and procedures 
if any of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems  the same could adversely affect the reputation of our group of companies and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
moreover  any significant acquisition could require substantial use of our capital and may require significant debt or equity financing 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing or its effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
we incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting  and other expenses in connection with our reporting requirements 
both the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time and effort we devote to compliance activities 
we expect these rules and regulations to further increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make compliance and other activities more time consuming and costly 
we continue to regularly monitor and evaluate developments with respect to these new rules with our legal counsel  but we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
we are currently involved in litigation and may in the future may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us we are currently parties to two pending litigation matters which are described under item legal proceedings 
also  from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may become involved in various legal proceedings  including commercial  product liability  employment  class action and other litigation and claims  as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  because litigation is inherently unpredictable  the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions is subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result  we could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standard number  goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed at least annually or more frequently  if certain conditions exist 
any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill will result in a charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods 
the financial soundness of our customers could affect our business and operating results 
as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  our customers may experience cash flow concerns 
as a result  if customers operating and financial performance deteriorates  or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable owed to us 
any inability of current and or potential customers to pay us for services may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
while we have not reported any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting in the past  we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
over time  controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
as a result  we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations  or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated thereunder 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or our intellectual property protection efforts are unsuccessful  others may duplicate our technology 
our operating companies rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology  systems designs and manufacturing processes 
the ability of others to use our intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of our products and reduce our competitive advantage 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will issue or  in the case of patents issued  that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes 
further  a patent issued covering one use of our technology may not be broad enough to cover uses of that technology in other business areas 
even if all our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad  they may be challenged or invalidated or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are equivalent or superior to ours 
we could incur substantial costs in prosecuting patent and other intellectual property infringement suits and defending the validity of our patents and other intellectual property 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our property rights  we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so 
these actions could place our patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights at risk and could result in the loss of patent  trademark or other intellectual property rights protection for the products  systems and services on which our business strategy partly depends 
we rely  to a significant degree  on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
these trade secrets cannot be protected by patent protection 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products and services if these claims are successful 
we also may incur significant expenses in affirmatively protecting our intellectual property rights 

in recent years  there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in many technology related industries and we believe our industry has a significant amount of patent activity 
third parties may claim that the technology or intellectual property that we incorporate into or use to develop  manufacture or provide our current and future products  systems or services infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and may be required to obtain a license to use those rights 
we may also be required to engage in costly efforts to design our products  systems and services around the intellectual property rights of others 
the intellectual property rights of others may cover some of our technology  products  systems and services 
in addition  the scope and validity of any particular third party patent may be subject to significant uncertainty 
litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or to indemnify our customers 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any inability on our part to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we also may be required to incur significant time and expense in pursuing claims against companies we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights 
we are currently pursuing one such claim as described under item legal proceedings 
the complexity of our technology and the nature of intellectual property litigation would make it expensive and potentially difficult to prove that a competitor is in fact infringing on our intellectual property rights  but we have commenced such litigation as described under item litigation and may find it necessary to commence such litigation in the future to protect our rights and future business opportunities 
we can offer no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation 
risks related to coalogix scr tech has incurred significant net losses since inception and may never achieve sustained profitability 
scr tech has incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we believe that scr tech will significantly improve its operating results in  however  we can provide no assurance that scr tech will generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
scr tech has a limited operating history scr tech commenced commercial operations in march thus scr tech does not have a long term operational history sufficient to allow us to determine whether it can successfully operate its business under differing environments and conditions or at any level of sustained profitability 
the size of the market for scr tech s business is uncertain 
scr tech offers scr catalyst cleaning  rejuvenation and regeneration  as well as scr system management and consulting services 
the size and growth rate for this market will ultimately be determined by a number of factors  including environmental regulations  the growth in the use of scr systems to reduce nox and other pollutants  the length of operation of scr systems  the adoption of regeneration versus replacement  the expansion of warranty coverage from scr catalyst oems  the cost of new scr catalyst  and other factors  most of which are beyond the control of scr tech 
there is limited historical evidence in the united states as to the cycle of replacement  cleaning and regeneration of scr catalyst so as to accurately estimate the potential growth of the business 
in addition  the number of times a catalyst can be regenerated is unknown  which also may affect the demand for regeneration in lieu of purchasing new catalyst 
any delay in the development of the market could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
scr tech will be subject to vigorous competition with very large competitors that have substantially greater resources and operating histories 
we are aware of one company  evonik energy services  llc  formerly known as steag evonik llc  which entered the us catalyst regeneration market in evonik llc has currently built a regeneration facility in north carolina 
evonik llc  based in kings mountain  north carolina  is a subsidiary of a german power producer  evonik steag gmbh evonik gmbh 
evonik gmbh is very large and has substantially greater resources than scr tech or us 
competition from evonik may have a material adverse effect on our operations  including a potential reduction in operating margins and a loss of potential business 
we are also aware of at least one other company  enerfab  inc that provides scr catalyst management  rejuvenation and cleaning services 
we are aware of certain companies  including cormetech and babcock hitachi  who have indicated an interest in offering catalyst cleaning and regeneration 
there also are a number of scr catalyst manufacturers with substantial parent companies that may seek to maintain market share by significantly reducing prices which will put pressure on our operating margins 
these companies include cormetech inc owned by mitsubishi heavy industries and corning  inc  argillon group owned by johnson matthey  ceram  haldor topsoe  inc and babcock hitachi 
further  if the scr catalyst regeneration market expands as we expect  additional competitors could emerge 
in addition  if our intellectual property protection is weakened  competition could more easily develop 
scr tech s lawsuit against evonik energy services llc  et al 
may not be successful  and the counterclaims of evonik energy services llc against scr tech may be successful 
we will incur significant expenses in pursuing our lawsuit against evonik and in defending against evonik s counterclaims 
scr tech s lawsuit against evonik energy services  llc and other defendants as described in item  legal proceedings  is associated with certain significant risks 
the lawsuit will require the time and attention of senior management of scr tech  and could divert attention from other business matters 
expenses of the lawsuit may cause a diversion of significant funds needed by scr tech to fund operations for other aspects of the business 
due to the nature of litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the lawsuit 
we anticipate that the evonik llc defendants will vigorously defend themselves  and that evonik llc will vigorously pursue its counterclaims against scr tech 
in the event scr tech is unsuccessful in the lawsuit and evonik llc prevails in its counterclaims  evonik llc may be awarded substantial damages against scr tech 
scr tech has not reserved funds for any loss contingency or legal fees associated with this litigation 
in addition  if scr tech is unsuccessful  evonik llc will remain a competitor of scr tech 
coalogix may not prevail in the lawsuit filed against it by environmental energy systems  inc the lawsuit brought by environmental energy services  inc ees against coalogix is associated with certain significant risks 
the lawsuit will require the time and attention of senior management of coalogix  and could divert attention from other business matters 
expenses of the lawsuit may cause a diversion of significant funds needed by coalogix to fund operations for other aspects of the business 
due to the nature of litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the lawsuit 
in the event coalogix is unsuccessful in defending the lawsuit and ees prevails in its claims  ees may be awarded substantial damages against coalogix including costs  interest and attorneys fees 
coalogix has not reserved funds for any loss contingency or legal fees associated with this litigation 
in addition  if ees prevails and obtains rights to ifs c  ees will be a competitor in the mercury reduction business 
scr tech s business is subject to customer concentration 
scr tech offers scr catalyst cleaning  rejuvenation and regeneration  as well as scr system management and consulting services to coal fired power plants 
some of the utilities operating these plants are exceptionally large and operate a number of such power plants 
thus  one or more large utilities could provide a very large order or orders to scr tech which likely would result in one or two such utilities providing most of the orders and revenues for scr tech for a particular quarterly or annual period 
during fiscal  three customers represented about of our revenue 
during  four customers represented more than of our revenue 
although such large orders is beneficial to scr tech by providing a large and consistent source of orders and revenues without the additional cost associated with marketing to a larger number of smaller customers  scr tech is dependent on a small number of large utilities for its business 
the loss of one of these customers would have a much greater adverse effect on scr tech than the loss of a smaller customer 
this may also result in significant swings in orders and revenues on a quarterly basis as well as impacting on our cash flows 
scr tech s business may be impacted by changes in government regulation 
our business is significantly dependent on the nature and level of government regulation of emissions 
for instance  the environmental protection agency s epa clean air interstate rule cair was vacated by the district of columbia court of appeals in july  and was subsequently re instated in december by the same court just days before the vacature became effective 
we expect the epa to revise cair or replace it with other clean air regulations  but we cannot at this time to predict the nature of such revisions or replacement regulations 
without government regulation of coal fired power generation  scr catalyst would not be used by utilities  there would be no need for utilities to acquire  clean or regenerate scr catalyst  and scr tech would have no business purpose 
further  changes in or adverse interpretations of governmental accounting or rate based emissions regulations also could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although government regulation of emissions has become increasingly stringent in recent years  the growing costs associated with such regulations and the economic downturn in the us may limit the level of increase and scope of emissions requirements  which could limit the potential growth of our target markets 
any easing  delay or deferral of governmental emissions requirements or the growth rate of such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
scr tech s business is subject to potential seasonality 
prior to the january  effective date of phase i of cair  some utilities and ipps operated their scr units only during the ozone season may september 
because of this  scr tech s business was more limited than if scr units were required to operate on a continual basis 
during non ozone season periods  most operators had limited if any requirements to run their scr systems 
given that phase i of cair effectively requires operators run their scr systems on a continual basis beginning january   we expect less concentration of scr tech s business during the ozone season each year 
however  utilities and ipps may continue to schedule outages and down time for maintenance during periods beyond our control  resulting in seasonality of scr tech s business 
these potential fluctuations in revenues and cash flow during a year may be significant and could materially impact our quarterly earnings and cash flow 
this may have a material adverse effect on the perception of our business and the market price for our common stock 
scr tech does not own its regeneration facilities and it is subject to risks inherent in leasing the site of its operations 
scr tech does not own its regeneration site  instead it leases it from clariant corporation  the us subsidiary of a switzerland based public company clariant 
although we believe the lease terms are favorable  the dependence on clariant and the site could subject scr tech to increased risk in the event clariant experiences financial setbacks or loses its right to operate the site 
this risk is heightened because the site is a federal superfund site under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  which increases the risks that the site ultimately could be shut down or that clariant will be financially unable to continue its ownership of the site 
it may be difficult to relocate to another site on a timely or cost effective basis  and scr tech s business could be negatively impacted by any problems with continuing to conduct its operations at its current site 
scr tech could be subject to environmental risks as a result of the operation of its business and the location of its facilities 
the operation of scr tech s business and the nature of its assets create various environmental risks 
scr tech leases its site for operations at a property listed on the national priority list as a federal superfund site 
five cercla areas those areas of concern identified under the cercla program are identified on the property  and while scr tech does not lease any property identified as a cercla area  one such cercla area has resulted in contamination of groundwater flowing underneath one of the buildings leased by scr tech 
although scr tech has indemnification from clariant for any environmental liability arising prior to the operation of scr tech s business at the site  we can provide no assurance that such indemnification will be sufficient or that scr tech would be protected from an environmental claim from the nature of the site 
in addition  the operation of scr tech s business involves removal of hazardous wastes from catalyst and the use of significant chemical materials 
as a result  scr tech could be subject to potential liability resulting from such operations 
to date  neither acorn nor scr tech has been identified as a potential responsible party to such environmental risks  nor have any amounts been recorded to accrue for these potential exposures 
we likely will be required to make significant capital expenditures to expand scr tech s production facilities or for other purposes  we may require additional capital for such purposes 
we believe this site is sufficient to meet scr tech s anticipated production requirements through however  in order to meet anticipated demand for increased orders for scr regeneration services in and beyond  we expect to incur substantial capital expenditure costs over the next two years to construct a second scr regeneration plant 
because of necessary permitting  site search  time for construction and equipment purchases  we can provide no assurance that scr tech could meet the demands from a rapid increase in orders in a timely manner 
any failure to timely fulfill such orders could have an adverse impact on scr tech s business 
in addition there is no assurance that coalogix will be able to raise the necessary funds from its current shareholders or outside sources to construct a new regeneration facility 
moreover  if we incur the expected capital expenditures to expand the capacity of scr tech  but the market does not develop as we expect or increased competition results in loss of significant business  we may not generate enough additional revenue from such expenses 
this could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
moreover  other unanticipated expenses for scr tech  such as litigation or other costs for protecting intellectual property rights or as a result of a significant corporate transaction could result in the need for additional capital 
these additional funding requirements may be significant  and funds may not be available when required or may be available only on terms unsatisfactory to us 
beyond december   our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the market acceptance of our product and service offerings  the ability of scr tech to generate significant cash flow  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the rate of expansion of our production capacity  our ability to manage selling  general and administrative expenditures and the timing and extent of scr tech related research and development projects 
in addition  we continue to actively pursue business opportunities  including but not limited to  mergers  acquisitions or other strategic arrangements 
such strategic opportunities could require the use of additional cash  reducing our available capital prior to december   or could require additional equity or debt financing 
the nature and amount of any such financing or the use of any capital in any such transaction cannot be predicted and will depend on the terms and conditions of the particular transaction 
certain of scr tech s capital equipment is unique to our business and would be difficult and expensive to repair or replace 
certain of the capital equipment used in the services performed by scr tech has been developed and made specifically for us and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working 
in addition  certain of our equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors 
consequently  any damage to or breakdown of our equipment at a time when we are regenerating large amounts of scr catalyst at scr tech may have a material adverse impact on our business 
scr tech may be subject to warranty claims from its customers 
scr tech typically provides limited warranties to its customers relating to the level of success of its catalyst cleaning and regeneration services 
in the event scr tech is unable to perform a complete regeneration of an scr catalyst  scr tech may be required to re perform a regeneration or repay a portion of the fees earned for the regeneration efforts 
scr tech also may be required to provide warranties with respect to its other scr catalyst services provided to its customers 
since scr tech has only a limited operating history  it is not possible to determine the amount or extent of any potential warranty claims that scr tech may incur 
there is a risk that any such claims could be substantial and could affect the profitability of scr tech and the financial condition of the company 
the company does maintain a limited warranty claim liability  however  should the amount of any potential warranty claims be incurred at levels higher than the warranty liability  the profitability and financial condition of the company could be impacted 
scr tech is dependent on third parties to perform certain testing required to confirm successful regeneration 
in connection with the regeneration of scr catalyst  scr tech generally must have an independent company provide testing services to determine the level of success of regeneration 
currently there are a limited number of companies providing this service 
if scr tech is unable to obtain this service on a cost effective basis  scr tech may not be able to perform its regeneration services 
in addition  if the testing cannot be completed in a timely manner  there may be a slowdown of operations which can negatively impact the profitability and financial condition of the company 
significant price increases in key materials may reduce scr tech s gross margins and profitability of regeneration of scr catalyst 
the prices of various chemicals used to regenerate scr catalyst can be volatile 
if the long term costs of these materials were to increase significantly  we would attempt to reduce material usage or find substitute materials 
if these efforts were not successful or if these cost increases could not be reflected in our price to customers  then our gross margins and profitability of regenerating scr catalyst would be reduced and our ability to operate scr tech profitably could be compromised 
there are risks associated with our purchase of used scr catalyst 
scr tech s primary business involves the cleaning and regenerating of customer owned scr catalyst 
in certain instances  however  scr tech may purchase used or spent catalyst from utilities for regeneration  as when  for example  a utility wishes to avoid the costs and potential hazardous waste issues associated with the disposal of used or spent catalyst 
scr tech may purchase scr catalyst for a nominal sum and then regenerate such catalyst for immediate sale  or may purchase spent scr catalyst on an opportunistic basis for future regeneration and sale 
the purchase of spent scr catalyst involves potential risks to scr tech 
for example  spent scr catalyst includes significant hazardous waste  and unlike the regeneration of customer owned scr catalyst  the purchase of spent scr catalyst requires scr tech to take ownership or title to the scr catalyst  which may potentially increase scr tech s environmental risk exposure 
furthermore  if scr tech cannot find a customer to purchase the regenerated catalyst  then scr tech must either store the spent catalyst  subject to the inherent risk of holding catalyst which has not been regenerated and contains hazardous waste  or incur significant costs to dispose of the spent catalyst in a manner which complies with the strict requirements of applicable environmental laws 
in addition  the sale of scr catalyst may expose scr tech to risks not inherent in the cleaning and regeneration of scr catalyst  including product liability claims 
it is unclear as to the amount of scr catalyst which scr tech may purchase  but it is possible such purchases ultimately may be substantial  and may significantly increase the risk profile of scr tech s business 
many of the risks of our business have only limited insurance coverage and many of our business risks are uninsurable 
our business operations are subject to potential environmental  product liability  employee and other risks 
although we have insurance to cover some of these risks  the amount of this insurance is limited and includes numerous exceptions and limitations to coverage 
further  no insurance is available to cover certain types of risks  such as acts of god  war  terrorism  major economic and business disruptions and similar events 
in the event we were to suffer a significant environmental  product liability  employee or other claim in excess of our insurance or a loss or damages relating to an uninsurable risk  our financial condition could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the cost of our insurance has increased substantially in recent years and may prove to be prohibitively expensive  thus making it impractical to obtain insurance 
this may result in the need to abandon certain business activities or subject ourselves to the risks of uninsured operations 
new technologies could be developed which make scr catalyst obsolete 
scr tech s business is dependent upon the needs of coal fired power plants to replace or regenerate scr catalyst 
it is possible that at some point in the future new technology may be developed which replaces scr catalyst as the preferred solution for removing nox from the power plant exhaust 
in such event  scr tech s business would be materially and adversely affected 
new competitors could enter the regeneration business 
currently  we are aware of only one competitor in the scr regeneration business in the united states 
it is possible that at some time in the future new competitors will enter into the scr regeneration business 
manufacturers of scr catalyst may have an advantage if they chose to enter the scr regeneration business since they are familiar with the manufacture and properties of scr catalyst 
in addition original catalyst manufacturers may have greater financial resources available to them than does scr tech 
our business could be impacted by challenges to and developments in environmental legislation and regulations 
scr tech s business is in large part dependent upon federal and state legislation and regulations which require reductions in emissions from coal fired power plants 
we can provide no assurance that such legislation and regulations will not be challenged in the courts and possibly altered to the detriment of scr tech 
in addition  legislation and regulations could be changed in the future to be less stringent and relax or delay requirements on emissions from coal fired power plants 
our business may be impacted by the world wide financial crisis 
the current economic conditions and limited availability of credit may affect the ability of coalogix s customers to purchase services from coalogix 
this may result in deferral of projects by coalogix s customers  which would have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve planned sales 
the limited availability of credit may also affect coalogix s ability to fund its need to expand its production capabilities in in order to accommodate its anticipated growth 
coalogix anticipates that it will need to increase production capacity by constructing a new plant in in order to satisfy expected increased orders from customers  and coalogix current financial resources are not sufficient to provide the anticipated substantial cost to build a new plant 
coalogix is currently exploring options to provide funds for construction of a new plant 
however  we have no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary funds for the expansion at agreeable terms 
metallifix is a new technology and has no operating history 
the metallifix technology has been tested only in a limited number times at a bench scale  and not yet tested at the commercial scale 
although we believe the tests have been successful  a commercial test or full scale installation has not yet been achieved 
thus the metallifix technology has no operating history sufficient to allow us to determine whether it can be successful under the current or differing environments and conditions or at any level of profitability 
the size of the market for mercury removal and remediation is uncertain 
the epa s clean air and mercury rule camr was vacated by the dc circuit court of appeals in february  and there is uncertainty whether more stringent legislation will be implemented when camr will be reinstated and the timing of such 
the mercury removal regulations promulgated by individual states dictate current removal guidelines until camr takes effect  and the rate and timing of new state regulations is uncertain for the long term 
therefore  the overall market for mercury removal and remediation is difficult to predict 
any delay in the development of the mercury market could significantly and adversely affect the value of our metallifix offering 
there is currently only one supplier of key materials in the metallifix process 
the chemicals used in the metallifix process are currently obtained under license from solucorp industries ifs c technology 
one of the key chemicals in the ifs c technology is produced by solucorp in a foreign country 
we are not aware of any other producers of this chemical and are currently relying on solely on solucorp for our supply of this chemical 
this dependence on one supplier of a key chemical used in the metallifix process could have adverse impacts on our introduction of metallifix and on our ability to adequately satisfy agreements which we hope to enter into to remove mercury for customers and exploit this market 
metallifix will be subject to vigorous competition we are aware of other technologies that will compete with metallifix 
these include other fgd or scrubber additives that enhance the capture of mercury  sorbent injection technologies  and oxidizer technologies 
most mercury removal technologies are in the development and test stages for commercialization 
although the metallifix process is also being further tested  it may not prove to have a competitive advantage compared to other mercury removal technologies 
metallifix may not meet expected mercury removal levels  cost hurdles  safety standards  or another competitive characteristic that will become evident after further testing 
if we or solucorp industries are unable to protect the intellectual property  others may duplicate the technology 
we rely on solucorp s patented ifs c technology for the metallifix process 
our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on solucorp s ability to protect its patents 
the ability of others to use solucorp s intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of the metallifix offering and reduce our competitive advantage 
we cannot control solucorp s efforts to safeguard  maintain  and defend its intellectual property rights  and we cannot be assured whether solucorp will be completely successful in doing so 
these actions could place solucorp s intellectual property rights at risk and could result the loss of their patent on which our metallifix business strategy partly depends 
extensive and evolving environmental and health and safety laws and regulations may restrict our operations and growth and increase our costs 
existing environmental laws and regulations have become more stringently enforced in recent years because of greater public interest in protecting the environment 
in addition  the coal industry is subject to regular enactment of new or amended federal  state and local environmental and health and safety statutes  regulations and ballot initiatives  as well as judicial decisions interpreting these requirements 
these requirements may impose substantial capital and operating costs and operational limitations on us and may adversely affect our business 
the requirements may also effect our customers decisions to utilize our services which may materially adversely affect our business 
risks related to dsit solutions failure to accurately forecast costs of fixed priced contracts could reduce our margins 
when working on a fixed price basis  we undertake to deliver software or integrated hardware software solutions to a customer s specifications or requirements for a particular project 
the profits from these projects are primarily determined by our success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs 
costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors  including underestimating costs  difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract 
if  for any reason  our costs are substantially higher than expected  we may incur losses on fixed price contracts 
hostilities in the middle east region may slow down the israeli hi tech market and may harm our israeli operations  our israeli operations may be negatively affected by the obligations of our personnel to perform military service 
our software consulting and development services segment is currently conducted in israel 
accordingly  political  economic and military conditions in israel may directly affect dsit 
any increase in hostilities in the middle east involving israel could weaken the israeli hi tech market  which may result in a significant deterioration of the results of our israeli operations 
in addition  an increase in hostilities in israel could cause serious disruption to our israeli operations if acts associated with such hostilities result in any serious damage to our offices or those of our customers or harm to our personnel 
some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform military reserve duty 
in the event of severe unrest or other conflict  one or more of our key employees could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time 
in the past  there have been numerous call ups of military reservists to active duty  and it is possible that there will be additional call ups in the future 
our israeli operations could be disrupted as a result of such call ups for military service 
exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of our israeli operations 
a majority of dsit s sales are based on contracts or orders which are in u 
s dollars or euros or are in new israeli shekels nis linked to the us dollar 
at the same time  most of dsit s expenses are denominated in nis primarily labor costs and are not linked to any foreign currency 
while the dollar value of the revenues of our operations in israel will increase if the dollar is devalued in relation to the nis  the net effect of such devaluation is that dsit s costs in dollar terms increase more than our revenues 
the weakening of the dollar relative to the nis had a net negative impact on dsit s operations in during the period from january  to june   the dollar lost of its value relative to the nis before recovering and finishing just below the value at december  dsit is currently considering ways to control is exposures to exchange rate fluctuations  however  we can provide no assurance that such controls will be implemented successfully 
we are substantially dependent on a small number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers may cause revenues and cash flow to decline 
in  of dsit s sales in were concentrated in one customer israel defense ministry 
in addition  in  dsit has received million of orders from a new customer 
both of these customers are expected to make up a significant portion of dsit s revenues and cash flow for a significant reduction of future orders or delay in milestone payments from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of dsit 
we are dependent on meeting milestones to provide cash flow for operations 
in august  we sold our outsourcing business  which in the past provided our israeli operations with a steady cash flow stream  and  in conjunction with bank lines of credit  helped to finance our israeli operations 
our present operations  as we are currently structured  place a greater reliance on our meeting project milestones in order to generate cash flow to finance our operations 
should we encounter difficulties in meeting significant project milestones  resulting cash flow difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
if we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological change  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may suffer 
some of our solutions are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence 
our competitiveness and future success depends on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
a fundamental shift in technologies could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
our failure to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products  which could result in technological obsolescence  decreased revenues  and or a loss of market share to competitors 
to the extent that we fail to keep pace with technological change  our revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we must at times provide significant guarantees in order to secure projects 
some of the projects we perform require significant performance and or bank guarantees 
in dsit s current state  it may not always be able to supply such guarantees without financial assistance from acorn 
if acorn needs to provide financial guarantees for dsit  acorn may not have sufficient funds available to it to invest in other emerging ventures or take advantage of opportunities available to us in a timely manner 
we are technologically dependent on several key employees 
our sonar and acoustic related solutions and products are dependent on the knowledge and know how of several persons 
the loss of any or a combination of these persons could harm our ability to meet project deadlines and our ability to market certain products 
as our sonar and acoustic related solutions is a significant portion of our growth strategy  this would ultimately negatively impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
while we are attempting to mitigate this risk by hiring and training additional personnel  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in doing so in a cost effective and timely manner 
we are dependent on a number of suppliers who provide us with components for some of our products 
a number of our suppliers provide us with major components for some of our products for our naval rt solutions 
some of these components are long lead items 
if for some reason  the suppliers cannot provide us with the component when we need it and we cannot easily find substitute suppliers on similar terms  we may have increased costs and or delays in delivering a product to a customer and incur penalties and lose customer confidence 
in addition  project delays can also slow down revenue recognition and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
while we are constantly attempting to develop secondary and tertiary suppliers for these components  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in doing so on terms acceptable to us 
dsit incurred significant net losses in recent years and may never achieve sustained profitability 
dsit has incurred net losses of million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although dsit recorded net income of million for the year ended december   and we believe that dsit will improve its operating results in  we can provide no assurance that dsit will continue to generate sufficient revenues to allow it to sustain profitability 
we are dependent on one bank for most of our financing needs and we may not be able to obtain necessary financing to continue growing the company 
while dsit has increased its lines of credit during from nis  approximately  to nis  approximately  dsit needs additional financing from time to time due to the timing of large milestone payments 
due to historical losses  dsit has found it difficult to find a suitable secondary bank to support its financing needs 
if we cannot increase our sources of financing  we may not be able to sustain our recent growth and invest in expanding our portfolio of products 
we are a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors  which may hinder our ability to compete effectively 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than we have 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours  which would allow them to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
risks related to coreworx coreworx has incurred significant net losses since inception and may never achieve sustained profitability 
coreworx has incurred net losses of cdn million and cdn million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   it had an accumulated deficit of approximately cdn million 
we believe that coreworx will reduce its losses in  however  we can provide no assurance that coreworx will generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
coreworx may need additional financing cash used in operations in and was cdn million and cdn million  respectively 
coreworx has recently begun to restructure its operations in order to become cash flow neutral 
we expect that coreworx may continue to require additional working capital support in order to effectuate its revised plan and finance its operations in this support may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
we have no assurance that additional working such support will be available such sources in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from us may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
the current economic conditions and credit crisis may result in deferral of projects by our customers 
the current economic conditions and limited availability of credit may affect capital projects and budgets of coreworx customers 
this may result in deferral of projects  which would have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve planned sales 
specifically  oil and gas and mining mcps are sensitive to the market prices of oil and minerals  and decreases in the prices of oil and mineral commodities have caused some mcps in these sectors to be delayed indefinitely 
if we are not able to attract and retain top employees  our ability to compete may be harmed 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm our business 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
our success is also highly dependent on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train  retain and motivate highly qualified management  technical  sales and marketing personnel 
in particular  the recruitment of top research developers and experienced salespeople is critical to our success 
competition for such people is intense  substantial and continuous  and we may not be able to attract  integrate or retain highly qualified technical  sales or managerial personnel in the future 
in addition  in our effort to attract and retain critical personnel  we may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices for our products or services 
current and future competitors could have a significant impact on our ability to generate future revenue and profits the market for project management collaboration software is highly competitive 
coreworx competes with products such as open text s open text  emc s documentum  autodesk s buzzsaw  ibm s filenet and microsoft s sharepoint 
we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future as the pace of technological change and adaptation quickens and as additional companies enter into each of our markets 
numerous releases of competitive products have occurred recently and may be expected to continue in the near future 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current competitors and potential entrants into our marketplace 
we could lose market share if our current or prospective competitors introduce new competitive products  add new functionality to existing products  acquire competitive products  reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies 
if other businesses were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products  or if the dynamics in our marketplace resulted in increasing bargaining power by the consumers of our products and services  we would need to lower the prices we charge for the products we offer 
this could result in lower revenues or reduced margins  either of which may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
our products and services may not gain market acceptance or competitors may introduce offerings that surpass those of coreworx 
coreworx has assembled what it believes to be a unique suite of products along with an aggressive product marketing strategy that will be the basis of driving future revenue growth 
we intend to pursue our strategy of growing the capabilities of our software offerings through our proprietary research and the development of new product offerings 
the primary market for our software and services is rapidly evolving which means that the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release by the marketplace is not certain 
if the markets for our products and services fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become subject to intense competition  our business will suffer 
as a result  we may be unable to i successfully market our current products and services  ii develop new software products  services and enhancements to current products and services  iii complete customer installations on a timely basis  or iv complete products and services currently under development 
if our products and services are not accepted by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace  our business and operating results will be materially affected 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that coreworx will be successful in deriving significant revenue growth through its current strategy and marketing initiatives 
our investment in our current research and development efforts may not be effective 
the development of software products is a costly  complex and time consuming process  and the investment in software product development often involves a long gestation period until a return is achieved on such an investment 
we make and will continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities 
investments in new technology and processes are inherently speculative 
commercial success depends on many factors including the degree of innovation of the products developed through our research and development efforts  sufficient support from our strategic partners  and effective distribution and marketing 
accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development 
these expenditures may adversely affect our operating results if they are not offset by revenue increases 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts in order to maintain our competitive position 
however  significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years  if at all 
moreover  new products and services may not be profitable  and even if they are profitable  operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced for our current or historical products and services 
the demand for our products depends in large part on continued growth in the industries into which they are sold 
a market decline in any of these industries could have a material negative impact on our results of operations 
our growth is dependent  in part  on capital projects initiated by our customers and potential customers 
any industry downturns that adversely affect our customers or their customers  including increases in bankruptcies in relevant industries  could adversely affect end user demand for our customers products  which would adversely affect demand for our products 
growth in demand in the markets we serve has in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels of our current and potential customers  consumer spending  energy and commodity prices  and general economic conditions 
the rate  or extent to which  the industries we serve will grow  if at all  is uncertain 
the industries we serve are currently experiencing a decline in general economic conditions  which could result in slower growth or a decline in demand for our products  which could have a material negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the canadian dollar significantly strengthens relative to the us dollar  future operating results will be negatively affected 
coreworx currently derives approximately of its revenue in us dollars and a significant portion in australian dollars 
at the same time  most of coreworx s expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
a decline in the value of the us dollar will have a major impact on coreworx s profitability as it increases coreworx s costs in us dollars 
while coreworx has in the past been successful in reducing the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate through currency management  there is no assurance that coreworx will be able to successfully manage these exposures in the future 
any significant change in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our revenue  earnings and other financial measures 
revenue from the renewal of maintenance contracts on our older software sales may decline 
coreworx has historically enjoyed a high retention rate across its various product lines 
as coreworx s products age  these retention rates may not be sustained unless coreworx is successful in providing its customers with more advanced functionality and the levels of support that they require 
the loss of licenses to use or sell third party software or the lack of support or enhancement of such software could adversely affect coreworx s business 
coreworx depends on the sale and support of third party software for a significant component of its primary software product 
there can be no assurance that these third party products will be available on commercially reasonable terms or that they will be appropriately supported  maintained or enhanced by the licensors 
while coreworx would make its best efforts to mitigate the impact of the loss of the ability to use  sell and support third party software  there is no assurance that coreworx would be successful or that the terms for their use will remain economically feasible 
the inability to use the third party software could have a material adverse affect on our business 
the loss of one or more of our significant customers or a decline in demand from one or more of these customers could have a material negative impact on net sales 
in  of coreworx s revenue was the result of sales to four customers 
in addition  in any given quarter  license sales from individual transactions can be material and in some cases the related sales cycles can be long 
as a result  coreworx s revenue  cash flows and earnings can fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter due to the timing of significant license agreements 
the loss or a decline in demand from one or more of these customers could have a material negative impact on coreworx s results of operations and revenues  cash flows and earnings 
our future revenues depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new products 
coreworx needs to continue to upgrade the coreworx suite to add features demanded by the market 
coreworx is in the process of completing and enhancing the integration of the coreworx suite with microsoft sharepoint  a widely used collaboration tool and expects to complete the integration by the end of a failure to complete integration on a timely basis would have a negative impact on coreworx s sales  particularly to potential new customers 
coreworx s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products  to keep pace with technological developments and respond to end user requirements 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in developing or marketing new products or product enhancements  or that we can avoid significant delays in development in the future  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to continue to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically competent research and development staff and adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry  including providing for the continued compatibility of our software products with evolving computer hardware and software platforms and operating environments 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
our products may contain defects that could harm our reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues  and expose us to warranty claims and litigation 
our products are highly complex and sophisticated and  from time to time  may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors may be found in new software products or improvements to existing products after commencement of shipments to our customers 
if these defects are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct such errors in a timely manner 
in addition  despite the extensive tests we conduct on all our products  we may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which our products will operate and  as a result  we may be unable to adequately detect the design defects or software errors which may become apparent only after the products are installed in an end user s network 
the occurrence of errors and failures in our products could result in the delay or the denial of market acceptance of our products  alleviating such errors and failures may require us to make significant expenditure of our resources 
the harm to our reputation resulting from product errors and failures may be materially damaging 
since we regularly provide a warranty with our products  the financial impact of fulfilling warranty obligations may be significant in the future 
our agreements with our strategic partners and end users typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims 
these agreements usually contain terms such as the exclusion of all implied warranties and the limitation of the availability of consequential or incidental damages 
however  such provisions may not effectively protect us against claims and the attendant liabilities and costs associated with such claims 
although we maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage  such coverage may not be adequate to cover all such claims 
accordingly  any such claim could negatively affect our financial condition 
the sales cycle for our products is long which may result in significant fluctuations in license revenue being recognized from quarter to quarter 
the decision by a customer to purchase our products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across our customers network or networks 
as a result  licenses of these products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers  accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant expenditures and lengthy sales cycle and implementation procedures 
given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization to implement our software  our sales cycle may be longer compared to companies in other industries 
it may in some cases take several months  or even several quarters  for marketing opportunities to materialize into sales 
if a customer s decision to license our software is delayed or if the installation of our products takes longer than originally anticipated  the date on which we may recognize revenue from these licenses would be delayed 
such delays could cause volatility in our reported revenues from period to period 
risks related to our securities our stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
during our common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
fluctuations in our stock price may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continued volatility in the energy industry and the general economy  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of changes in our senior management  the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets  changes in accounting rules  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of energy related companies have been and remain volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
our share price may decline due to the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market including shares underlying warrants and options 
a substantial number of shares of our common stock are  or could upon exercise of options or warrants  become eligible for sale in the public market as described below 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the possibility of these sales  may adversely affect our stock price 
as of december    shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding 
as of december  we had  warrants outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of and  options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of per share  which if exercised for cash would result in the issuance of an additional  shares of common stock

item legal proceedings lawsuit filed by scr tech against evonik energy services  llc and others in august  scr tech filed suit the evonik lawsuit in superior court  mecklenburg county  north carolina against evonik llc  evonik energy services gmbh  evonik steag gmbh  evonik industries ag  hans ulrich hartenstein and brigitte hartenstein collectively  the evonik defendants 
evonik energy services gmbh is the immediate parent of evonik llc and is a subsidiary of evonik steag gmbh 
evonik steag gmbh is a subsidiary of evonik ag 
evonik energy services gmbh  evonik steag gmbh  and evonik industries ag are collectively hereinafter sometimes referred to as the evonik german entities 
hans ulrich hartenstein h 
hartenstein is the president of evonik llc  and brigitte hartenstein b 
hartenstein is the chief financial officer of evonik llc 
prior to joining evonik llc h 
hartenstein served as president of scr tech and b 
hartenstein served as chief financial officer of scr tech 
in connection with settlement of a dispute unrelated to the current lawsuit  h 
hartenstein and b 
hartenstein entered into a confidentiality and invention assignment agreement with scr tech the confidentiality agreement effective december  under the confidentiality agreement  h 
hartenstein and b 
hartenstein agreed to keep confidential  not to use and not to disclose any confidential information of scr tech 
once employed by evonik llc  h 
hartenstein and b 
hartenstein were directly involved with evonik llc s construction of an scr regeneration facility at evonik llc s kings mountain location 
scr tech has information and belief that the evonik german entities were aware of h 
hartenstein s and b 
hartenstein s involvement in construction of evonik s scr regeneration facility 
in the lawsuit  scr tech has alleged that h 
hartenstein and b 
hartenstein materially breached the confidentiality agreement  evonik llc tortiously interfered with the contractual obligations of h 
hartenstein and b 
hartenstein under the confidentiality agreement  the evonik defendants misappropriated scr tech s catalyst regeneration trade secrets  h 
hartenstein and b 
hartenstein impermissibly disclosed scr tech s trade secrets and evonik llc impermissibly acquired  disclosed or used scr tech s catalyst regeneration trade secrets 
the suit also alleges that h 
hartenstein and b 
hartenstein as former officers of scr tech breached their fiduciary duties to scr tech by misappropriating and using scr tech s proprietary information and other confidential assets to the detriment of scr tech  that h 
hartenstein and b 
hartenstein while officers of scr tech took steps to exploit their knowledge of scr tech s trade secrets and usurped scr tech s opportunity vis vis evonik llc for their own benefit  and that the evonik defendants engaged in unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of north carolina s deceptive trade laws 
scr tech has requested damages against each of the evonik defendants in an amount in excess of  to be determined at the time of trial plus interest  costs and attorney fees 
evonik llc filed an answer and counterclaim against scr tech in october  as of march   no answer has been filed by the other evonik defendants 
in its answer  evonik llc denies any liability to scr tech and has denied wrong doing 
evonik llc has alleged in its answer that scr tech s claims are barred because of the doctrines of estoppel and waiver  equitable doctrine of unclean hands  equitable doctrine of laches  and the relevant statutes of limitation 
further  evonik llc has alleged that scr tech lacks standing to bring any claim for misappropriation of trade secrets because scr tech did not own any trade secrets or other intellectual property with regard to scr regeneration process  and evonik llc further alleges that scr tech cannot establish any trade secret under north carolina law and scr tech has failed to identify the existence of any trade secret with sufficient particularity 
evonik llc s answer contains counterclaims against scr tech to the effect that scr tech defamed evonik llc  and as a result of such defamation evonik llc s standing  business goodwill and reputation have been damaged 
evonik llc has further counterclaimed that scr tech s lawsuit was filed to gain an unfair competitive advantage over evonik llc and scr tech s actions relative to the lawsuit constitute unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of north carolina law 
in connection with such counterclaims  evonik llc alleges that it has been damaged in each case in an amount in excess of  and that in the case of unfair and deceptive conduct and actions it is entitled to treble damages in addition to its costs  interest and reasonable attorney fees 
further  evonik llc has requested that it be awarded punitive damages to be determined at trial 
we believe the counter claims to be without merit 
the evonik german entities have objected to being named parties in the lawsuit  and have filed a motion to be dismissed from the lawsuit based upon their argument that the north carolina court lacks jurisdiction and they are not proper parties to the lawsuit 
the evonik lawsuit is in the early stages of litigation  and discovery has not yet commenced 
the issues involved in the lawsuit are complex  and we anticipate that the expenses relating to the lawsuit eg legal fees  expert witness fees  discovery costs  travel expenses  etc 
will be costly 
due to the complexity of the matters involved in the lawsuit and the fact that some of the defendants are located in germany  it is not possible to predict the length of time it will take for the lawsuit to be resolved either by settlement or trial 
as of march   no meaningful settlement talks have occurred nor have any been scheduled 
the lawsuit will involve time and attention of senior management of scr tech  and could divert the attention of senior management from other business matters 
expenses of the lawsuit may cause a diversion of significant funds needed by scr tech to fund operations for other aspects of the business 
due to the nature of litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the lawsuit 
we anticipate that the evonik defendants will vigorously defend themselves  and that evonik llc will vigorously pursue its counterclaims against scr tech 
in the event scr tech is unsuccessful in the lawsuit and evonik llc prevails in its counterclaims  evonik llc may be awarded substantial damages against scr tech  and scr tech has not reserved funds for such contingency or legal fees associated with this litigation 
in addition  if scr tech is unsuccessful  evonik llc will remain a competitor of scr tech

in its complaint  ees has alleged that coalogix improperly acquired knowledge of ifs c through its dealings with ees in connection with the letter of intent  coalogix tortiously interfered with ees s business relationship with solucorp  coalogix engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices  and solucorp s license of ifs c to coalogix is invalid 
ees s complaint requests that all of coalogix s revenues relating to ifs c ie 
metallifix be awarded to ees  and ees has also requested unspecified damages together with attorney fees  court costs and interest be assessed against coalogix and awarded to ees 
coalogix filed its answer to ees complaint 
coalogix denies liability to ees and contends that ees allegations are without merit 
the matter is in the initial discovery stage 
coalogix intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit by ees 
no settlement discussions or mediation have yet occurred 
although coalogix believes that ees allegations are without merit  there is no way to predict the outcome of this lawsuit 
in the event ees is successful  coalogix could be liable to ees for substantial damages  interest and ees costs and attorneys fees 
coalogix s license agreement with solucorp provides that solucorp will indemnify coalogix for any loss  cost or expense incurred by coalogix in connection with solucorp s agreement with ees relating to ifs c 
coalogix expects solucorp to reimburse coalogix for its expenses  including attorneys fees relating to the ees case 
in addition  should ees prevail  coalogix expects solucorp to indemnify it for any loss  cost or expense sustained in the lawsuit 
solucorp is a small company with limited revenues  and there can be no assurance that solucorp will have the financial ability to indemnify coalogix for any loss  cost or expense which may be ultimately incurred by coalogix including  but not limited to  reimbursement of attorneys fees

with this decision  camr is no longer effective 
camr was the federal government s attempt to reduce mercury emissions from coal fueled power plants  and with the vacature of camr there is no current federal regulation directly addressing reduction of mercury emissions from coal fueled power plants 
the epa is expected to promulgate new regulations restricting mercury emissions  however  there is no way to predict when such new regulations will be promulgated or effective 
the lack of federal regulations restricting mercury emissions could cause a delay for the demand for metallifix by utilities  and could have a negative impact upon coalogix s marketing and sales of metallifix 
gridsense on february   a majority of the shareholders approved a plan to make gridsense a private company by gridsense transferring its grid monitoring business to a newly formed australian corporation that will be owned by certain of the significant shareholders of gridsense including acorn energy 
under the plan  the debt of c   owed by gridsense will be continue to be owed by gridsense s australian operating subsidiary 
our percentage ownership of the newly formed australian corporation once gridsense has gone private is expected to be approximately 
the going private transaction is expected to be effective in the second quarter of dsit in february  dsit received a million order for its aquashield underwater security system 
the system will be used for the protection of a large energy facility at an undisclosed location in asia 
the system will include multiple aquashield diver detection sonar dds units  which will be combined and integrated into a comprehensive surveillance system 
the system will guard and protect the customer infrastructure from underwater intrusion and sabotage 
this order follows million order for another aquashield underwater security system in january plus another million of other project orders for its other naval rt solutions 
the addition of these orders increased dsit s backlog from million at december  to million 
comverge the market value of our  common shares of comverge on december  was approximately million based on a market share price of on that date 
since december   through march  we have sold  of our common shares of comverge and received proceeds of approximately million 
the value of our remaining  shares of comverge s common shares as of march   is approximately million based on a market share price of corporate during the period from january  to march   we continued to make purchases of our common stock and acquired an additional  shares for approximately  overview and trend information the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed in item business risk factors which may affect future results 
we operate in three reportable segments coalogix  naval and rt solutions and eis 
we acquired our interest in coreworx which comprises our eis segment on august   our results for include coreworx s results only for the period following the date of acquisition 
coalogix was acquired on november   our results for include coalogix s results only for the period following the date of acquisition 
the following analysis should be read together with the segment information provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
coalogix scr tech metallifix coalogix sales in were million compared to sales of million of which we recorded only million since we recorded coalogix sales only since our acquisition of scr tech on november  
the increase in coalogix s sales in compared to is due to increased penetration in the growing regeneration market 
in addition  coalogix increased its production capacity in the fourth quarter of with the completion of a plant expansion 
coalogix increased its sales from the million recorded in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of the increase in sales was attributable largely to increased production volume facilitated by the plant expansion and to seasonal factors since power plants typically do not schedule service of the catalyst systems during the spring and summer ozone months 
coalogix gross profit in was million compared to gross profit of million of which we recorded only million since we recorded coalogix gross profit only since our acquisition of scr tech on november  
in increase in coalogix gross profit in was attributable to the increase in sales combined with increased efficiencies in our production 
coalogix gross profit in the fourth quarter of was million representing a million increase over the negative gross loss of million recorded by coalogix in the third quarter of the increase in coalogix gross profit was attributable to the significant increase in fourth quarter sales an increase of million combined with third quarter gross profit being suppressed due to seasonal factors since power plants typically do not schedule service of the catalyst systems during the spring and summer ozone months 
coalogix also completed some projects during the third quarter with negative margins caused by longer than expected times to complete these projects and by higher costs of the raw materials due to the product mix 
in march  enertech capital iii  a strategic investor  acquired a interest in coalogix 
we currently own of coalogix following enertech s investment 
in december  coalogix completed an expansion to its scr tech regeneration facility in charlotte  nc 
the expansion increased the overall efficiency of the facility and more than doubled its throughput capacity 
this expansion will enable scr tech to meet the growing demands of the catalyst and catalyst regeneration markets 
on january   phase i of the clean air interstate rule cair went into effect 
this is designed to permanently cap and achieve substantial reductions in emissions of nox across eastern states and the district of columbia  which we believe will further increase the size of our addressable market 
in  we expect coalogix to improve on its results based upon on its year end backlog for scr services of million and anticipated new orders  and the expected introduction of metallifix for mercury removal for coal fired power generation plants 
we expect that coalogix will need to expand its production capabilities in in order to accommodate anticipated growth in demand 
dsit solutions sales of our dsit subsidiary increased by million  or  from million in to million in due to a million increase in sales for the naval rt solutions segment 
the increase resulted from the recording of a full year s sales in on a three year project for a sonar and acoustic system for the israeli ministry of defense received in the middle of combined with increased sales from dsit s other real time and embedded solutions projects 
fourth quarter sales for dsit were million reflecting a million decrease from third quarter sales of million 
gross profit in dsit in was million which reflects an increase of million or from million in dsit s gross profit of million during the fourth quarter of represented a million increase over dsit s third quarter gross profit despite a million decrease in sales 
the increase in gross profit was attributable to a high margin project commenced by dsit in the fourth quarter of dsit s improved its gross margin to in as compared to in dsit s increased gross margins were due to higher margin projects being performed during the as compared to naval rt solutions during  and  sales from our naval rt solutions in our dsit subsidiary were million  million and million  respectively  accounting for approximately  and of dsit s consolidated sales for  and  respectively 
the balance of dsit s sales of million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively  were derived from dsit s other it and consulting activities 
consolidated segment revenues increased by million or in as compared to the increase in sales was the result of the acquisition of three significant naval projects in and a nis million approximately million at december  three year project for a sonar and underwater acoustic system for the israeli ministry of defense  and an order to supply our aquashield diver detection sonar dds system to protect a european oil terminal  which according to jane s international defence review is believed to mark the first commercial sale of a diver detection device to protect a critical coastal energy installation 
a fourth quarter sale of aquashield dds system to an undisclosed emea government 
two of these projects began in mid and our increased sales in are a direct result of our progress in those projects 
in addition to our increased sales from the abovementioned projects  we also recorded increased sales from our other real time and embedded solutions projects 
consolidated segment gross profit also increased from million in to million in as a result of the increased sales from our three significant projects and our other projects 
in addition  our gross profit margin increased from to from to due to higher gross margins recorded in our acoustic sonar solutions projects as compared to our real time and embedded solutions projects 
we anticipated continued growth in sales in we expect our sales growth to come primarily from our acoustic and sonar solutions projects with our embedded hardware and software development projects expected to remain relatively stable 
in the first three months of  we have already received million of new orders for our aquashield dds in addition to million for other projects 
dsit reached profitability in and we expect to be profitable as well 
coreworx coreworx  which we acquired on august   had sales in of cdn million compared to sales of cdn million 
the increase in coreworx s sales in compared to was principally due to new license sales to fluor and bhp billiton 
coreworx s gross profit in was cdn million compared to gross profit of cdn million 
the increase in coreworx s gross profit in was attributable to the increase in software license sales which attract higher margins than other category of sales 
software license sales increased by approximately in over coreworx increased its gross margin in to as compared to s 
coreworx s increased gross margin was due to a much stronger mix of license revenue compared to prior periods 
coreworx generally sells its software on a per seat license basis 
coreworx s profit margin depends upon the customer s requirements for a particular project and the resources coreworx has to devote to such project in addition to coreworx s general and administrative overhead 
during  coreworx delivered release of its software to its customers on time  and completed the architecture for integration of sharepoint 
coreworx also sold a gold license to its software to and renegotiated a favorable maintenance and support agreement with fluor 
coreworx has observed that the latin american economy has been less adversely affected by the global economic downturn than have other parts of the world  and believes there are opportunities to market and sell its software in latin america 
therefore  coreworx will begin a marketing campaign to o os and e cs with mcps located in latin america in to accelerate this initiative and mitigate the risk  coreworx will take advantage of hiring key personnel who until recently worked for a competitor in this region who have recently become available as a result of oracles acquisition of primavera 
additionally  coreworx intends to establish a value added reseller var network in order to manage this region 
in  we expect coreworx to improve on its results based upon its year end backlog of cdn million  anticipation of new sales  the addition of proexecute and expansion to latin america 
corporate at the end of  we began an effort to streamline our corporate costs 
towards that end  we have taken several steps in order to conserve our corporate cash including hiring in house counsel  reducing personnel  consulting and marketing costs 
we continue to have significant corporate expenses and will continue to expend in the future  significant amounts of funds on professional fees and other costs in connection with our strategy to seek out and invest in companies that fit our target business model 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies represents our attempt to report on those accounting policies  which we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosure 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies affecting our company principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies  investments in marketable securities  revenue recognition  foreign currency transactions  stock based compensation and impairments in goodwill and intangible assets 
principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
minority interests in net losses are limited to the extent of their equity capital 
losses in excess of minority interest equity capital are charged against us in our consolidated statements of operations 
investments in other entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and or our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
investments of this nature are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of the investee s net income or losses after the date of investment 
when net losses from an investment accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount  the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional losses are not recorded 
we resume accounting for the investment under the equity method when the entity subsequently reports net income and our share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended 
investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
during  wrote down our investments in paketeria  gridsense and enertech by a total of approximately million 
investments in marketable securities we account for our investments in equity securities under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fas 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are accounted for at their fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported as other comprehensive income loss  respectively 
under fas  unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported net of the related tax effect in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
as of december   the  comverge shares we held can be considered available for sale under sfas accordingly  we recorded our investment in comverge based on comverge s share price of at december  and recorded a decrease of  to our investment balance by recording those shares at fair market value to accumulated other comprehensive income with respect to the recording those shares at fair market value 
revenue recognition in the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of revenues representing approximately of our consolidated revenues in our coalogix subsidiary 
revenues related to scr catalyst regeneration and cleaning services are recognized when the service is completed for each catalyst module 
customer acceptance is not required for regeneration and cleaning services in that coalogix s contracts currently provide that services are completed upon receipt of testing by independent third parties confirming compliance with contract requirements 
from time to time  coalogix purchases spent catalyst modules  regenerates them and subsequently sells them to customers as refurbished units 
in such cases  revenues are not recognized until the units are delivered to the customer 
costs associated with performing scr catalyst regeneration and cleaning services are expensed as incurred because of the close correlation between the costs incurred  the extent of performance achieved and the revenue recognized 
in the situation where revenue is deferred due to collectibility uncertainties  coalogix does not defer costs due to the uncertainties related to payment for such services 
in the situation where revenue is deferred due to the non completion of regeneration services  the company defers the related costs as deferred costs 
revenue from time and materials service contracts  maintenance agreements and other services is recognized as services are provided 
in the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of revenues representing approximately of our consolidated revenues in our dsit subsidiary 
in  dsit derived approximately million or of dsit s revenues from fixed price type contracts 
fixed price type contracts require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized for a particular period  using the percentage of completion method as costs primarily direct labor are incurred  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future revenue and consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected and losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting changes in revenues and reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
at coreworx  we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenues recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  sop  modification of  software recognition with respect to certain transactions and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenues recognition in financial statements  issued by the sec 
coreworx s revenues of approximately million since its acquisition by us represents approximately of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable 
our application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue on delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element 
in accordance with sop  as amended  revenues derived from multiple element software sale arrangements are recognized in earnings based on the relative fair values of the individual elements 
our multiple element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support pcs are sold together 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered pcs element based on the contracted price for renewal pcs included in the original multiple element sales arrangement  as substantiated by contractual terms and our pcs renewal experience 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
if the revenue recognition criteria above are not satisfied  amounts received from customers are classified as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until such time as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
foreign currency transactions the currency of the primary economic environment in which our corporate headquarters and our us subsidiaries operate is the united states dollar dollar 
accordingly  the company and all of its us subsidiaries use the dollar as their functional currency 
coreworx s  functional currency is the canadian dollar cdn and dsit s functional currency is the new israeli shekel nis 
in the year ended december   of our revenues and in the years ended december  and  respectively came from our dsit subsidiary while of our revenue in the year ended december  came from our coreworx subsidiary 
their financial statements have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statements of operations amounts have been translated using the exchange rate at date of transaction 
all exchange gains and losses denominated in non functional currencies are reflected in finance expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations when they arise 
stock based compensation effective january   we have accounted for share based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r  during the years ended december   and  we recognized expense related to share options issued prior to but unvested as of january  as well as expense related to share options issued subsequent to january  the fair values of all stock options granted were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions such as risk free interest rates  volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock and the weighted average expected option life 
the expected volatility factor used to value stock options in was based on the historical volatility of the market price of the company s common stock over a period equal to the estimated weighted average life of the options 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab to amend the sec s views discussed in staff accounting bulletin sab regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with sab  as amended by sab for expected option life  we have what sab defines as plain vanilla stock options  and therefore used a simple average of the vesting period and the contractual term for options as permitted by sab the risk free interest rate used is based upon us treasury yields for a period consistent with the expected term of the options 
historically  we have not paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  accordingly  our expected dividend rate is zero 
we recognize this expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
due to the numerous assumptions involved in calculating share based compensation expense  the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from the value realized by employees on exercise of the share based instruments 
in accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas r  we do not adjust our recognized compensation expense to reflect these differences 
recognition of share based compensation expense had  and will likely continue to have  a material affect on our general and administrative line items within our consolidated statements of operations and also may have a material affect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred stock compensation expense of approximately  million and million  respectively 
the expense includes stock compensation expense recorded with respect to stock option grants in our coalogix and coreworx subsidiaries of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the impact of our adoption of sfas r and the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of share based employee compensation 
we account for stock based compensation issued to non employees on a fair value basis in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and related interpretations 
business combination accounting we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of our amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from seven to sixteen years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
in  as a result of our acquisition of coreworx and the subsequent cost allocation  we recorded an immediate expense of approximately million associated with acquired in process research and development 
in addition approximately million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets and approximately million to goodwill 
goodwill as a result of our various acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill 
our goodwill at december  was approximately million 
our goodwill is allocated to our segments as follows coalogix approximately million  naval rt solutions approximately million and eis approximately million 
we record goodwill when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we determine whether the carrying value of recorded goodwill is impaired on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the first step of the impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to the carrying value of that reporting unit 
the second step measures the amount of impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units 
fair values are determined either by using a discounted cash flow methodology or by using a combination of a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows  assumed discount rates and other assumptions as deemed appropriate 
we consider factors such as historical performance  anticipated market conditions  operating expense trends and capital expenditure requirements 
additionally  the discounted cash flows analysis takes into consideration cash expenditures for further product development 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter 
we determined that none of our reporting units were impaired as a result of our annual tests in results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of our total sales year ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses acquired in process research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses impairments operating loss finance expense  net gain on early redemption of convertible debentures gain on sale of shares in comverge gain on ipo of comverge gain loss on private placement of equity investments other income  net income loss from operations before taxes on income income tax benefit expense income loss from operations of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries share of losses in paketeria share of losses in gridsense share of losses in comverge minority interests  net of tax income loss from continuing operations gain loss on sale of discontinued operations and contract settlement in  net of income taxes income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income loss the following table sets forth certain information with respect to revenues and profits of our reportable business segments for the years ended december   and  including the percentages of revenues attributable to such segments

sales increased by million or to million in as compared to sales of million in of the increase in sales  million was attributable to sales from our coalogix segment which was included for the full year  but was included in only for the period from acquisition on november  to year end 
in addition  our sales also include million of sales by our recently acquired coreworx subsidiary whose results since our acquisition august  are included in our results for sales of our dsit subsidiary increased by million  or  from million in to million in due to a million increase in sales for the naval rt solutions segment 
the increase resulted from the recording of a full year s sales in on a three year project for a sonar and acoustic system for the israeli ministry of defense received in the middle of combined with increased sales from dsit s other real time and embedded solutions projects 
gross profit 
gross profits in increased by million or  to million from million in the increase in gross profits was attributable to the inclusion in of a full year of coalogix and the inclusion of coreworx from the date of its acquisition 
gross profit at coalogix and coreworx in was and million  respectively 
gross profit in dsit in was million which reflects an increase of million or from million in dsit s gross profit increase was due primarily to its increased sales noted above combined with improved margins

dsit s increased its gross margin to as compared to s while coalogix increased its gross margins to in from in in the period from our acquisition 
in addition  included coreworx s gross margins of  which were not included in results 
dsit s increased gross margins were due to higher margin projects being performed during the as compared to coalogix s increased gross margins were due to higher margin projects in and efficiencies from higher revenue combined with relatively marginal growth in costs 
acquired in process research and development expenses ipr d 
ipr d represents coreworx s research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use when acquired 
we have determined that approximately million of the purchase price of coreworx represents purchased in process technology and expensed this amount immediately upon acquisition 
research and development expenses r d 
r d expenses in increased by million as compared to the increase in r d expense was due to the inclusion in of coreworx r d expenses of approximately million 
this was partially offset by a decrease in r d expense at dsit

those gains were partially offset by our corporate expenses of approximately million  net finance expenses of approximately million  dsit losses of million and our share of losses in paketeria of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents not including current and non current restricted deposits of million of which we expect approximately million to be released in the second quarter of 
net cash used in the year ending december   was million  of which million was used in operating activities 
the primary use of cash in operating activities in was our corporate cash operating expenditures of approximately million which was offset by cash generated from operations of million each and dsit and coalogix 
cash used in investing activities were primarily due to our acquisition of coreworx million  million of loans made to paketeria  gridsense  coreworx in contemplation of our acquisition and others  million used for the acquisition of license technology by our coalogix subsidiary  million used for acquisitions of property and equipment  million used to fund our investment in gridsense and enertech  million deposited in an israeli bank as a guarantee for a project being performed by dsit and million of costs related to our november acquisition of scr tech

this use of cash was partially offset by the million investment made by enertech in coalogix and the million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants and employee stock options 
as of march   the company s corporate operations not including cash at any of our subsidiaries had a total of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents not including the million deposited in an account as a security for a guarantee for dsit  reflecting a million decrease from the balance as of december  we believe that the cash available and the cash potentially available from any of our assets will provide more than sufficient liquidity to finance acorn s activities for the foreseeable future and for the next months in particular 
at december   dsit had approximately  in israeli credit lines available to dsit by an israeli bank   of which was then being used  net of secured deposits 
dsit s credit lines are available to it until march  are denominated in nis and bear interest at a weighted average rate of the israeli prime rate per annum plus at december   plus 
the israeli prime rate fluctuates and as of december  was december   
the line of credit is subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
at december   dsit was in compliance with its financial covenants 
the company has a floating lien and provided guarantees with respect to dsit s outstanding lines of credit 
in addition  acorn has agreed to be supportive of dsit s liquidity requirements over the next months 
at the beginning of march  dsit was utilizing approximately of its line of credit 
we believe that dsit will have sufficient liquidity to finance its activities from cash flow from its own operations over the next months 
this is based on continued utilization of its lines of credit and expected continued improvement of operating results stemming from anticipated growth in sales 
dsit is continuing to search for additional sources of financing to support its growth 
in october  coalogix signed an agreement with square bank for a  term loan and a million formula based line of credit 
the term loan is for a period of months and bears interest at prime plus 
the line of credit is for a period of one year and bears interest at prime plus 
both the term loan and the line of credit are to finance coalogix s working capital and to finance its growth and are subject to certain financial covenants 
we believe that coalogix will have sufficient liquidity to finance its operating activities from cash flow from its own operations and its bank financing over the next months 
coalogix anticipates that it will need to increase production capacity by beginning construction of a new plant in in order to satisfy expected increased orders from customers 
coalogix does not have the financial resources to finance the anticipated cost to build a new plant 
coalogix is currently exploring options to obtain funding for the construction of the new plant 
we expect that coreworx will require additional working capital support in order to finance its working capital needs in this support may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
there is no assurance that such support will be available from such sources in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from us in coreworx may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
contractual obligations and commitments the table below provides information concerning obligations under certain categories of our contractual obligations as of december  cash payments due to contractual obligations years ending december  in thousands total and thereafter notes payable enertech operating leases potential severance obligations to israeli employees total contractual cash obligations we expect to finance these contractual commitments in from cash currently on hand and cash generated from operations 
in august  we committed to invest up to million over a ten year period in enertech capital partners iii lp enertech iii  a proposed million venture capital fund targeting early and expansion stage energy and clean energy technology companies that can enhance the profits of the producers and consumers of energy 
the primary objective of enertech iii is to provide superior venture returns 
in so doing  enertech iii may also provide investors with venture portfolio diversification  a hedge against rising commodity fuel prices and access to emerging companies that reduce the global dependence on hydrocarbons 
our obligation under this commitment is presented as a current liability  though it is uncertain as to when actual payments may be made 
to date  we have received and funded a capital call of  to enertech iii 
under israeli law and labor agreements  dsit is required to make severance payments to dismissed employees and to employees leaving employment under certain other circumstances 
the obligation for severance pay benefits  as determined by the israeli severance pay law  is based upon length of service and last salary 
these obligations are substantially covered by regular deposits with recognized severance pay and pension funds and by the purchase of insurance policies 
as of december   we accrued a total of million for potential severance obligations of which approximately million was funded with cash to insurance companies 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements 
our dsit subsidiary has provided various performance  advance and tender guarantees as required in the normal course of its operations 
as at december   such guarantees totaled approximately million and were due to expire through as security for a portion of these guarantees  acorn has deposited with an israeli bank approximately million which is shown as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
the company expects a majority of the restricted cash to be released in the second quarter of impact of inflation and currency fluctuations in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on lines of credit incurred to finance our operations in israel  whose utilization at december  stood at approximately  our non us dollar monetary assets and liabilities net assets of approximately million at december  in israel are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates 
furthermore  million and million of our backlog of projects are contracts and orders that are denominated in nis and linked to an israeli ministry of defense index  and denominated in nis  respectively 
historically  a majority of dsit s sales have been denominated in dollars or denominated in nis linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
in  we expect a significant portion of dsit s sales to be settled in dollars 
a significant majority of dsit s expenses in israel are in nis  while a portion is in dollars or dollar linked nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel may be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in the appreciation of the nis against the dollar was and in the appreciation of the nis against the dollar was 
inflation in israel was in and during during the first two months of  the dollar appreciated by against the nis and inflation during this period was 
in the first quarter of  dsit began to attempt to manage its foreign currency exposures by purchasing forward contracts on certain of its expected expenses 
as of december   virtually all of dsit s monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars or dollar linked nis were denominated in nis 
in the event that in the future we have material net monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations 
in addition  our non us dollar assets and liabilities net liability of approximately million at december  in canada at our coreworx subsidiary are also exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates 
the dollar cost of our operations in canada may also be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
in the appreciation of the us dollar against the canadian dollar was 
during the first two months of  the us dollar appreciated by against the canadian dollar 
as of december   virtually all of coreworx s assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars were denominated in canadian dollars 
in the event that in the future we have material net assets or liabilities that are not denominated in us dollars  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are required to make certain disclosures regarding our financial instruments  including derivatives  if any 
a financial instrument is defined as cash  evidence of an ownership interest in an entity  or a contract that imposes on one entity a contractual obligation either to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument to or from a second entity 
examples of financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable  loans  investments  trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  options and forward contracts 
the disclosures below include  among other matters  the nature and terms of derivative transactions  information about significant concentrations of credit risk  and the fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
foreign currency risk the translation of the balance sheets of our israeli operations from nis into us dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as is the of the balance sheets of our canadian operations from c into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded either as cumulative translation adjustments cta within stockholders equity  or foreign exchange gains or losses in the statement of operations 
in the nis strengthened in relation to the us dollar by 
in the period since our acquisition of coreworx  the us dollar strengthened in relation to the canadian dollar by 
to test the sensitivity of these operations to fluctuations in the exchange rate  the hypothetical change in cta and foreign exchange gains and losses is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non us operations by a change in the currency exchange rates 
as of december   a weakening of the us dollar against the nis and against the canadian dollar would have increased stockholders equity by approximately  arising from a cta adjustment of approximately  and net exchange gains of approximately 
these hypothetical changes are based on adjusting the december  exchange rates by 
in  dsit began to attempt to manage its foreign currency exposures by purchasing forward contracts on certain of its expected expenses 
coreworx does not employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging  to manage its foreign currency exchange rate exposures 
fair value of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are estimated to approximate their book values due to the short maturity of such investments 
fair value for long term debt and long term deposits are estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt and deposits with similar terms and remaining maturities 
the fair value of our long term debt and long term deposits are not materially different from their carrying amounts 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables 
the counterparty to a majority of our cash equivalent deposits is a money market of a major financial institution which invests only in us treasury bills 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by this counterparty 
approximately of the trade accounts receivable at december  was due from a customer that pays its trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base
