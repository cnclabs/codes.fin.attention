item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including item business  item a risk factors  item selected financial data  and item financial statements and supplementary data 
the various sections of this discussion contain a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing 
our actual results may differ materially 
overview we are engaged in the development  manufacture  sale and service of consumables and systems for genetic analysis in the life sciences and clinical healthcare markets 
there are a number of factors that influence the size and development of our industry  including the availability of genomic sequence data for human and other organisms  technological innovation that increases throughput and lowers the cost of genomic and genetic analysis  the development of new computational techniques to handle and analyze large amounts of genomic data  the availability of government and private funding for basic and disease related research  the amount of capital and ongoing expenditures allocated to research and development spending by biotechnology  pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies  the application of genomics to new areas including molecular diagnostics  agriculture  human identity and consumer goods  and the availability of genetic markers and signatures of diagnostic value 
we have established our genechip system as the platform of choice for acquiring  analyzing and managing complex genetic information 
our integrated genechip platform includes disposable dna probe arrays chips consisting of gene sequences set out in an ordered  high density pattern  certain reagents for use with the probe arrays  a scanner and other instruments used to process the probe arrays  and software to analyze and manage genomic information obtained from the probe arrays 
we currently sell our products directly to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrichemical  diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic research centers  government research laboratories  private foundation laboratories and clinical reference laboratories in north america and europe 
we also sell our products through life science supply specialists acting as authorized distributors in latin america  india  the middle east and asia pacific regions  including china 
the following overview describes two of the key elements of our business strategy and our goals increase top line revenue growth 
we intend to generate top line revenue growth through the successful commercialization of our technologies and expansion of our customer base  including leveraging our technologies into new markets and through the acquisition of other companies  products and technology 
we also believe that the genotyping market will continue to be one of the most attractive growth opportunities in life sciences and that new content packaged in versatile formats will drive growth for years to come 
these opportunities include emerging cytogenetic and copy number diagnostics and our new drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters dmet product which we believe addresses a significant unmet need for our pharmaceutical partners 
improve operating efficiency 
starting in february we implemented a restructuring plan in order to optimize our production capacity and cost structure to enable us to decrease our cost of manufacturing and operating expenses 
we intend to move by mid our probe array manufacturing to our singapore facility and our reagent manufacturing to our cleveland facility 
during we also terminated certain research and development programs and made reductions in selling  marketing  general and administrative areas 
in connection with these efforts  during we incurred total 
table of contents non cash charges of approximately million related to the abandonment of certain long lived assets and expenses of approximately million related to employee severance 
targeted acquisitions to expand our market opportunities 
in addition to continued innovation  we are also pursuing acquisitions to expand our market opportunities 
in  we completed three acquisitions 
the first was usb which is expected to accelerate next generation reagents that will be used with new products that we have in development 
the second was tmi which develops digitally encoded microparticle technology that is applicable to the research  applied  and diagnostic markets and is expected to enable us to enter low to mid multiplex markets 
the third was panomics which is expected to enable us to provide customers with a suite of assay products for a wide variety of low to mid plex genetic  protein and cellular analysis applications 
critical accounting policies estimates general the following section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into contracts to sell our products and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the value of the arrangement should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when and how to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and customer acceptance  if required  has occurred 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered to undelivered elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on any arrangement 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and  when we become aware of a specific 
table of contents customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record specific bad debt allowances to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record allowances for bad debt on a small portion of all other customer balances based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventories we enter into inventory purchases and commitments so that we can meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products 
the business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  product expiration and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods  when appropriate  in order to report inventory at net realizable value 
revisions to our inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand  component costs  supplier arrangements  or product life cycles differ from our estimates 
non marketable equity securities as part of our strategic efforts to gain access to potential new products and technologies  we invest in equity securities of certain private biotechnology companies 
our non marketable equity securities are carried at cost unless we determine that an impairment that is other than temporary has occurred  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we periodically review our investments for impairment  however  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment in identifying events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the analysis may include assessment of the investee s i revenue and earnings trend  ii business outlook for its products and technologies  iii liquidity position and the rate at which it is using its cash  and iv likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying value  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we have experienced impairments in our portfolio due to the decline in the value of certain of our non marketable investments over the past few years 
goodwill and acquired technology rights goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired arising from business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually  and on an interim basis if indicators of potential impairment exist 
as of december  and  goodwill related to the acquisition of neomorphic in october and the acquisition of parallele in october in  we made three acquisitions and recorded a total of million  net of additional goodwill 
as of december   we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis and determined that goodwill was impaired 
we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million  which included the goodwill amounts associated with its three acquisitions in  in the line labeled goodwill impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december  refer to note  goodwill and acquired technology rights  for further information 
acquired technology rights are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and are comprised of licenses to technology covered by patents held by third parties or acquired by the company 

table of contents amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of the underlying patents  which has historically ranged from one to thirteen years 
sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
as of december   we performed an impairment analysis or our identified intangible assets and as a result of that analysis  recognized an impairment loss on acquisition related intangible assets of million of which million was included as a component of cost of product sales  million was included as a component of research and development  and million was included as a component of selling  general and administration expenses in the consolidated statements of operations under during the year ended december  refer to note  goodwill and acquired technology rights  for further information 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill and other intangible assets  including acquired technology rights  is necessary involves significant judgment based on short term and long term projections of our operations 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and terminal growth rates  reflect our best estimates 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
in connection with the company s restructuring activities in  the company wrote down the value of certain of its property and equipment by approximately million which was included as a component of restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december  refer to note  restructuring  for further information 
income taxes income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we must assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
for example  in  we recorded an increase of million to our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and have placed a full valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets  net of fin reserves  as a result of negative evidence based on our cumulative net loss position 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable and that our reserves for income tax related uncertainties are adequate 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  future levels of research and development spending  nondeductible expenses  changes in overall levels  character  geographical mix of pretax earnings  and ultimate outcomes of income tax audits 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
the accounting treatment related to pre acquisition uncertain tax positions will change when sfas no 
r becomes effective  which will be in first quarter of our fiscal year see recent accounting pronouncements under summary of significant accounting policies included in the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for further discussion 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was approximately million 
if recognized  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact income tax expense is million 
as of december   we do not anticipate any material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit during the next months 
we classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as components of income tax expense 
for the year ended december   the amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties was approximately million for a total cumulative amount of million of non current income taxes payable as of december  we file us federal  state  and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and state tax authorities 
in significant foreign jurisdictions  the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
any reserves recorded may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for employee stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rates of the awards 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of historical and implied volatility of our common stock 
we determined that blended volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility 
the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
sfas r requires that employee stock based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period  or the vesting period  in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees 
accordingly  in  we recognized employee stock based compensation of million million in cost of product sales  million in research and development expense and million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we adopted sfas r on a modified prospective basis 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested employee stock awards not yet recognized is expected to be allocated to cost of products sales and operating expenses over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized under sfas r during the fiscal years prior to restructuring in recent years we engaged in  and may continue to engage in  restructuring actions  which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  lease cancellation  realizable values of assets that may become duplicative or obsolete  and other exit costs 
if the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements 
sfas is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands quarterly disclosure requirements in sfas no 
about an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued fsp determining fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active fsp 
fsp clarified the application of sfas no 
in an inactive market 
it demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r amends sfas and provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
it also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and will be applied prospectively 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
eitf defines collaborative arrangements and requires that transactions with third parties that do not participate in the arrangement be reported in the appropriate income statement line items pursuant to the guidance in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
income statement classification of payments made between participants of a collaborative arrangement are to be based on other applicable authoritative accounting literature 
if the payments are not within the scope or analogy of other authoritative accounting literature  a reasonable  rational and consistent accounting policy is to be elected 
eitf is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for defensive intangible assets eitf 
eitf addresses the accounting for assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition that an entity does not intend to actively use  otherwise referred to as a defensive asset 
eitf requires defensive intangible assets to be initially accounted for as a separate unit of accounting and not included as part of the cost of the acquirer s existing intangible asset s because it is separately identifiable 
eitf also requires that defensive intangible assets be assigned a useful life in accordance with paragraph of sfas we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december   and product sales the components of product sales are as follows in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from consumables instruments total product sales 
table of contents total product sales decreased million or in as compared to consumables sales decreased primarily due to a decline in volumes across most of the consumables product line  partially offset by higher consumables average selling prices due to mix shift to higher average selling priced products as well as higher reagents volumes associated with the acquisition of usb 
in addition  instrument sales declined primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of our probe array systems and genechip scanners 
total product sales increased million or in as compared to consumables increased primarily due to the consumables growth in unit sales 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average consumables selling price due to the implementation of our strategy to grow market share in the genotyping market 
instrument sales decreased primarily due to a decline of million because of a drop in the average selling price of our genechip scanner and a decrease of million primarily due to reduction in unit sale consumable sales for the years ended december   and include million  million and million  respectively  of revenue from perlegen sciences  inc perlegen  a related party 
services in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from services total services revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to a decrease of million in our genotyping services business because of the variable timing of projects  partially offset by an increase of million in instrument service revenue 
total services revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to a decrease of million in our genotyping services business  partially offset by an increase of million in instrument service revenue 
royalty and other revenue in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from royalties and other revenue royalties and other revenue increased in as compared to primarily due to a non recurring million intellectual property payment received in january  partially offset by higher license and grant revenue recognized in in january  under the terms of an expanded collaboration agreement  roche paid us an access fee of million  which we recognized as a component of product related revenue in license fees over the research and development period of approximately five years 
the amortization of this access fee was completed in our royalties and other revenues are primarily dependent on the issuance of new licenses and other intellectual property payments  which may fluctuate 
for example  other than the million non recurring payment received in  we have been seeing an overall decrease in the revenues earned from licensing our technology and we expect that trend to continue in 
table of contents product and services gross margins in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar point change from total gross margin on product sales total gross margin on services product gross margin as a percentage of products sales service gross margin as a percentage of services the decrease in product gross margin in as compared to is primarily due to asset impairments and restructuring related to the closing of our west sacramento manufacturing facility  unfavorable factory utilization due to lower production volumes and a mix shift to lower margin instruments products 
these decreases were partially offset by favorable consumable average selling prices due to a mix shift to higher margin products 
gross margin on product sales for the years ended december   and includes million  million and million  respectively  of gross margin from perlegen 
the decrease in product gross margin in as compared to is primarily due to the following factors a decline in the average selling price for our consumables and instrumentation products as well as lower factory utilization from ramping up our singapore operations without corresponding volume growth 
the decrease in service gross margin in as compared to is primarily due to lower capacity utilization from the decrease in the genotyping services volume 
research and development expenses in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from research and development the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to higher headcount related expenses and increased spending for supplies and outside services 
also included in is an asset impairment charge of million 
the decrease in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a million decrease in supplies and purchased services due to cost cutting measures and re prioritization of projects  a million decrease in total compensation and benefits due to a reduction in headcount  and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from selling  general and administrative the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in bonus and sales incentive based payments plus lower stock option based expenses 

table of contents the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to cost cutting efforts including million of lower legal expenses  million of lower headcount related costs and million of lower stock based compensation expense 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in variable compensation due to our improved operating results 
acquired in process technology in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from acquired in process technology for each business acquisition  we determined the estimated fair value of certain research and development programs in process at the acquisition date that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use and recorded approximately million  million and million related to the acquisition of usb  tmi and panomics  respectively  in the line item acquired in process technology in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the fair values of these projects were determined using the income approach whereby we estimated each project s related future net cash flows 
this discount rate is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired 
the projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects of each acquired company considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product  the life of each potential commercialized product and the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing products and services based on complex genetic technologies and biochemical processes 
the largest research and development program in process at the acquisition date primarily was the microrna profiling project undertaken by tmi 
the fair value of this project was determined using the income approach whereby we estimated the project s related future net cash flows between and and discounted them to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate of approximately 
this discount rate is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the project acquired 
we expect to complete this project in fiscal the estimates used by us in valuing the licensed technologies and acquired in process technologies were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
restructuring in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from restructuring fiscal restructuring plan in february  we committed to a restructuring plan the plan designed primarily to optimize our production capacity and cost structure and improve our future gross margins 
the plan involves the closure of our west sacramento manufacturing facility after which all of our products will 
table of contents be manufactured at our singapore and ohio facilities  as well as by third parties 
we expect the closure of the west sacramento facility to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of we estimate the total restructuring expenses to be incurred in connection with the plan will be approximately million 
of this total  approximately million relates to employee severance and million relates to non cash charges associated with the abandonment and impairment of certain long lived manufacturing assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  the costs relating to employee severance and relocation are being recognized as expense over the remaining service periods of the employees 
the cash outlays to be incurred in connection with the plan are estimated to be approximately million 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of expense for employee termination benefits associated with the plan and million of non cash charges related to the abandonment and impairment of certain manufacturing assets 
these expenses are presented as a component of restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition to the million of restructuring costs noted above  we expect to incur a total of approximately million of restructuring related costs through the second quarter of to be included as a component of cost of product sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
of this total  million relates to accelerated depreciation charges associated with the continued use of certain long lived manufacturing assets and million relates to manufacturing transition and other costs 
fiscal restructuring plan in july  we announced that we were consolidating an administrative facility located in sunnyvale  california into our main campus in santa clara  california the plan 
additionally  in august and december  we terminated certain employees in the research and development and selling  general and administrative functions 
the sunnyvale  california facility was vacated during the fourth quarter of the estimated cash outlays to be incurred in connection with these restructuring activities were approximately million 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million related to contract termination costs and employee termination benefits associated with the plan 
during the year ended december   the company recognized approximately million of expense primarily related to employee termination benefits and contract termination costs associated with the plan 

table of contents fiscal restructuring plan in  we initiated a restructuring plan the plan to better align certain of our expenses with our current business outlook 
our primary focus of the plan was in the general and administrative functions and included rationalizing our facilities 
cash outlays incurred in connection with these restructuring activities are estimated to be approximately million 
during the year ended december   the amount of expense recognized associated with the plan was not material 
during the years ended december  and  the company recognized approximately million and million of expense primarily related to employee termination benefits and contract termination costs associated with the plan  respectively 
goodwill impairment charges in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from goodwill impairment charges sfas requires that goodwill be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstance indicating the carrying value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  and negative industry or economic trends 
we performed our required annual impairment test in june and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
during the third quarter of  our stock price fell below our net book value per share 
the stock price decline  along with other conditions in our business such as decreases in our actual revenues as compared to our forecasted revenues and additional restructuring activities  are defined as indicators of impairment of goodwill and other intangibles under sfas accordingly  we were required to assess whether or not an impairment of our intangible assets  including goodwill  had occurred 
we performed an interim impairment assessment using a market based approach as of september  and determined that there was no impairment 
the continued decline of our stock price in the fourth quarter of and the resulting book value per share being in excess of market value per share  along with other conditions in our business as noted above  were indicators that it was more likely than not that our fair value was less than the carrying value 
we performed an interim impairment assessment using a market based approach as of december  and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was not recoverable and recorded an impairment charge of million which was presented as goodwill impairment charges in the company s consolidated statements of operations

 accounting for income taxes sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
as of december   we provided for a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets 
we have placed a full valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets  net of fin reserves  as a result of negative evidence 
table of contents based on our cumulative net loss position 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to assure realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income 
as of december   the company had total net operating loss carryforwards of million  comprised of million for us federal purposes  which expire in the years through if not utilized  and million for state purposes  the majority of which expire in the years through if not utilized 
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions

liquidity we have financed our operations primarily through product sales  sales of equity and debt securities  collaborative agreements  interest income  and licensing of our technology 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities of approximately million 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources along with the cash to be generated from operations will enable us to maintain currently planned operations  acquisitions and capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future 
capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately to million for the year ending december  however  this expectation is based on our current operating and financing plans  which are subject to change  and therefore we could require additional funding 
factors that may cause us to require additional funding may include future acquisitions  our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaboration and customer arrangements  the progress of our research and development programs  initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  the purchase of patent licenses  and other factors 
as of december   we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
our inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we may seek to retire  repurchase  or exchange our convertible securities in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions dependent on market conditions  liquidity  and contractual obligations and other factors

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands total after senior convertible notes interest on senior convertible notes operating leases purchase commitments total contractual obligations our senior convertible notes are due in however  holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on december     and in december  a total of million of our convertible debt was redeemed for cash as investors exercised their put right 
our senior convertible notes are due in  however  holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on january   and purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on affymetrix and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to

periods of maturity fair value at december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities senior convertible notes due average interest rate senior convertible notes due average interest rate periods of maturity fair value at december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities senior convertible notes due average interest rate senior convertible notes due average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk we derive a portion of our revenues in foreign currencies  predominantly in europe and japan 
in addition  a portion of our assets are held in nonfunctional currencies of our subsidiaries 
we conduct our hedging activities by using currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposures created from our activities denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging program is designed to reduce  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
prior to  we hedged a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward contracts and the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
our revenue hedging policy was designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
in  we did not carry or initiate new currency forward contracts on a percentage of forecasted international revenue  based on management s internal assessment of the risk posed by extrapolating historical and potential future currency rate changes 
management will continue to reevaluate this risk on an ongoing basis 
as of december   we had no open hedging contracts
