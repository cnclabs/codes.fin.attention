risk factors and under the caption factors which may influence future results of operations below 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
overview and background we are a provider of wireless broadband access solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market 
our broad range of products includes third generation  or g  wireless pc card and expresscard modems  embedded modems  usb and other fixed mobile convergence  or fmc  solutions and communications software for wireless network operators  infrastructure providers  distributors  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and vertical markets worldwide 
through the integration of our hardware and firmware  our products are designed to operate on a majority of the world s wireless networks and provide mobile subscribers with secure and convenient high speed access to corporate  public and personal information through the internet and enterprise networks 
we also offer firmware engineering  integration and design services to our customers to facilitate the use of our products 
our strong customer relationships provide us with the opportunity to expand our market reach and sales 
most of our sales to wireless operators and oems are sold directly through our sales force 
to a lesser degree  we also use an indirect sales distribution model through the use of select distributors 
we are continuing to drive widespread adoption of our products through increased global marketing activities  expansion of our distribution networks and continued leverage of our strategic relationships with wireless industry leaders 
we intend to continue to identify and respond to our customers needs by introducing new product designs with an emphasis on supporting cutting edge wide area network  or wan  technology  ease of use  performance  weight  cost and power consumption 
we manage our products through a structured life cycle process  from identifying initial customer requirements through development and commercial introduction to eventual phase out 
during product development  emphasis is placed on time to market  meeting industry standards and customer product specifications  ease of integration  cost reduction  manufacturability  quality and reliability 
we currently have agreements with lg innotek and inventec appliances corporation  or iac  for the outsourced manufacturing of our products 
under our manufacturing agreements  lg innotek and iac provide us with services including component procurement  product manufacturing  final assembly  testing  quality control  fulfillment and delivery 
in addition  we have an agreement with mobiltron for certain distribution  fulfillment and repair services related to our business in europe  the middle east and africa  or emea 
factors which may influence future results of operations we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into new customer contracts for the development and supply of our products 
this may place significant demands on our resources 
the continuing global financial crisis and the resulting slowdown in the worldwide economy is causing  and we expect may continue to cause  contraction in demand for our products 
in addition  the financial crisis may 
table of contents continue to have an impact on the value of our investment portfolio  foreign currency exchange gain loss  and net investment interest income loss 
we also believe that the current contraction in demand for our products in europe will substantially reduce our revenues from this region in the first quarter of  as compared to prior periods 
revenue 
we believe that our revenue growth will be influenced largely by the strength and breadth of the demand for wireless access to data through the use of next generation networks including demand for g products and g data access services  particularly in europe  north america and asia  customer acceptance for our new products that address these markets  and our ability to meet customer demand 
factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following economic environment and related market conditions  increased competition from other wireless data modem suppliers as well as suppliers of emerging devices that contain a wireless data access feature  demand for broadband access services and networks  use of the internet  rate of change to new products  loss of significant customers  including current laptop customers who transition to alternative embedded module platforms such as qualcomm s gobi platform  timing of deployment of g networks by carriers  decreased demand for ev do  hsdpa and hsupa products  and changes in technologies 
we anticipate introducing additional g products during we continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless and computing industry leaders like alcatel lucent  dell  qualcomm  sony  sprint pcs  verizon wireless  telefonica  and vodafone and software vendors 
our strategic relationships also include technology and marketing relationships with wireless operators  oem partners that integrate our products into other devices  distributors and leading hardware and software technology providers 
through these strategic relationships  we have been able to enhance our market penetration by leveraging the resources of our channel partners  including their access to distribution resources  increased sales opportunities and market opportunities 
cost of revenue 
we currently outsource our manufacturing operations to lg innotek and iac 
in addition  we currently outsource certain distribution  fulfillment and repair services related to our business in emea to mobiltron 
all costs associated with these manufacturers and mobiltron are included in our cost of revenue 
cost of revenue also includes warranty costs  amortization of intangible licenses  royalties based on a percentage of revenue  operations group expenses  costs related to outside services and costs related to inventory adjustments  including write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products  which is influenced by the factors discussed above 
during  and  we recorded inventory write downs of million  million and million  respectively  primarily due to the decrease in demand for the affected products 
operating costs and expenses 
many of our products target wireless operators and other customers in north america  europe  and asia 
we will likely develop new products to serve these markets  resulting in increased research and development expenses associated with such new product development 
we have in the past and expect to continue to incur these expenses in future periods prior to recognizing revenue from sales of these products 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 
year ended december  as a percent of revenue revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating costs and expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating costs and expenses operating income loss interest income  net other income expense  net income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to decreases in sales for our ev do products partially offset by an increase in our high speed packet access  or hspa  products 
the decrease in ev do product sales for the year ended december  compared to was approximately million  primarily due to lower unit shipments of our merlin express and pc cards  and ovation usb modems and the effects of a lower average sales prices for such products due to competitive pricing pressures and the slowdown of global economies 
our hspa product sales increased by approximately million during compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in unit shipments of our ovation usb modems and expedite embedded modules 
overall  ev do revenue  which consists primarily of north american products  represented approximately of revenue in compared to in while hsdpa hsupa products represented approximately of revenue in compared to in this trend of increasing hsdpa hsupa product sales as a percent of revenue is not expected to continue in the near term due to increased competitive pressures in the european market 
this revenue decline is expected to be offset by increased revenues from new embedded module product sales to a content delivery device customer 
however  we expect european sales to continue to be an important component of our total revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  as compared to million  or of revenue in the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in was primarily related to the rate of decrease in the average per unit selling prices for products exceeding the rate of decrease in the average per unit cost of revenues and other market driven factors 
cost of revenue included million of inventory write down to the lower of cost or market due to the effects of lower than expected demand for certain products  the effects of the falling valuation of the euro  and poor macro economic conditions 
in addition  we recorded impairment charges of approximately  related to technology licenses  production fixtures  and tooling equipment 
as more fully discussed in note in 
table of contents the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  management performed an impairment analysis of the assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  and concluded that certain assets were not fully recoverable and an impairment loss was recognized in the year ended december  the global economic crisis and related increased competitive pressures may continue to negatively impact the average sales prices of our products 
this may require us in future periods to record additional inventory write downs to reflect lower of cost or market adjustments and revalue certain assets that may become impaired 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  included a million benefit due to a change in the company s assessment of its contingent liability related to intellectual property claims 
based on developments to date  the company does not believe that it is probable that the company will incur a loss relating to these intellectual property claims 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  included share based compensation expense of approximately  compared to approximately  in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is expected to fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold  competitive pricing  new product introduction costs and other factors 
gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  as compared to million  or of revenue in the decrease was primarily attributable to the changes in revenue and cost of revenue as discussed above 
we currently believe that our gross margins can be sustained in the range of to of revenue in the near term based on the currently expected product and customer mix 
however  actual results may differ substantially if  among other reasons  the economic environment and market conditions deteriorate further 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue compared to million  or of revenue in this decrease in expenses reflected a decrease of million in consulting and outside service fees and the favorable impact of development cost reimbursements from a vendor totaling million 
this decline was partially offset by a million increase in payroll related expenditures for ongoing research and development activities 
research and development expenses in included share based compensation of approximately million  compared to approximately million in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to fluctuate in future quarters depending on the amount of revenue recognized  and potential variation in the costs associated with the development of the company s products  including the number and complexity of the products under development and the progress of the development activities with respect to those products 
however  we expect to maintain or increase our investment in research and development to continue to provide innovative products and services 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue in the reduction in expense was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million related to marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in included share based compensation of approximately million  compared to approximately million in while managing sales and marketing expenses relative to revenue  we expect to continue to make selected investments in sales and marketing as we introduce new products  market existing products  expand our distribution channels and focus on key customers around the world 
we currently believe that our sales and marketing expenses in the near term may trend higher as a percent of revenue as we introduce new products in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue in 
table of contents during the year  the company incurred approximately million in professional fees and expenses related to an internal review of the company s revenue cut off procedures  internal controls and accounting related to certain customer contracts 
general and administrative expenses in included share based compensation of million  compared to million in while we are closely monitoring and undertaking to control general and administrative costs  these costs will be negatively impacted by legal fees incurred by the company to defend claims described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
interest income expense 
interest income  net decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to a decrease in the average yields realized on our marketable securities and cash balances during the year  which resulted in lower income as compared to other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million  to  of expense compared to  of income in this decrease was primarily due to the foreign exchange losses on our euro denominated accounts receivable and cash balances 
income tax expense benefit 
we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately  for the year ended december   which represents an effective tax benefit rate of 
the difference between the federal and state statutory combined rate of and our effective tax rate for is primarily due to the impact of domestic and foreign tax credits for research and development expenses and the impact of accounting for share based compensation  for which certain share based awards are treated as permanent differences 
during  management evaluated our deferred tax valuation allowance and determined that the valuation allowance related to our us deferred tax assets should not be significantly revised 
approximately million of deferred tax valuation allowance relating to the company s canadian subsidiary was established based on the uncertainty associated with the canadian subsidiary s ability to utilize the increased deferred tax assets 
this determination was based on available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and recent financial operations 
this determination required significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and is consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  was million excluding the valuation allowance adjustment 
the tax expense for the year ended december  was million excluding the valuation allowance adjustment in in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  we recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share based awards granted under equity incentive compensation plans  including nonqualified stock options and restricted stock  but cannot recognize a tax benefit currently for those share based compensation expenses associated with incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares qualified stock options 
for qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognize a tax benefit in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur  and for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid in capital 
during  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million associated with share based compensation 
the impact of share based compensation permanent items resulted in a decrease of percentage points in our annual effective tax benefit rate 
because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock and because a portion of that tax benefit may be recorded directly to additional paid in capital  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to reasonably estimate our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is diminished 
net income loss 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  as compared to net income of approximately million in the decrease in net income was due to a decrease in revenue and overall profitability of the company as discussed above 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the overall increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our ev do  hsdpa  and hsupa products  which includes ev do and hsdpa expresscards and embedded modules  and ev do and hsupa fmc products 
the increase in ev do product sales for the year ended december  compared to was approximately million  mostly consisting of fmc usb modems 
our hsdpa hsupa product sales also increased by approximately million during compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in shipments of embedded modules and fmc usb modems 
overall  ev do revenue  which consists primarily of north american products  represented approximately of revenue in compared to in while hsdpa hsupa products represented approximately of revenue in compared to in the mix of revenue by technology is expected to continue to depend primarily upon  among other things  the geographic region of our sales efforts and demand by our customers 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million in the increase in cost of revenue was primarily related to an increase in product cost of million due to the increase in product sales 
in addition  freight and distribution costs increased by approximately million due to the additional volume of products shipped in compared to the remaining increase in cost of revenue primarily consists of an increase in royalty costs for intellectual property licenses of million  an increase in manufacturing overhead costs of approximately million  and an increase of approximately million related to depreciation expense of production equipment procured to increase manufacturing capacity compared to cost of revenue in included share based compensation of approximately  compared to approximately  in gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as discussed above 
gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the additional revenue that exceeded our fixed cost structure  and increased sales of higher margin ev do products in as compared to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in salary and related expenses due to increased headcount to support our new product development 
other increases consist of equipment and overhead costs of approximately  depreciation expenses of approximately  due to capital equipment purchases  an increase in outside consulting services of approximately  mainly related to product certification costs  and an increase of approximately  in travel and related expenses in compared to research and development expenses in included share based compensation of approximately million  compared to approximately million in sales and marketing expenses

general and administrative expenses in included share based compensation of million  compared to million in interest income expense 
interest income  net increased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to the increase in our average cash and marketable securities balances in  as well as an increase in the average yields realized on our marketable securities and cash balances  which resulted in higher income in other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december  decreased by approximately  or  to approximately  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in our foreign exchange gains on our euro denominated receivable and cash balances 
income tax expense benefit 
we recorded income tax expense of approximately million for the year ended december   which represents an effective tax rate of

net income 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million  as compared to net income of  in the increase in net income was due to the growth in revenue and overall profitability of the company as discussed above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations 
we do not currently have a revolving credit facility or similar loan agreement 
as of december   we had working capital of million and million in cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities  which is a decrease of million from million at december  the decrease is primarily related to the company s repurchase of million of our common stock during pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in march providing for the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock on the open market through september  the repurchase program 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of approximately million and recorded net income of million  as of december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million compared to an accumulated deficit of million at december  historical cash flows the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  end of year operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for compared to million for during  the million in cash provided by operations was primarily attributable to our net loss of approximately million being offset by non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization  charges for inventory losses  and share based compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities for was approximately million 
this was primarily attributable to our net income of approximately million  an increase in our accrued expenses and income taxes and of non cash share based compensation expense and depreciation expense offset by increases in our accounts receivable and inventory  and a non cash increase in deferred taxes 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for was approximately million compared to million provided by investing activities in the cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to purchases of property and equipment  offset by net sales of marketable securities 
the cash used by investing activities in was related to net purchases of marketable securities and net purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for net cash used in financing activities in was primarily related to the company s repurchase of million of its outstanding common stock on the open market pursuant to the repurchase program 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and share purchases from the company made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan  including related excess tax benefits  
table of contents were lower in compared to due to less stock option exercise activity 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily related to million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options and warrants  and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
the company also realized excess tax benefits of million from stock option exercises 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by fiscal year total operating leases capital leases committed purchase orders total contractual obligations our liability for uncertain tax benefits  including interest  as of december  was approximately million 
our tax liability for uncertain tax benefits is not included in our table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we do not believe that we will pay such amount within one year from december   however  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future payments with respect to this liability 
other liquidity needs the company expects to incur professional fees and expenses to defend litigation filed against the company or related to its products  which litigation is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these costs cannot be estimated at this time 
during the next twelve months we plan to incur approximately million to million for capital expenditures and the acquisition of additional licenses 
we believe that our available cash and investments  together with our operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund operations  including the further development of our new products and to satisfy our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
our future revenue is dependent on us fulfilling our commitments under agreements with a small number of major customers 
our liquidity could be impaired if there is any interruption in our business operations  a material failure to satisfy these contractual commitments or a failure to generate revenue from new or existing products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  provision for excess and obsolete inventory  valuation of intangible and long lived assets  provision for warranty costs  royalty costs  income taxes  foreign exchange forward contracts  and share based compensation expense 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from the sale of wireless modems to wireless operators  oems and distributors 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon the later of transfer of title or shipment of the product to the customer 
for product sales with acceptance conditions based upon the passage of 
table of contents contractually specified time periods  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of such time that the acceptance period expires or is waived by our customers upon request 
we grant price protection provisions to certain customers and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions 
we establish allowances for estimated product returns and price protection in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating future product returns  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated return policies and practices  and historical trends 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 which provides guidance on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses  and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  we review our customers credit worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services  our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers industries 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual allowance for doubtful accounts and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
write downs in inventory value depend on various items  including factors related to customer demand  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
whenever inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve 
we believe that  when made  the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual inventory write downs 
if customer demand for our inventory is substantially less than our estimates  inventory write downs may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we periodically assess the valuation of intangible and long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
our assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of intangible and long lived assets to their fair values  which are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
the timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value 
we monitor our intangible and 
table of contents long lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value intangible and long lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the majority of our long lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over relatively short periods  typically two to five years 
this reduces the risk of large impairment charges in any given period 
however  most of these assets are associated with technology that may change rapidly and such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis 
provision for warranty costs 
we accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related replacement  repairs or rework of products 
our warranty policy generally provides one to three years of coverage for products following the date of purchase 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized 
in estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors  including the historical frequency and volume of claims  and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty 
the warranty provision for our products is determined by using a financial model to estimate future warranty costs 
our financial model takes into consideration actual product failure rates  estimated replacement over the contractual warranty period  repair or rework expenses  and potential risks associated with our different products 
the risk levels  warranty cost information  and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated  if and when  these inputs change 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex products 
depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing  actual product failure rates or actual warranty costs could be materially greater than our estimates  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
royalty costs 
we have intellectual property license agreements which generally require us to make royalty payments based on a percentage of the revenue generated by sales of products incorporating the licensed technology 
we recognize royalty obligations in accordance with the terms of the respective royalty agreements 
we have also accrued for estimated royalty costs in situations where we do not have agreements based upon our current best estimate of the royalty obligation 
these estimates are based on various market data information and other relevant information 
if we enter into such agreements  or when additional market data becomes available  we will revise our estimates if necessary 
income taxes 
on january  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable to or refundable by tax authorities in the current fiscal year 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and assess the valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the 
table of contents implementation of tax planning strategies 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in a decrease in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
during  and  we recorded non cash deferred income tax benefits expense of million  million and million  respectively  for the changes in the valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate the necessity of the valuation allowance based on the remaining deferred tax assets 
foreign exchange forward contracts 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the economic exposure associated with cash and accounts receivable balances denominated in euros 
our forward contracts do not qualify as accounting hedges 
we mark to market the forward contracts and include unrealized gains and losses in the current period as a component of other income expense 
during   and  we recorded unrealized losses of approximately   and million  respectively  on our forward contracts 
these unrealized losses were offset by realized foreign currency gains on euro denominated transactions of approximately   and million during   and  respectively 
realized gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions are recorded in other income expense

our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and include compensation expense as calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
share based compensation expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
under sfas no 
r  we elected to value our share based payment option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these significant assumptions include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards and the expected term of stock options 
we determine our expected volatility by using a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  to derive our expected volatility assumption as allowed under sfas no 
r and sab no 
share based payment sab 
implied volatility is based on the market prices of third party traded options of our common stock 
we calculate volatility using a blend of implied volatility and our historical volatility as we believe that it is more reflective of expected volatility than using only historical volatility 
the expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term of options granted is estimated using the average of the vesting date  the contractual term and historical experience 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value under the black scholes option pricing model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of our stock 
our risk free interest rate assumption is based upon currently available rates on zero coupon us government issues for the expected term of our stock options 
the expected dividend rate is not applicable to us as we have not historically declared or paid dividends nor do we currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
sfas no 
r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and we have estimated our forfeitures based on historical experience 
we will revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from our estimates 

table of contents if we change any of the critical assumptions that we use in the black scholes option pricing model such as expected volatility or expected term or if we decide to use a different valuation model in the future  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly in the future from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  as the guidance by regulators for sfas no 
r is relatively new  the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value using generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures related to fair value measurements 
this standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of sfas will change current practice 
sfas is applied prospectively and is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and for interim periods within those years 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  in october  the fasb issued fsp fas fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the guidance provided by fsp  which was effective upon issuance  and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas related to financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our future consolidated financial statements related to non financial assets and liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
most of the provisions in sfas are elective  however the amendment to sfas no 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale securities 
the fair value option established by sfas permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a business entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
the company has elected not to apply the fair value option to any of its financial instruments that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the amendment to sfas did not have a significant impact to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r sfas r  business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements of sfas r  will depend on whether it engages in such activity  and also upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions it may consummate after the effective date 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this new standard requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments  including those used in hedging activities 
it is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   and will be applicable to the company in the first quarter of the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements of sfas  when effective  will depend on whether the company engages in such activity  and also upon the nature  terms and size of the activity as of and after the effective date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits our credit exposure to any single issuer 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  all of which are stated at fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of million of our cash and cash equivalents at december   as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  the remaining million of our investments by approximately  while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
global credit risk we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities of various security holdings  types  and maturities with a number of financial institutions 
we place our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities in instruments and with institutions that meet credit quality standards specified in our investment policy guidelines at the time the investments are made 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and to any one type of instrument 
our ability to support our working capital needs depends  in part  on our available cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
as a result  any significant decrease in the value of our investments may materially adversely impact our ability to support our working capital needs 
we maintain cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities with institutions in amounts that  if credit insurance is available  may exceed depository or investment insurance coverage available for such balances 
as a result  the company is subject to market valuation risk and counterparty risk that exposes it to losses should significant changes occur 
the recent global credit crisis has exacerbated the credit risk associated with certain financial instruments  predominantly those instruments issued by certain financial institutions 
the company currently believes that its exposure to these issuers  through its investment in individual securities  is not significant 
however  the company maintains investments in certain money market funds that have positions in financial instruments of impacted financial institutions 
the company s money market investments were approximately million at december  these money market funds attempt to maintain a net asset value nav of per unit of investment 
should the underlying investments held by these money market funds suffer significant losses to market value due to interest rate changes or perceived counterparty risk  the nav of these money market funds may suffer declines below the targeted nav 
the company holds money market funds that target a balance of investment return and preservation of invested capital through diversified holdings 
as such  the company does not believe it currently has significant exposure to nav declines for its money market holdings 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk the company generates significant euro denominated revenues  with resulting euro denominated accounts receivable  from sales to customers that are members of the european union 
during the year ended december   euro denominated revenue was approximately million 
our company purchases products  and incurs trade liabilities  from our contract manufacturers under contracts based in us dollars 
as a result  we lack significant euro denominated purchases and trade liabilities to offset our exposure to euro denominated sales activity and accounts receivable 
we are therefore subject to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  principally change in the value of the euro versus the us dollar 
as a result  changes in euro to us dollar foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign exchange contracts  principally forward currency foreign exchange contracts 
these forward currency foreign exchange contracts cover a portion  generally to  but may cover up to  of the company s euro based financial assets 
at december   we had approximately million million of euro denominated financial assets  as compared to million million in forward currency foreign exchange contracts with expiration dates of days or less 
at december   we recorded an unrealized loss of approximately  on our outstanding forward contracts 
in addition  at december   we recorded approximately  in unrealized foreign currency gains related to our outstanding euro denominated accounts receivable balances 
both the unrealized loss on the outstanding forward contracts and the unrealized gains on outstanding euro denominated receivables were recorded in other income and expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
assuming a translation of our euro denominated revenue for the year ended december  at an average euro to us dollar exchange rate of and a uniform ten percent strengthening or weakening of this exchange rate  we estimate that income before income taxes for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million 
this analysis does not give effect to any forward currency foreign exchange contracts that may be used to hedge foreign currency risk 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the hypothetical gains and losses discussed above based on fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and our actual exposure and hedging transactions 
revenues generated outside the united states  including european union and other countries  as a percentage of total revenues  were approximately for the year ended december  and for the company s revenues generated by sales to non european union countries are typically denominated in us dollars 
competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate may limit our ability to increase prices in the event of adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
sales of these products are affected by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  and in particular  the euro 
any long term strengthening of the us dollar could depress the demand for these us manufactured products  reduce sales  or cause the company to reduce per unit selling prices
