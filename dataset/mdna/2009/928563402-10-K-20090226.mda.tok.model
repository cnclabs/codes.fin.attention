overview our primary source of revenues is the licensing of virtual infrastructure software solutions and related support and services through a variety of distribution channels for use by businesses and organizations of all sizes and across numerous industries in their information technology infrastructure 
our virtual infrastructure software solutions run on industry standard desktops and servers and support a wide range of operating system and application environments  as well as networking and storage infrastructures 
we have developed a multi channel distribution model to expand our presence and to reach various segments of the industry 
in  and we derived over of our revenues from our channel partners  which include distributors  resellers  x system vendors and system integrators 
we have also developed a network of indirect channel partners who fulfill orders through our direct channel partners 
the majority of our revenues result from contracts that include both perpetual software licenses and ongoing software maintenance contracts 
license revenues are recognized when the elements of revenue recognition are complete 
software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the software maintenance period  and include renewals of software maintenance sold after the initial software maintenance period expires 
we also recognize revenues from professional services provided to our customers 
we have achieved significant revenue growth to date by focusing on delivering new virtual infrastructure software solutions technology and products  expanding our network of technology and distribution partners  increasing product awareness  promoting the adoption of virtualization and building long term relationships with our customers through the adoption of enterprise license agreements elas 
our current financial focus is on revenue growth to generate cash flows to fund our expansion of industry segment share and our development of virtualization based products for data centers  desktops and cloud computing 
we expect to continue our revenue growth by broadening our virtual infrastructure software solutions technology and product portfolio 
we experienced growth in our channel partner transaction business and in the acquisition of new customers during as compared to however  since the end of the second quarter of we have observed that customers are subjecting larger orders  such as elas  to a longer review process and 
table of contents in certain cases are purchasing products through the channel to meet their immediate needs  forgoing larger discounts offered under elas 
we believe this trend primarily correlated to the recent global economic uncertainty and may continue throughout and perhaps longer 
we believe the use of virtual infrastructure solutions is at early stages by customers 
although we are currently the leading provider of virtual infrastructure solutions  we face competitive threats to our leadership from a number of companies  some of which have significantly greater resources than we do  which could result in increased pressure to reduce prices on our offerings 
as a result  we believe it is important to continue to invest in strategic initiatives related to product research and development  market expansion and associated support functions to expand our industry leadership 
these investments could result in contracting operating margins as we invest in our future 
we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our product development objectives through continued investment in our current resources  supplemented with strategic hires and acquisitions  funded through the operating cash flows generated from the sale of our existing products and services 
we believe this is the appropriate priority for the long term health of our business 
in evaluating our results  we also focus on operating margin excluding stock based compensation  employer taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets  the write off of in process research and development  and the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs as we believe this measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons 
a portion of our services revenues is recognized in periods of up to five years subsequent to the initial contract  whereas most of our license revenues are recognized within the first quarter of contract signing 
as a result  variability in operating margin can result from differences in when we price our service and when the cost is incurred 
substantially all of our international revenues are for contracts in us dollars to international channel partners 
a portion of our operating expenses is in currencies other than the us dollar 
this difference may cause variability in operating margins due to fluctuations in the us dollar compared to other currencies 
we are not currently focused on short term operating margin expansion  but rather on investing at appropriate rates to support our growth and future product offerings in what may be a substantially more competitive environment  as a result  our future operating margins may decline from current levels 
prior to our initial public offering ipo in august  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of emc corporation emc  and as such we relied on emc to provide a number of administrative support services and facilities in other countries 
although we continue to operate under an administrative services agreement and continue to receive support from emc  we have invested in our own administrative functions  including our finance  legal and human resources functions 
we are also incurring additional costs as a public company  including audit  investor relations  expanded information systems  stock administration and regulatory compliance costs 
our relationship with emc as of december   emc owned  shares of class a common stock and all  shares of class b common stock  representing approximately of our total outstanding shares of common stock and of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock 
in  and  we recognized professional services revenues of  and  respectively  for services provided to emc s customers pursuant to our contractual agreements with emc 
in  we recognized revenues from server and desktop products and services purchased by emc for internal use of pursuant to our contractual agreements with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from server and desktop products and services purchased by emc for internal use were included in deferred revenue 
we purchased storage systems from emc for  and in the years ended  and  respectively 
through the third quarter of  the systems purchased from emc were at emc s cost 
since the fourth quarter of  the systems purchased from emc were at a discount off of emc s list price 

table of contents for certain corporate functions provided by emc  and of expenses were allocated to us by emc in and  respectively 
in  this amount was not significant 
in certain geographic regions where we do not have an established legal entity  we contract with emc subsidiaries for support services and emc employees who are managed by our personnel 
the costs incurred by emc on our behalf related to these employees include an estimated arm s length mark up and were included as expenses in our financial statements 
these costs include expenses for salaries and benefits  travel  and rent 
additionally  emc incurs certain costs on our behalf in the us  which primarily relate to shared systems for travel 
the total of these costs were  and in the years ended  and  respectively 
as part of our tax sharing agreement  we paid emc income taxes of  and in  and  respectively  for our portion of their consolidated federal income taxes 
these amounts differed from the amounts owed on a stand alone basis and the differences are presented as a component of stockholders equity 
in  the difference between the amount of tax calculated on a stand alone basis and the amount of tax calculated per the tax sharing agreement was recorded as an increase in stockholders equity of in and  this difference was recorded as a decrease in stockholders equity of and  respectively 
interest income expense with emc  net  primarily consists of interest expense on the note payable to emc  offset by interest income that has been earned on our intercompany balance with emc 
in and  and  respectively  of interest expense was recorded related to the note payable to emc and was included in the and  respectively  of interest expense with emc  net  recorded on the consolidated statements of income 
in  we earned interest income with emc  net  of our interest income and our expenses as a separate  stand alone company may be higher or lower than the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
in  we resolved with emc certain acquisition related intercompany liabilities due to emc 
as a result  intercompany liabilities due to emc of were recorded as a capital contribution from emc in additional paid in capital without the issuance of additional equity by us or remittance of any cash 
prior to march  our employees participated in the emc corporation k savings plan 
emc cross charged us for the costs associated with our employees who participated in the emc plan 
in march  our employees began participating in our k savings plan and ceased participation in the emc plan 
see note i to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had due to emc  which was partially offset by due from emc 
as of december   we had due to emc  which was partially offset by due from emc 
the net amounts due to emc in and were and  respectively  and resulted from the related party transactions described above 
as of december   we had of income taxes receivable due from emc and of income taxes payable due to emc 
as of december   we had of income taxes payable due to emc 
balances due to or from emc which are unrelated to tax obligations are generally settled in cash within days of each quarter end 
the timing of the tax payments due to and from emc is governed by the tax sharing agreement with emc 
given that the amounts we recorded for our intercompany transactions with emc did not arise from transactions negotiated at arm s length with an unrelated third party  the financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows had we engaged in such transactions with an unrelated third party during all periods presented 
accordingly  our historical results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance as a stand alone company 

table of contents income statement presentation sources of revenues license revenues our license revenues consist of revenues earned from the licensing of our software products 
these products are generally licensed on a perpetual basis and are generally priced based upon the number of physical desktops or server processors on which our software runs 
software maintenance revenues software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period 
typically  our contract periods range from one to five years 
customers receive various types of technical support based on the level of support purchased 
customers who are party to software maintenance agreements with us are entitled to receive product updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services revenues professional services include design  implementation and training 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products  as these services do not alter the product capabilities and may be performed by our customers or other vendors 
professional services engagements for which we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion are recognized on proportional performance to date based upon the hours incurred 
revenues on all other professional services engagements are recognized upon completion 
operating expenses cost of license revenues our cost of license revenues principally consists of amortization of capitalized software development costs and the cost of fulfillment of our software 
this cost of fulfillment of our software includes product packaging  personnel costs and related overhead associated with the physical and electronic delivery of our software products 
cost of services revenues our cost of services revenues includes the costs of personnel and related overhead to deliver technical support on our products and to provide our professional services 
research and development expenses our research and development r d expenses include the personnel and related overhead associated with the research and development of new product offerings  including depreciation expense  and the enhancement of our existing software offerings 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs and related overhead associated with the sale and marketing of our license and services offerings  as well as the cost of certain marketing initiatives  including our semi annual vmworld conference 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs to support the overall business 
these expenses include the costs associated with our finance  facilities  human resources  it infrastructure  and legal departments 

table of contents results of operations revenues our revenues for the years ended  and are as follows for the year ended december  revenues license services software maintenance professional services total services percentage of revenues license services software maintenance professional services total services revenues united states international percentage of revenues united states international total revenues were  in   in and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in the growth in revenues in reflected an increase of in license revenues and an increase of in services revenues as compared to the growth in revenues in reflected an increase of in license revenues and an increase of in services revenues as compared to international revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to in  from in and in our revenue contracts with international customers are denominated in us dollars 
during the last four months of  exchange rates between the us dollar  the euro  british pound and australian dollar experienced a significant degree of volatility 
our distributors and resellers generally quote to end user customers in local currency  and accordingly  uncertainty of short term exchange rates may disrupt regular quoting of orders as distributors are subject to higher degrees of exchange risk 
given the recent economic downturn and global financial crisis  we have applied additional scrutiny and analysis around the collectibility of transactions with certain customers  including but not limited to those customers in the financial services  insurance  and automotive industries and we continue to monitor the appropriateness of established customer credit limits 
we do not record accounts receivable or deferred revenue 
table of contents or recognize revenue relating to transactions where collectibility is not probable 
we experienced an increase in these transactions in the fourth quarter of we recognize such transactions upon cash collection and recognize revenue as earned in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
the current economic situation is creating a high degree of uncertainty around how much money will be spent on information technology it over the foreseeable future 
we believe the uncertainty is causing customers to be conservative and preserve their cash 
given these global economic conditions  we expect total revenues to increase in compared to  but at a lower rate of growth 
we also expect our license and professional services revenues growth rate to decelerate  and potentially contract  compared to license revenues software license revenues were  in  in and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in we believe a significant majority of the revenue growth in compared to  as well as compared to  is the result of greater demand for our virtualization product offerings attributable to wider industry acceptance of virtualization as part of organizations it infrastructure  a broadened product portfolio and expansion of our network of indirect channel partners 
we expect the rate of growth in our license revenues to decelerate or contract due primarily to the size and scale of our business and lengthened sales cycles attributable to challenges our customers may face in the current uncertain economic environment  such as decreases in it budgets and difficulties in obtaining financing 
we expect that license revenues will be lower in the first quarter of than the comparable quarter of due to the unprecedented level of uncertainty regarding future it spending  we lack visibility into whether or how long this trend will continue 
elas continue to be a significant component of our revenue growth and are offered both direct and through certain channel partners 
elas are core to our strategy to build long term relationships with customers as they commit to our virtual infrastructure solutions in their data centers 
elas provide a base from which to sell additional products  such as our application and infrastructure management suite and our disaster recovery products 
under a typical ela  a portion of the revenues is attributed to the license and recognized immediately  but the majority is deferred and recognized as services revenues in future periods 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  we observed seasonal strength in our elas from our enterprise accounts and comparative weakness in the transactional business especially with price sensitive customers  such as the academic market and smaller businesses 
we expect to continue to observe the lengthening of the sales cycle on elas that management believes is primarily correlated to economic uncertainty 
during the second half of the year  customers began purchasing our solutions in smaller quantities through the channel to meet their immediate needs  forgoing larger discounts offered under elas 
we expect that customers may continue smaller purchases through the channel at least through the first quarter of  and perhaps longer 
we sell our products through a network of channel partners  which includes distributors  resellers  x system vendors and systems integrators 
as we expand geographically  we may add additional direct channel partners 
the increases in revenues in primarily resulted from increased sales volumes through our existing direct channel partners 
these increases were driven by several factors  including greater demand for our virtualization product offerings  wider industry acceptance of virtualization as part of an organization s it infrastructure  a broadened product portfolio and expansion of our indirect channel partner network which purchase products from our direct partners 
we divide our license revenues into two classes data center products and other products 
our data center products include a hypervisor for system partitioning the software environment from its underlying hardware infrastructure and additional tools that enable the aggregation of multiple servers  storage infrastructure and networks into shared pools of resources that can be delivered dynamically  securely and reliably to applications as needed 
other products primarily include desktop virtualization products which decouple the 
table of contents entire desktop environment from its underlying device  enabling customers to create user centric instead of device centric desktop environments 
revenues from data center products were   and in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of license revenues  revenues from data center products were  and in  and  respectively 
revenues from other products were   and in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of license revenues  revenues from other products were  and in  and  respectively 
our indirect channel partners obtain software licenses and services from our distributors and x system vendors and market and sell them to end user customers 
in the first quarter of  we introduced new programs for these channel partners to assist them to quickly establish and expand their virtualization practices and drive new customer acquisition 
we believe these programs encourage channel loyalty and may facilitate our ability to reach additional industry segments and acquire new customers 
in addition  we have a direct sales force that complements these efforts 
our sales force works with our channel partners to introduce them to customers and new sales opportunities 
our channel partners also introduce our sales force to their customers 
services revenues services revenues were in  in and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in we expect that services revenues will compose a larger proportion of our revenue mix and revenue growth in the increase in services revenues in was primarily attributable to growth in our software maintenance revenues 
software maintenance revenues were in  in and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in this growth reflects the increase in our license revenues  as software maintenance services are generally purchased with licenses  the benefit from multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods and renewals of existing customer software maintenance contracts 
professional services revenues were in  in and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in professional services revenues increased due to growing demand for design and implementation services and training programs  as end user organizations deployed virtualization across their organizations 
although  professional services revenues increased year over year  professional services revenues in the fourth quarter of were flat sequentially to the third quarter due to our transitioning some of this business to our partners 
although we will continue to serve our customers directly  we encourage our partners to build their professional services businesses which we believe will leverage our license sales through this channel

table of contents operating expenses without stock based compensation are non gaap financial measures 
see non gaap financial measures below 
aside from the effects of stock based compensation shown in the table above  the following discussion highlights additional factors that impacted our results of operations 
cost of license revenues the decreases in our cost of license revenues as a percentage of revenues were primarily attributable to decreased amortization of intangible assets 
as a percentage of revenues  amortization of intangible assets decreased by percentage point of revenues to of revenues in as compared with in  and decreased by percentage points of revenues in as compared with in the cost of fulfillment of our software  which includes product packaging  personnel costs and related overhead associated with the physical and electronic delivery of our software products remained relatively flat 
in the future when recently capitalized software development costs begin to amortize as a component of cost of license revenues  our cost of license revenues will increase in absolute dollars 
cost of services revenues the increases in our cost of services revenues were primarily attributable to the increased direct support  professional services personnel and third party professional services costs to support the increased services revenues 
research and development expenses the increases in r d expenses were primarily attributable to increased facilities  salaries and benefits expenses resulting from incremental headcount added in support of feature functionality development  sustainment of existing products  and new product development  which are intended to grow our future business 
partially offsetting this increase in expenses was an increase in software capitalization by to including of stock based compensation in as compared with  and by to including of stock based compensation in as compared with including of stock based compensation in as the number of future projects requiring capitalization may decrease  our future r d expenses could increase 
included in our r d expenses  we had in process research and development ipr d expense of  related to acquisitions in we had no ipr d expense in in  ipr d expense was sales and marketing expenses the increases in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars consisted primarily of higher salaries and benefits expenses due to both increases in sales and marketing personnel and higher commission expense resulting from increased sales volumes 
our sales and marketing expenses also increased due to marketing expenses related to our ongoing international market expansion and marketing expenses related to our branding initiative in a portion of our sales and marketing expenses is denominated in foreign currencies and thus exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
upon consolidation  as exchange rates vary  the amount of sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate in response to changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the foreign currencies in which the expenses are payable 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of additional salaries and benefits expenses resulting from the additional resources to support the growth of our business and to expand our own administrative functions 

table of contents stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  versus versus stock based compensation  excluding amounts capitalized under fas stock based compensation capitalized under fas stock based compensation  including amounts capitalized under fas stock based compensation expenses  excluding amounts capitalized under fas  increased primarily due to broad based stock option and restricted stock unit grants made under the vmware equity and incentive plan beginning in the second quarter of between the time of our acquisition by emc in january and june  we did not issue equity awards in our stock to our employees 
during this period  employees received stock based compensation in the form of emc stock options and restricted stock awards and units as a result of grants made by emc s board of directors 
beginning in june  we granted equity incentive awards under our equity and incentive plan in anticipation of our ipo 
in connection with the ipo in august  we conducted an exchange offer pursuant to which we offered our eligible employees the ability to exchange their existing emc options and restricted stock awards for options to purchase our class a common stock and restricted stock awards of our class a common stock  respectively 
in september  we completed an offer to exchange certain employee stock options issued under the vmware equity and incentive plan exchange offer 
certain previously granted options were exchanged for new  lower priced stock options granted on a one for one basis 
executive officers and members of our board of directors were excluded from participating in the exchange offer 
options for an aggregate of million shares of our class a common stock were exchanged with a weighted average exercise price per share of 
options granted pursuant to the exchange offer have an exercise price of per share  vest pro rata over four years beginning september  with no credit for past vesting and have a new six year option term 
the exchange offer resulted in incremental stock based compensation expense of to be recognized over the four year vesting term 
in september  we awarded million restricted stock units to certain employees  including a portion for international employees who were not eligible to participate in the exchange offer and a portion for retention purposes 
these awards generally will vest over a three year or four year period 
these awards resulted in stock based compensation expense of to be recognized over the three year or four year vesting term 
as of december   the total unamortized fair value of our outstanding equity based awards and emc equity based awards held by our employees was approximately this amount will be recognized over the awards requisite service periods  and is expected to result in stock based compensation expense of approximately   and for   and  respectively 
in future quarters  our stock based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of additional equity grants in future periods 
during  we expect to issue equity awards through refresh grants to our employees 
the stock based compensation expense is subject to the amount of stock based compensation that may be capitalized as costs incurred for the development of new software products  software developed for internal use and the amount of awards that ultimately vest 

table of contents intangible assets amortization expense was lower in as compared to  and flat in compared to  due primarily to decreasing amortization for intangible assets resulting from emc s acquisition of us  offset in part by additional amortization for new acquisitions 
the amortization expense was classified as follows in the consolidated income statements for the year ended december  cost of license revenues sales and marketing general and administrative total intangible amortization expense operating income the operating margin in increased primarily as a result of a decrease in expense from the net effect of capitalizing and amortizing software development costs 
a portion of our costs of revenues  primarily the costs of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  and a portion of our operating expenses mainly related to sales  sales support and r d  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  the british pound  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the indian rupee  and the japanese yen 
these costs and the resulting effect on operating income are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
to quantify the effect on our operating income of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  we translate our non us dollar operating expenses into local currency using current period average exchange rates 
operating expenses are then reconverted into the us dollar using the prior period average exchange rates and the results are compared to quantify the impact 
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  operating income decreased by in  in and in if the dollar weakens or strengthens in relation to other currencies  such as the euro  we expect this to have a negative or positive effect  respectively  on our operating margins 
the current economic situation is creating a high degree of uncertainty around how much money will be spent on it over the foreseeable future 
we continue to expect that our operating expenses will increase in absolute terms and could increase as a percentage of revenues as we intend to continue our strategic investments in product development and expansion into strategic geographic markets 
investment income investment income was in  in and in investment income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
investment income increased in compared to due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances  primarily as a result of cash provided by operating activities  as well as a full year of interest earned on proceeds we received in the middle of the third quarter of from our ipo and the sale of shares of our class a common stock to intel capital 
the increase in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances was partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest rates in investment income increased in compared to due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances  primarily as a result of the proceeds we received from our ipo and the sale of shares of our class a common stock to intel capital 
we expect investment income in the first quarter of to decrease as compared with the fourth quarter of due to an anticipated decline in investments yields as a result of decreasing interest rates 

table of contents interest income expense with emc  net interest expense with emc  net  was in and in interest income with emc  net  was in in and  interest expense with emc  net  consisted primarily of and  respectively  of interest expense incurred on the note issued to emc in april  net of interest income earned on intercompany balances 
the decrease in interest expense in was due to a lower weighted average interest rate on the note of in as compared to in  as well as a repayment of of the principal balance in august of the interest rate on the note payable resets quarterly and is determined using the day libor rate plus basis points  two business days prior to the first day of each fiscal quarter 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for was compared to for and for the slightly lower effective tax rate in was mainly attributable to a net benefit resulting from an increase in tax credits 
the change in the effective rate which decreased to in from in was primarily attributable to the decrease in the other non deductible permanent differences of percentage points from to this decrease was primarily attributable to the change of our tax structure  whereby income in earned abroad principally qualified for deferral from u 
s 
taxation  whereas in the income was principally taxed in the united states 
the other significant contributing factor to the decrease in the effective tax rate from to was that our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions  which is typically lower than our income tax rate in the united states  resulted in an increase of a favorable tax benefit of percentage points from to offsetting this favorable tax benefit was the decrease in the generated tax credits by percentage points from to the tax rate is expected to be higher than the tax rate primarily due to a forecasted shift of earnings from low tax non us jurisdictions to the united states and an increase in unrecognized tax positions relative to income before tax 
the effective tax rate for is based upon the income for the year  the composition of the income in different countries  and adjustments  if any  for the potential tax consequences  benefits  resolutions of audits or other tax contingencies 
our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the united states 
our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  the impact of accounting for business combinations under the new financial accounting standard no 
revised  business combinations fas no 
r  changes in our international organization  and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
non gaap financial measures regulation s k item e  use of non gaap financial measures in commission filings  and other securities and exchange commission sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
our measures of operating expenses and operating income without stock based compensation meet the definition of non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures  which are used as measures of our performance  should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for or in isolation from  measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
we provide this information to show the impact of stock based compensation on our results of operations  as it is excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock based compensation and value such awards accordingly and because determining the fair value of the related equity awards involves a high degree of judgment and estimation 
when evaluating the performance of our individual functional groups  we do not consider stock based compensation charges 
likewise  we exclude stock based compensation expense from our short and long term 
table of contents operating plans 
our management team is held accountable for cash based compensation and such amounts are included in their operating plans 
due to its nature  individual managers generally are unable to project the impact of stock based compensation and accordingly they are not held accountable for the impact of equity award grants 
although we acknowledge that stock based compensation is necessary to attract and retain quality employees  our consideration of stock based compensation places its primary emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants 
for comparability purposes  we believe it is useful to provide a non gaap financial measure that excludes stock based compensation in order to better understand the long term performance of our core business and to facilitate the comparison of our results to the results of our peer companies because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  or fas no 
r 
furthermore  unlike cash compensation  the value of stock based compensation is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors  such as market volatility  that are beyond our control 
accordingly  we believe that the presentation of non gaap operating expenses and operating income when read in conjunction with our reported gaap operating expenses and operating income can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
operating expenses without stock based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses related to the compensation of our people 
more specifically  if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock based compensation  it is likely that cash based compensation expense included in our operating expenses would be higher 
we compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements 
stock based compensation programs are an important element of our compensation structure and all forms of stock based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations 
management strongly encourages stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
liquidity and capital resources december  cash and cash equivalents our cash flows for  and were as follows for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities our operating activities for each year in the three years ended december  have generated adequate cash to meet our operating needs 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  compared to  as of december  during the year ended december   key drivers in the increase of cash included the generation of of cash from operating activities and from issuance of common stock  primarily as a result of the exercise of employee stock options 
in  we invested of cash for business acquisitions and used of cash for capital expenditures 
we invest excess cash predominantly in money market securities that are liquid and of high quality investment grade 
the fair value for securities is determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date 
we limit the amount of our domestic and international investments with any one issuer and also monitor the 
table of contents portfolio so that investments are placed in funds with dissimilar economic characteristics  thereby diversifying the credit risk 
as of december   all of our domestic money market funds were participating in the temporary guarantee program for money market funds  which is backed by the us treasury department but limited to the balance in our money market funds as of september  the temporary guarantee program for money market funds expires on april  as of december   these guaranteed funds represented of our cash and cash equivalents balance 
our international money market funds comprise of our cash and cash equivalents balance and are invested in offshore money market funds and time deposits 
in addition to investment in money market securities  we also use excess cash to support our growing infrastructure needs  to expand our operations and as consideration for acquisitions and strategic investments 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in and will use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income  adjusted for non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
non cash adjustments include depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  tax benefits from stock based compensation and other adjustments 
in the years ended december   and  there were significant increases in deferred revenue that positively impacted cash flow from operating activities 
these increases were largely driven by an increase in deferred maintenance revenue for which we are typically paid when the product is sold 
in each of the three years ended december   and cash flows from operating activities were negatively impacted by the increase in our accounts receivable balance  which resulted from increases in our revenues 
however  the decrease in the days of sales outstanding metric over each of the three years partially offset the negative impact of the increase in accounts receivable 
additionally  cash flow from operating activities was negatively affected by for an increase in income tax receivable from emc in the receivable arose because we had a stand alone taxable loss for the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to tax deductions arising from both non qualified stock option exercises and from the vesting of restricted stock 
under the tax sharing agreement with emc  emc is obligated to pay us an amount equal to the tax benefit that emc will recognize on its consolidated tax return 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to business acquisitions  capital expenditures  and capitalized software development costs 
we invested for acquisitions in  compared to for acquisitions in and for an acquisition in acquisitions are an important element of our corporate strategy and we expect to continue to invest in strategic acquisitions in the future 
our capital expenditures totaled   and in  and  respectively 
during  our capital expenditures primarily related to the construction at our headquarters facility and our data center and investing in computer and network equipment to support increased personnel and related infrastructure requirements both domestically and internationally 
capital expenditures in were higher compared to other years  primarily due to our investment in our new headquarters facility 
we purchased from emc buildings already under construction for  which was the cost expended by emc during construction 
we also purchased furniture and fixtures for the new facilities and invested cash in the remaining buildings under development 
in addition to the investment in our headquarters facilities in  we purchased computer and network equipment to support increased personnel and related infrastructure requirements 
our capitalized software development costs  excluding stock based compensation expense  totaled   and in  and  respectively 
the increase in capitalized software development costs was the result of the deployment of additional resources to support the development of software products  as well as the timing of when those products reached technological feasibility 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities in  cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by of issuances of our common stock from the exercise of options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan espp 
between the time of our acquisition by emc in january and june  we did not issue equity awards in our stock to our employees 
during this period  employees received stock based compensation in the form of emc stock options and restricted stock awards and units as a result of grants made by emc s board of directors 
beginning in june  we granted equity incentive awards under our equity and incentive plan in anticipation of our ipo 
as such  we had no financing activities in and of financing activities in related to the exercise of options 
upon adoption of fas no 
r on january   we have included as part of our cash flows from financing activities the benefit of tax deductions related to stock based compensation in excess of the tax benefits expected at the grant date of the related stock based awards 
this amount is shown as a reduction to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from financing activities 
net cash flows remain unchanged from what would have been reported prior to the adoption of fas no 
r 
future cash proceeds from issuances of common stock and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation will depend upon and could fluctuate significantly from period to period based upon the market value of our stock  the number of awards exercised  sold or vested  the tax benefit realized and the tax affected compensation recognized 
the above described financing cash inflows were partially offset by of shares repurchased in to cover tax withholding obligations in conjunction with the net share settlement upon the vesting of restricted stock 
in  as a result of the completion of our ipo  we received net proceeds of  from issuance of our class a common stock 
we also received net proceeds of from the sale of our class a common stock to intel capital in we used a portion of these proceeds to pay of principal on the intercompany note payable owed to emc 
there were no financing cash flows from financing activities in to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments guarantees and indemnification obligations we enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with  among others  distributors  resellers  x system vendors and system integrators 
most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that one of our products infringes or misappropriates a patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and or other intellectual property right 
certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage  personal injury or the acts or omissions by us  our employees  agents or representatives 
in addition  from time to time we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers 

table of contents contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity 
the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years note payable to emc operating leases purchase orders fin other agreements financing liability related to data center total includes payments from january  through december  includes payments from january  through december  the note is due and payable in full on or before april   however  we can pay down the note at an earlier date in full or in part at our election 
as of december   we had of non current net unrecognized tax benefits under fin we are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 
includes various contractual agreements  primarily relating to royalties and subscriptions 
relates to an agreement to lease space for a data center facility 
see note g to our consolidated financial statements 
our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world 
while our purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles that require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note a to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock options in  we adopted fas no 
r  to account for stock based compensation expense 
fas no 
r requires recognizing compensation costs for all share based payment awards made to employees based upon the awards estimated grant date fair value 
additionally  we applied the provisions of security and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
on share based payment to our adoption of fas no 
r 
our financial statements include the adoption of fas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method of adoption  which does not result in the restatement of results from prior periods 

table of contents we elected to estimate the fair value of employee stock option awards and the espp using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of our share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the risk free interest rate associated with the expected term of the awards  expected dividends and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  this could have a material impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the licensing of software and related services 
we recognize revenues for software products and related services in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
given the recent economic downturn and global financial crisis  we have applied additional scrutiny and analysis around the collectibility of transactions with certain customers  including but not limited to those customers in the financial services  insurance and automotive industries  and we continue to monitor the appropriateness of established customer credit limits 
our assessment of likelihood of collection is a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition 
we do not record accounts receivable or deferred revenue or recognize revenue relating to transactions where collectibility is not probable 
we experienced an increase in these transactions in the fourth quarter of we recognize such transactions upon cash collection and recognize revenue as earned in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
we recognize license revenues from the sale of software when risk of loss transfers  which is generally upon electronic shipment 
we license our software under perpetual licenses through our direct sales force and through our channel of distributors  resellers  x system vendors and systems integrators 
we defer revenues relating to products that have shipped into our channel until our products are sold through the channel 
we estimate and record reserves for products that are not sold through the channel based on historical trends and relevant current information 
we obtain sell through information from distributors and certain resellers on a monthly basis and reconcile any estimates  if necessary  made in the previous month 
historically  actual information has not differed materially from the related estimate 
for our channel partners who do not report sell through data  we determine sell through based on payment of such distributors and certain resellers accounts receivable balances and other relevant factors 
for software sold by x system vendors and bundled with their hardware  unless we have a separate license agreement with the end user  revenues are recognized in arrears upon the receipt of binding royalty reports 
the accuracy of our reserves depends on our ability to estimate the product sold through the channels and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we offer rebates to certain channel partners  which are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related product sale is recognized 
when rebates are based on the set percentage of actual sales  we recognize the costs of the rebates as a reduction of revenue when the underlying revenue is recognized 
in cases where rebates are earned if a cumulative level of sales is achieved  we recognize the cost of the rebates as a reduction of revenue proportionally for each sale that is required to achieve the target 
the estimated reserves for channel 
table of contents rebates and sales incentives are based on channel partners actual performance against the terms and conditions of the programs  historical trends and the value of the rebates 
the accuracy of these reserves for these rebates and sales incentives depends on our ability to estimate these items and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
with the exception of one of our desktop products  our return policy does not allow end users to return products for a refund 
certain distributors and resellers may rotate stock when new versions of a product are released 
we estimate future product returns at the time of sale 
our estimate is based on historical return rates  levels of inventory held by distributors and resellers and other relevant factors 
the accuracy of these reserves depends on our ability to estimate sales returns and stock rotation among other criteria 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
returns have not been material to date and have been in line with our expectations 
our services revenues consist of software maintenance and professional services 
we recognize software maintenance revenues ratably over the contract period 
professional services include design  implementation and training 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products because these services do not alter the product capabilities and may be performed by customers or other vendors 
professional services engagements for which we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion are recognized on a proportional performance basis based upon the hours incurred 
revenues on all other professional services engagements are recognized upon completion 
however  if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
our software products are typically sold with software maintenance and or professional services 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for professional services is based upon the standard rates we charge for such services when sold separately 
vsoe of fair value for software maintenance services is established by the rates charged in stand alone sales of software maintenance contracts or the stated renewal rate for software maintenance included in the license agreement 
the revenues allocated to the software license included in multiple element contracts represent the residual amount of the contract after the fair value of the other elements has been determined 
customers under software maintenance agreements are entitled to receive updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis 
in the event specific features  entitlements or release number of an upgrade or new product have been announced but not delivered  and customers will receive that upgrade or new product as part of a current software maintenance contract  a specified upgrade is deemed created and product revenues are deferred on purchases made after the announcement date until delivery of the upgrade or new product 
the amount and elements to be deferred are dependent on whether the company has established vsoe of fair value for the upgrade or new product 
vsoe of fair value of these upgrades or new products is established based upon the price set by management 
we have a history of selling these upgrades or new products on a stand alone basis 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent with the sale of these elements on a stand alone basis 
this could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
capitalized software development costs costs related to r d are generally charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization of material development costs of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when our products technological feasibility has been established  which is at the earlier of completion of a detailed product design or a working model  and ending when the product is available for general release  in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed fas no 

judgment is required in determining when 
table of contents technological feasibility of a product is established 
changes in judgment as to when technological feasibility is established  or changes in our business  including our go to market strategy  would likely materially impact the amount of costs capitalized 
for example  if the length of time between technological feasibility and general availability is less in the future  the amount of costs capitalized would likely decrease 
in addition  our r d expenses and amounts capitalized as software development costs may not be comparable to our peer companies due to differences in judgment as to when a detailed product design or a working model has been completed or differences in judgment regarding when the product is available for general release 
fas no 
requires annual amortization expense of capitalized software development costs to be the greater of the amounts computed using the ratio of current gross revenue to a products total current and anticipated revenues  or the straight line method over the product s remaining estimated economic life 
to date  we have amortized these costs using the straight line method as it is the greater of the two amounts 
the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors such as anticipated future revenue  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
changes in the periods over which we actually generate revenues or the amounts of revenues generated could result in materially different amounts of amortization 
amounts capitalized under fas no 
are primarily related to salaries and stock based compensation of our employees 
because of the significant judgment necessary in applying fas no 
 our internal measurements of performance  including our cash bonus programs  are based on results excluding the net effect of amounts capitalized and amortized pursuant to fas no 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  other intangible assets  and goodwill 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable are evaluated based upon the creditworthiness of our customers  historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate 
other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period during which the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
our goodwill valuation is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis considers estimated revenue and expense growth rates 
the estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  considering customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
accounting for income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  management judgment is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 

table of contents the amount of income tax we pay is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we do not provide for a us income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the earnings of non us subsidiaries  which reflect full provision for non us income taxes  are indefinitely reinvested in non us operations or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax 
income taxes are calculated on a separate tax return basis  although we are included in the consolidated tax return of emc 
the difference between the income taxes payable that is calculated on a separate return basis and the amount actually paid to emc pursuant to our tax sharing agreement with emc is presented as a component of additional paid in capital 
new accounting pronouncements we adopted financial accounting standards fas no 
 fair value measurements fas no 
on january  fas no 
defines fair value  establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements 
the adoption of fas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp fas no 
 which delays the effective date of fas no 
from to for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
although we will continue to evaluate the application of fas  we do not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r 
this statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
we adopted fas no 
r  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the impact of the standard on our financial position and results of operation will be dependent upon the number of and magnitude of acquisitions that are consummated subsequent to adoption 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas no 

the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and therefore deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
fas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued a new position on fas no 
titled determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
it amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intent is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized 
table of contents intangible asset under fas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fas no 
r  business combinations  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
this position is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 accounting for defensive intangible assets eitf 
eitf applies to defensive intangible assets  which are acquired intangible assets that the acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them 
as these assets are separately identifiable  eitf requires an acquiring entity to account for defensive intangible assets as a separate unit of accounting 
defensive intangible assets must be recognized at fair value in accordance with fas no 
r and fas no 
eitf is effective for defensive intangible assets acquired in fiscal years beginning on or after december  the impact of the standard on our financial position and results of operation will be dependent upon the type of acquisitions that are consummated subsequent to adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk international revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars and the vast majority of our purchase contracts are denominated in us dollars 
a portion of our cost of revenues  primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  and a portion of our operating expenses related to sales and sales support and research and development  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the indian rupee  and the japanese yen 
these costs and the resulting effect on operating income are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
upon consolidation  as exchange rates vary  operating expenses may differ materially from expectations 
for example  the amount of our operating lease commitments may fluctuate in response to changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies as several of our operating leases are payable in foreign currencies 
we do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation 
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  operating income was negatively impacted by million in  million in and million in based upon planned spending in  if the dollar weakened by in in relation to the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen  the indian rupee  the australian dollar  and the canadian dollar  this would result in additional expense of approximately million 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to the variable interest obligation on the note we incurred to fund an million dividend to emc corporation 
the dividend was declared in april  but given retroactive effect as of december  the note may be repaid  without penalty  at any time 
subsequent to receiving the proceeds from our ipo in august  we repaid million of principal on the note 
no repayments of principal were made during the note matures in april and bears an interest rate of the day libor plus basis points  with interest payable quarterly in arrears 
the interest rate on the note resets quarterly and is determined on the two business days prior to the first day of each fiscal quarter 
the interest rate on the note payable as of december  was  and the weighted average interest rate on the note payable for was 
we expect our interest expense on the note payable to decrease in the first quarter of as a result of an approximately basis point decrease in the first quarter interest rate from the rate used in the fourth quarter of if the interest rate on the note payable were to change basis points from the december  rate and assuming no payments on the principal were made during  our annual interest expense would change by million
