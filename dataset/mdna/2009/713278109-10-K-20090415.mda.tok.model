our net loss per share for the fiscal year ended january  was per share or a per share improvement over the loss per share recorded in fiscal year see results of operations 
in addition we continued our real estate monetization program by completing additional sale leaseback transactions on properties in the first half of fiscal year for net proceeds of  the proceeds from these transactions were used to further reduce overall indebtedness  to satisfy our obligation under the master operating lease and for other capital expenditures 
capital liquidity capital resources and needs our cash requirements arise principally from the purchase of inventory  capital expenditures related to existing and new stores  offices and distribution centers  debt service and contractual obligations 

table of contents cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts  accessories and services is our primary source of liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities was  in fiscal year while net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the  decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulted from a  increase in our net loss net of non cash adjustments  and  in unfavorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an unfavorable change in merchandise inventory of  the inventory change is a result of our decision to exit certain non core inventory in the fiscal year compounded by a decision to expand our hard parts assortment in fiscal year the change in accounts payable of  was primarily attributable to the timing of our accounts payable cycle

we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements and generally our open purchase orders orders that have not been shipped are not binding agreements 
those purchase obligations that are in transit from our vendors at january  are considered to be a commercial commitment 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a commercial commitment to purchase approximately  of products over a six year period 
the commitment for years two through five is approximately per year  while the final year s commitment is approximately half that amount 
following year two  we are obligated to pay the vendor a per unit fee if there is a shortfall between our cumulative purchases during the two year period and the minimum purchase requirement

long term debt senior secured term loan facility due october  on january  we entered into a  senior secured term loan facility due january  this facility is secured by a collateral pool consisting of real property and improvements associated with our stores  which is adjusted periodically based upon real estate values and borrowing levels 
interest at the rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus on this facility was payable starting in february proceeds from this facility were used to satisfy and discharge our then outstanding  medium term notes due march  and  term enhanced remarketable securities terms due july  and to reduce borrowings under our line of credit by approximately on october   we amended and restated the senior secured term loan facility to i increase the size from  to  ii extend the maturity from january  to october  and iii reduce the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
proceeds were used to satisfy and discharge  in outstanding convertible senior notes due june  on february   we further amended the senior secured term loan facility to reduce the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
on november   we sold the land and buildings for owned properties to an independent third party 
we used  of the net proceeds to prepay a portion of the senior secured term loan facility 
this prepayment reduced the principal amount of the facility to  and reduced the scheduled quarterly repayments from  to  in addition the prepayment resulted in the recognition in interest expense of approximately  of deferred financing fees and the reclassification from other comprehensive loss for the portion of the related interest rate swap that is no longer designated as a hedge 
as of january   the number of stores which collateralize the senior secured term loan was reduced to properties 
the outstanding balance under the term loan at the end of fiscal year was  the  decline in the outstanding balance was due to quarterly principal payments and an additional payment to release a store from the collateral pool to allow it to be sold to an unrelated third party 
senior subordinated notes due december  on december   we issued  aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due december  during fiscal year the company repurchased notes in the principal amount of  with a portion of the net proceeds generated from the sale leaseback transactions on stores 
on january  the outstanding balance of these notes was revolving credit agreement due december  on december   we further amended our then existing amended and restated line of credit agreement 
the amendment increased the amount available for borrowings to  with an ability  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  to increase such amount to  the amendment also reduced the interest rate under the agreement to libor plus after june   the rate decreased to libor plus  subject to incremental increases as excess 
table of contents availability falls below 
the amendment also provided the flexibility  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  to release up to  of reserves required as of december  under the line of credit agreement to support certain operating leases 
finally  the amendment extended the term of the agreement through december the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit agreement was at february  on january   the company terminated this revolving credit agreement and recognized in interest expense  due to the accelerated write off of related unamortized deferred financing costs 
revolving credit agreement due december  on january   we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with available borrowings up to  our ability to borrow under the revolving credit agreement is based on a specific borrowing base consisting of inventory and accounts receivable 
total incurred fees of  were capitalized and will be amortized over the year life of the facility 
the interest rate on this credit line is libor or prime plus to based upon the then current availability under the facility 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowing under the facility was at january  fees based on the unused portion of the facility range from to basis points 
as of january   current borrowings under the facility were  the weighted average interest rate on borrowings during the fiscal years and were and  respectively 
other notes during fiscal year  notes payable with aggregate principal balances of  and a weighted average interest rates of at february  were paid in full 
other matters several of our debt agreements require compliance with covenants 
the most restrictive of these requirements is contained in our revolving credit agreement 
during any period the availability under the revolving credit agreement drops below  we are required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  of at least  calculated as the ratio of a ebitda net income plus interest charges  provision for taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  non cash stock compensation expenses and other non recurring  non cash items minus capital expenditures and income taxes paid to b the sum of debt service charges and restricted payments made 
the failure to satisfy this covenant would constitute an event of default under the revolving credit agreement  which would result in a cross default under our senior subordinated notes and senior secured term loan 
as of january   the company had additional availability under the revolving credit agreement of approximately  and was in compliance with its financial covenants 
other contractual obligations in the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a vendor financing program with an availability of  under this program  our factor made accelerated and discounted payments to our vendors and we  in turn  made our regularly scheduled full vendor payments to the factor

the surety bonds guarantee certain of our payments for example utilities  easement repairs  licensing requirements and customs fees 
off balance sheet arrangements in the third quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a  operating lease for certain operating equipment at an interest rate of libor plus 
we have evaluated this transaction in accordance with the guidance of financial accounting standards board interpretation number fin and re evaluated the transaction under fin r and have determined that the company is not required to consolidate the leasing entity 
as of january   there was an outstanding commitment of  under the lease 
the lease includes a residual value guarantee with a maximum value of approximately  we expect the fair market value of the leased equipment to substantially reduce or eliminate our payment under the residual guarantee at the end of the lease term 
in accordance with fin  we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the guarantee related to this operating lease 
as of january  and february   the current value of this liability was  and  respectively  which is recorded in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we lease certain property and equipment under operating leases and lease financings which contain renewal and escalation clauses  step rent provisions  capital improvements funding and other lease concessions 
these provisions are considered in the calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  as amended by sfas no  any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 
total operating lease commitments as of january  were  pension and retirement plans we have a defined benefit pension plan covering our full time employees hired on or before february  the company also has a supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
this unfunded plan has a defined benefit component that provides key employees designated by the board of directors with retirement and death benefits 
retirement benefits are based on salary and bonuses  death benefits are based on salary 
benefits paid to a participant under the defined pension plan are deducted from the benefits otherwise payable under the defined benefit portion of the serp 
on january   we amended and restated our serp 
this amendment converted the defined benefit portion of the serp to a defined contribution portion for certain unvested participants and all future participants 
on december  the company terminated the defined benefit portion of the serp with a  payment and recorded a  charge in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
the expense under these plans for fiscal years   and was   and  respectively 
the fiscal year pension expense includes a serp settlement charge of  pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an 
table of contents expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of 
in developing the expected return on asset assumptions  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations 
the discount rate utilized for the pension plans is based on a model bond portfolio with durations that match the expected payment patterns of the plans 
we continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions and make adjustments as necessary for the existing plans 
in fiscal year  we contributed an aggregate of  to our pension plans to fund the retirement obligations and for the termination of the defined benefit portion of the serp 
based upon the current funded status of the defined benefit pension plan  we do not expect to make any cash contributions in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans 
results of operations the following discussion explains the material changes in our results of operations for the fifty two weeks ended january   the fifty two weeks ended february  and fifty three weeks ended february  discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal year  we adopted our long term strategic plan 
one of the initial steps in this plan was the identification of low return stores for closure 
we have accounted for these store closures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and sfas no  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no  our discontinued operations for all periods presented reflect the operating results for of the closed stores because we do not believe that the customers of these stores are likely to become customers of other pep boys stores due to geographical considerations 
the operating results for the other closed stores are included in continuing operations because we believe that the customers of these stores are likely to become customers of other pep boys stores that are in close proximity 
the following analysis of our results of continuing operations excludes the operating results of the above referenced stores which have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

table of contents analysis of statement of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues except as otherwise provided and the percentage change in dollar amounts of such items compared to the indicated prior period

table of contents fiscal year vs 
fiscal year total revenues for fiscal year decreased to  compared to  for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to weaker sales in our retail business stemming from lower customer counts and the de emphasis of non core automotive merchandise 
comparable revenues decreased by  consisting of an decrease in comparable merchandise sales and a decrease in comparable service revenue 
upon reaching its th month of operation  a store is added to our comparable sales store base 
stores are removed from the comparable sales store base upon their relocation or closure 
once a relocated store reaches its th month of operation at its new location  it is added back into our comparable sales store base 
square footage increases are infrequent and immaterial and  accordingly are not considered in our calculations of comparable sales data 
in late fiscal year and the first half of fiscal year  as part of our long term strategic plan  we rebalanced our inventory through an aggressive mark down and sell through program of non core and unproductive merchandise in order to allow us to allocate a larger portion of our inventory investment to core automotive merchandise 
this action was taken because our core automotive merchandise  which is utilized in each of our lines of business diy and difm carries a higher gross product margin  requires less promotional activity and communicates to our customers our commitment to fulfilling all of their automotive aftermarket needs 
merchandise sales declined in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of our decision to exit non core and unproductive products and lower customer counts 
customer counts continued to decline in fiscal year due to increased competition as our competitors continued to open more stores  the overall industry decline in the diy business and as the result of challenging macroeconomic factors 
higher interest rates  energy costs and gas prices resulted in less discretionary income and resulted in a reduction in miles driven in the usa as compared to the prior year 
we believe that less discretionary income coupled with fewer miles driven resulted in fewer purchases of automotive accessories and the deferral of automotive maintenance 
fewer miles driven results in less wear and tear on vehicles  which in turn results in fewer sales of automotive parts and automotive maintenance and repair services 
due to the changing macroeconomic conditions  future trends in consumer confidence  disposable income and miles driven are uncertainties that could impact future results 
to address these sales and customer count declines  we are i improving store execution by providing additional associate sales and technical training  ii increasing service center productivity by transitioning to performance based pay compensation programs  iii utilizing more impactful targeted marketing through a variety of media platforms  iv offering our customers a broader selection of tires and hard parts and v focusing on providing fast  expert customer service 
we believe that providing a better customer experience  value proposition and marketing will stem the decline in customer counts and sales over the long term 
gross profit from merchandise sales increased  as a percentage of merchandise sales  to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in dollars was  or a decrease from the prior year 
the prior year included an inventory impairment charge of  and a  asset impairment charge resulting from the closure of stores 
included in the current year is an asset and inventory impairment charge of  the asset impairment charge was primarily for certain closed locations as a result of the decline in real estate values and the inventory impairment charge was due to our temporarily restricting certain small engine merchandise for sale that is the subject of an ongoing epa inquiry 
excluding these adjustments from both years  gross profit as a percent of merchandise sales increased from in fiscal year to in the current year 
in dollars  merchandise gross profit decreased  or primarily due to reduced merchandise sales 
a further breakdown of our gross profit from merchandise sales excluding the items mentioned above is as follows our product gross margins improved by basis points to

these improvements were partially offset by increased occupancy costs of basis points as a result of increased rental obligations stemming from the sale leaseback transactions

the decline in sales volume resulted in reduced leverage of fixed expenses such as occupancy costs and to a certain extent labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year  however total selling general and administrative expenses declined by  or over the prior year 
this decrease in dollars was the result of expense control initiatives  with major reductions in compensation and compensation related benefits of  and lower media expense of  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
net gain from disposition of assets decreased  as a percentage of total revenue  to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the  decrease resulted from the decline in the immediate recognition of gain on the sale leaseback transactions that were completed in the prior year as compared to those completed in the current year 
interest expense decreased  or to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year primarily due to reduced debt levels as a result of applying proceeds from our sale leaseback transactions 
included in fiscal are a gain of  due to debt repurchases and a  charge for deferred financing costs related to our previous credit facility 
fiscal year includes a  charge for deferred financing costs resulting from the repayment of  of our senior secured term loan facility and the reclassification from other comprehensive loss for the portion of the related interest rate swap that is no longer designated as a hedge 
excluding these adjustments  interest expense declined by  or 
non operating income as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this decrease of  was due to lower investment balances in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year loss from discontinued operations was  in fiscal year versus  in fiscal year fiscal years and included impairment charges of  and  respectively due to store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our income tax benefit as a percentage of loss from continuing operations before income taxes was or  for fiscal versus or  for fiscal year the decline in the effective rate was due to the non deductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes  the recognition of a gain for tax on the surrender of life insurance policies and the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and credits

the decrease in product margins resulted from recording a  inventory impairment charge associated with the markdown and discontinuance of certain non core products as part of our longer term strategic plan 
occupancy costs increased by  primarily due to the impairment charges of  related to the stores identified for closure that operated as clearance centers during the fourth quarter and rent expense increased by  primarily related to the change in fair value of the cash flow hedge associated with variable lease payments on certain stores  partially offset by lower equipment rental

industry comparison we operate in the us automotive aftermarket  which has two general lines of business the do it for me difm service labor  installed merchandise and tires market and the do it yourself diy retail merchandise market 
generally  the specialized automotive retailers focus on either the diy or difm areas of the business 
we believe that operation in both the diy and difm areas of the business positively differentiates us from most of our competitors 
although we manage our store performance at a store level in aggregation  we believe that the following presentation shows an accurate comparison against competitors within the two sales arenas 
we compete in the diy area of the business through our retail sales floor and commercial sales business retail sales 
our service center business labor and installed merchandise and tires competes in the difm area of the industry 
the following table presents the revenues and gross profit for each area of the business 
fiscal year ended dollar amounts in thousands january  february  february  retail sales service center revenue total revenues gross profit from retail sales gross profit from service center revenue total gross profit excludes revenues from installed products 
includes revenues from installed products 
gross profit from retail sales includes the cost of products sold  buying  warehousing and store occupancy costs 
gross profit from service center revenue includes the cost of installed products sold  buying  warehousing  service center payroll and related employee benefits and service center occupancy costs 
occupancy costs include utilities  rents  real estate and property taxes  repairs and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses 

table of contents effects of inflation we use the lifo method of inventory valuation 
thus  the cost of merchandise sold approximates current cost 
although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on revenues or results of operations during all fiscals years presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns and warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring costs  retirement benefits  share based compensation  risk participation agreements and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  although not all inclusive inventory is stated at the lower of cost as determined under lifo or market in the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and current market conditions 
in addition  historically we have been able to return excess items to vendors for credit 
future changes in vendors  in their policies or in their willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require a revision in the estimates 
if our estimates regarding excess or obsolete inventory are inaccurate  we may incur losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in these estimates at january  would have affected net loss by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  we have risk participation arrangements with respect to casualty and health care insurance  including the maintaining of stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
a reserve for the liabilities associated with these agreements is established using generally accepted actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
the amounts included in our costs related to these arrangements are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions  claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at january  would have affected net loss by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  we record reserves for future product returns  warranty claims and inventory shrinkage 
the reserves are based on expected returns of products and historical claims and inventory shrinkage experience 
if actual experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required 
a change in these reserves at january  would have affected net loss by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents we have significant pension costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and merit and promotion increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant change in assumption impact on annual pension expense impact on projected benefit obligation percentage point decrease in discount rate increase  increase  percentage point increase in discount rate decrease  decrease  percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets increase  percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets decrease  we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments are based on market and operating conditions at the time of evaluation 
future events could cause management s conclusion on impairment to change  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we have a share based compensation plan  which includes stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus 
we account for our share based compensation plans as prescribed by the fair value provisions of sfas no

we determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the rsus are awarded at a price equal to the market price of our underlying stock on the date of the grant 
the pricing model and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include the expected life of stock options  expected stock price volatility  future employee stock option exercise behaviors and the estimate of award forfeitures 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are different from these assumptions  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
in addition  significant changes in these assumptions could materially impact our share based compensation expense on future awards 
a change in our share based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended january  would have affected net loss by approximately  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal and state tax laws and regulations currently in effect  some of which have been recently revised 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our state income tax expense and our state income taxes paid  which could have a material effect on our net earnings loss 
at any one time our tax returns for many tax years are subject to examination by us federal  foreign  and state taxing jurisdictions

table of contents accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
we adjust these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases  and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent our actual tax liability differs from our established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  our effective tax rate may be materially impacted 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of  the timing of  or the tax treatment of any particular tax position or deduction  we believe that our tax balances reflect the more likely than not outcome of known tax contingencies 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in this regard when determining whether or not we should establish a valuation allowance  the company considers various tax planning strategies  including potential real estate transactions  as future taxable income 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods from either operations or projected tax planning strategies 
we had net deferred tax assets of  and  as of january  and february   respectively
