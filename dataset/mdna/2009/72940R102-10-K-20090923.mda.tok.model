we received  from grants from the ocs during the year ended june  recently  a grant in an amount of million was approved for participation in r d expenses for the period march to february in august we received  on account of the approved grant 
while most of our capital resources are denominated by us dollars  about half of our expenses are denominated by nis 
over the past year  due to the increased volatility of the us dollar  we began using foreign currency forward contracts 
we continue to actively utilize currency hedging transactions to manage our exposure 
outlook we do not expect to generate any revenues from sales of products in the next twelve months 
we may generate revenues from sale of licenses to use our technology or products 
our products will likely not be ready for sale for at least three years  if at all 
the ocs has supported our activity in the past three years 
our application for a fourth year s grant was submitted in march recently  the ocs approved a grant in an amount of million for participation in r d expenses for the period march to february we believe that the funds we have  together with the approved r d grant  will be sufficient for operating until march our independent registered public accounting firm s report states that there is a substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern 
management believes that we will need to raise additional funds before we have any cash flow from operations 
we are looking constantly for sources of funding  including non diluting funds  such as the ocs grants and filing grant applications with the us national institutes of health  which we have done recently 
there can be no assurance that we will receive this grant 
in addition  we plan to raise additional funds by issuance of equity 
if we are unable to obtain the financing necessary to support our operations  we may need to take measures to reduce our operating costs  or  if such measures will not be sufficient  we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
in that event  we may be forced to cease operations and our stockholders could lose their entire investment in the company 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
we believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our consolidated financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated income statements 
we recognize compensation expenses for the value of its awards  which have graded vesting based on the accelerated method over the requisite service period of each of the awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are  expected stock price volatility  and the expected option term 
expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date 
the expected life of options granted is calculated using the simplified method  as defined in staff accounting bulletin  or sab no 
 share based payments  or sab no 
 as the average between the vesting period and the contractual life of the options 
on december  the sec staff issued sab no 
 or sab  which  effective january   amends and replaces sab no 
we currently use the simplified method  as adequate historical experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate 
we adopted sab effective january  and will continue to apply the simplified method until enough historical experience is available to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term for stock option grants 
we have historically not paid dividends and has no foreseeable plans to issue dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield from us treasury zero coupon bonds with an equivalent term 
the expected annual pre vesting forfeiture rate affects the number of exercisable options 
based on our historical experience  the annual pre vesting forfeiture rate is 
the assumptions below are relevant to restricted shares granted in in accordance with sfas no 
r  restricted shares are measured at their fair value as if they were vested and issued on the grant date 
all restricted shares to employees and non employees granted in were granted for no consideration  therefore their fair value was equal to the share price at the date of grant 
the fair value of all restricted shares was determined based on the close trading price of our shares known at the grant date 
we apply sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  with respect to options and warrants issued to non employees 
sfas r requires the use of option valuation models to measure the fair value of the options and warrants at the measurement date
