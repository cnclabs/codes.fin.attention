item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in as a successor to businesses that had been engaged in providing construction services since we provide diversified general contracting  construction management and design build services to private clients and public agencies throughout the world 
our construction business is conducted through three basic segments or operations building  civil and management services 
our building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialized building markets  including the hospitality and gaming  healthcare  municipal offices  sports and entertainment  educational  transportation  corrections  biotech  pharmaceutical and high tech markets  and electrical and mechanical  plumbing and hvac services 
our civil segment specializes in public works construction and the repair  replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure  including highways  bridges  mass transit systems and water and wastewater treatment facilities  primarily in the western  northeastern and mid atlantic united states 
our management services segment provides diversified construction and design build services to the u 
s 
military and federal government agencies  as well as surety companies and multi national corporations in the united states and overseas 
we have been chosen by the federal government for significant projects related to defense and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan 
the contracting and management services that we provide consist of general contracting  pre construction planning and comprehensive management services  including planning and scheduling the manpower  equipment  materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms and specifications contained in a construction contract 
we also offer self performed construction services including site work  concrete forming and placement  steel erection  electrical and mechanical  plumbing and hvac 
we provide these services by using traditional general contracting arrangements  such as fixed price  guaranteed maximum price and cost plus fee contracts and  to a lesser extent  construction management or design build contracting arrangements 
in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into arrangements with other contractors  referred to as joint ventures  for certain construction projects 
each of the joint venture participants is usually committed to supply a predetermined percentage of capital  as required  and to share in a predetermined percentage of the income or loss of the project 
generally  each joint venture participant is fully liable for the obligations of the joint venture 
for the year ended december   we achieved record revenues of billion 
it was the third consecutive year that we have achieved record revenues 
due to recognition of a million pretax impairment charge relating to goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a loss from construction operations of million and a net loss of million 
had we not been required to record the impairment charge in  we would have achieved a record for income from construction operations and net income for the third consecutive year 
we received significant new contract awards  as well as additions to contracts in place  during and ended the year with a contract backlog of billion 
on september   we completed a merger with tutor saliba which added million to our revenues 
at december   we had working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to  and a ratio of long term debt to equity of to 
our stockholders equity increased to billion as of december   reflecting the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock in connection with the merger with tutor saliba and the outstanding operating results achieved in  offset by the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge recognized 
recent developments acquisition of keating building company on january   we completed the acquisition of keating building company  a philadelphia based privately held construction  construction management and design build company  with anticipated fiscal year revenues of approximately million and a backlog of million 
under the terms of the transaction  we acquired of keating s common stock for million in cash plus an amount to be determined based on fiscal through operating results  not to exceed million 
keating is licensed to provide construction services in a number of states  mostly in the mid atlantic region 
we believe that the acquisition of keating is a strong strategic fit that will enable us to expand our building construction market presence in the eastern half of the united states  including the important northeast and mid atlantic regions  and to realize significant synergies from the acquisition by deploying keating s resources in the regional gaming  hospitality and public works building markets in the eastern united states 
the results of operations for keating will be included in our financial statements beginning in the first quarter of common stock repurchase program on november   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock over the ensuing twelve months 
under the terms of the program  we may repurchase shares in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions 
we expect to use cash on hand to fund repurchases of our common stock 
stock repurchases will be conducted in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the timing and amount of any repurchase will be based on our evaluation of market conditions  business considerations and other factors 
repurchases also may be made under rule b plans  which would permit common stock to be purchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws 
the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock  and the program may be extended  modified  suspended or discontinued at any time  at our discretion 
during  we repurchased  shares for an aggregate purchase price of million under the program 
merger with tutor saliba corporation on september   we completed a merger with tutor saliba pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger between us  tutor saliba  ronald n 
tutor and shareholders of tutor saliba 
in connection with the merger  we issued  shares of our common stock to the shareholders of tutor saliba in exchange for of the outstanding capital stock of tutor saliba 
we merged with tutor saliba because we believe it is a strong strategic fit  providing us with enhanced opportunities for growth not available to us on a stand alone basis through increased size  scale and management capabilities  complementary assets and expertise  particularly tutor saliba s expertise in civil projects  immediate access to multiple geographic regions  and increased ability to compete for larger numbers of projects particularly in the civil construction segment due to an increased bonding capacity 
the merger enabled mr 
tutor to focus his management efforts entirely on the growth and development of the company 
as a result of the merger  the financial interests in construction joint ventures held individually by perini and tutor saliba prior to the merger are now owned by us 
our operating results for the year ended december  include the operating results of tutor saliba from the date of acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
amended credit facility effective september   we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america 
the credit agreement allows us to borrow up to million on a revolving credit basis  with a million sublimit for letters of credit  and an additional million at december  under a supplementary facility the supplementary facility to the extent that the million base facility has been fully drawn 
subject to certain conditions  we have the option to increase the base facility by up to an additional million 
the total amount available to borrow under the supplementary facility reduces upon the sale of all or any portion of the million face value of auction rate securities held in our investment portfolio as of september  subsequent to september   we have sold auction rate securities with a face value in the amount of million 
this supplementary facility provides us with access to an additional source of liquidity 
on february   the credit agreement was amended  effective december   to modify certain financial covenants to accommodate the impact of the million impairment charge recorded in and to extend the maturity date of the supplementary facility to december  for a description of additional material terms of the credit agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
grant of restricted stock units and stock options during  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the grant of  restricted stock units and  nonqualified stock options to certain employees and directors under our stock option and incentive plan 
we recognized total stock based compensation expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively  relating to stock based compensation awards 
we had approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards at december  which  absent significant forfeitures  is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
backlog analysis for our backlog of uncompleted construction work at december  was approximately billion  as compared to the billion at december  the new business awarded in amount includes approximately billion of backlog  before elimination of intercompany amounts  added due to the merger with tutor saliba 
the following table provides an analysis of our backlog by business segment for the year ended december  backlog at new business revenue backlog at december  awarded recognized december  in millions building civil management services total new business awarded consists of the original contract price of projects added to our backlog plus or minus subsequent changes to the estimated total contract price of existing contracts 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our construction business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts and our joint venture contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our projects  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that the method of accounting for contracts is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements and estimating potential liabilities in conjunction with certain contingencies  including the outcome of pending or future litigation  arbitration or other dispute resolution proceedings relating to contract claims see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow us to produce materially reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability of skilled contract labor  the performance of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of major subcontractors  unusual weather conditions and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have many contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other without impacting overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex construction projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue on contracts relating to unapproved change orders and claims  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount of costs incurred by us to date for contract price adjustments that we seek to collect from customers for delays  errors in specifications or designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to scope or price  or other unanticipated additional costs  in each case when recovery of the costs is considered probable 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
the settlement of these issues may take years depending upon whether the item can be resolved directly with the customer or involves litigation or arbitration 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
the amount of unapproved change order and claim revenue is included in our balance sheet as part of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
the amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings relating to unapproved change orders and claims included in our balance sheet at december  and is summarized below december  in thousands unapproved change orders claims of the balance of unapproved change orders and claims included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings at december  and december   approximately million and million respectively  are amounts subject to pending litigation or dispute resolution proceedings as described in item  legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements for the respective periods 
these amounts are management s estimate of the probable cost recovery from the disputed claims considering such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
in the event that future facts and circumstances  including the resolution of disputed claims  cause us to reduce the aggregate amount of our estimated probable cost recovery from the disputed claims  we will record the amount of such reduction against earnings in the relevant future period 
method of accounting for contracts revenues and profits from our contracts and construction joint venture contracts are recognized by applying percentages of completion for the period to the total estimated profits for the respective contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of the work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contracts 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is recorded during the accounting period in which it is estimated 
in the ordinary course of business  at a minimum on a quarterly basis  we prepare updated estimates of the total forecasted revenue  cost and profit or loss for each contract 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of the total forecasted revenue and costs  including unapproved change orders and claims  during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision become known 
the financial impact of these revisions to any one contract is a function of both the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract 
an amount equal to the costs incurred that are attributable to unapproved change orders and claims is included in the total estimated revenue when realization is probable 
for a further discussion of unapproved change orders and claims  see item  business types of contracts and the contract process and item a  risk factors 
profit from unapproved change orders and claims is recorded in the accounting period such amounts are resolved 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents the excess of contract billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over contract billings to date 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings results when the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion accounting method  but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract and or costs  recorded at estimated realizable value  related to unapproved change orders or claims are incurred 
for unapproved change orders or claims that cannot be resolved in accordance with the normal change order process as defined in the contract  we may employ other dispute resolution methods  including mediation  binding and non binding arbitration  or litigation 
see item legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the prerequisite for billing unapproved change orders and claims is the final resolution and agreement between the parties 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings related to our contracts and joint venture contracts at december  is discussed above under use of estimates and in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  primarily trade names and contractor license  for impairment by applying a fair value test in the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets should be evaluated 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when testing goodwill  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities and calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment charge equals the excess of the carrying value of goodwill  if any  over the implied fair value of goodwill 
to determine the fair value of the reporting unit  we primarily use the income approach which is based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future 
this income valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
we also use the market valuation method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing industry multiples of operating earnings 
when calculating impairment for intangible assets with indefinite lives  we compare the fair value of these assets as determined by the income valuation method to the carrying value 
the impairment charge equals the excess of the carrying value of the asset  if any  over its fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded goodwill and intangible asset pretax impairment charges totaling million million after taxes 
the impairment charges were due to degradation in the timing of cash flows caused by delays  postponements and reduction in scope of certain projects that we were anticipating to enter into backlog in or  exacerbated by the global economic conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of no impairment charges were recorded in and fair value measurements we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas effective january  relating to financial instruments 
we determined that we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities  valued at million as of december  all of these instruments are classified as available for sale securities as of december  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of december  in addition  we obtained an independent valuation of most of our auction rate security instruments and considered these valuations in determining the estimated fair values of the auction rate securities in our portfolio 
our analyses considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to full par value 
in conjunction with our estimates of fair value at december   we recorded a million pretax impairment charge in of this million impairment charge  million was deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
the million balance of the impairment charge was deemed to be temporary thereby resulting in a charge to stockholders equity 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
share based compensation we have granted restricted stock units and stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after june  in accordance with sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award which corresponds to the vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock option awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock option awards and the expected volatility of our stock price over the life of the awards 
we used the black scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards  and utilized the historical volatility of our common stock as a reasonable estimate of the future volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the awards 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change which require the use of different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  sfas r requires us to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded through december  insurance liabilities we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of the losses and liabilities primarily associated with workers compensation and general liability coverage 
in addition  on certain projects  we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of losses that arise from any subcontractor defaults 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
the estimate of our insurance liability within our self insured deductible limits includes an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on data compiled from historical experience 
actual experience could differ significantly from these estimates and could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we purchase varying levels of insurance from third parties  including excess liability insurance  to cover losses in excess of our self insured deductible limits 
currently  our self insured deductible limit for workers compensation and general liability coverage is generally million per occurrence and our maximum self insured deductible limit for subcontractor default on projects covered under our program is million per occurrence 
accounting for income taxes information relating to our provision for income taxes and the status of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented in note  income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a key assumption in the determination of our book tax provision is the amount of the valuation allowance  if any  required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transitions 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  there was no impact on our total liabilities or stockholders equity 
we identified and reviewed potential tax uncertainties in accordance with fin and determined that the exposure to those uncertainties did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as of december  defined benefit retirement plan the status of our defined benefit pension plan obligations  related plan assets and cost is presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled employee benefit plans 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions which include  among other things  the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
the discount rate of used for purposes of computing the annual pension expense was determined at the beginning of the calendar year based upon an analysis performed by our actuaries which matches the cash flows of our plan s projected liabilities to bond investments of similar amounts and durations 
we plan to change the discount rate used for computing the annual pension expense to based upon a similar analysis by our actuaries 
the estimated return on plan assets is primarily based on historical long term returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our targeted allocation of plan assets equity and fixed income 
we plan to continue to use a return on asset rate of in based on projected equity and bond market performance compared to long term historical averages 
the plans benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets on december    and accordingly  we adjusted our accrued pension liability by an increase of million in  and by decreases of million in and million in  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  an increase reduction in stockholders equity 
effective june   all benefit accruals under our pension plan were frozen  however  the vested benefit was preserved 
due to the expected increase in amortization of prior years investment losses  we anticipate that pension expense will increase from million in to million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan are anticipated to be approximately million in cash contributions may vary significantly in the future depending upon asset performance and the interest rate environment 
results of operations compared to in  revenues increased by  million to a record  million and gross profit increased by million 
income from construction operations decreased by million  from a profit of million to a loss of million  and net income decreased by million  from a profit of million to a loss of million  due to the recognition of a million pretax non cash impairment charge relating to goodwill and other intangible assets 
had we not had to record the impairment charge in  we would have achieved a record for income from construction operations and net income for the third consecutive year 
excluding the non cash impairment charge  our strong performance in was led by our building and management services segments 
in addition  our civil segment returned to profitability in the increase in revenues and profit before the impairment charge primarily reflects the conversion of our substantial building segment backlog into revenues and profit as expected and the impact of the merger with tutor saliba 
revenues for the year ended december  increase change in millions building civil management services total overall revenues increased by  million or  from  million in to  million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in building construction revenues of million or  from  million in to  million in  primarily as a result of the conversion of our substantial building segment backlog into revenues as expected  led by an increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming  healthcare and office building markets in las vegas and california 
the addition of tutor saliba in september resulted in an increase of million in building construction revenues in civil construction revenues increased by million or  from million to million in  due primarily to the addition of tutor saliba 
management services revenues increased by million or  from million in to million in  due to the addition of tutor saliba s black construction operation in guam and a slightly higher volume of work in iraq 
impact of impairment charge in our income from construction operations was materially impacted by a million pretax impairment charge 
this impairment charge reflects the write down to fair value of goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets initially recorded in connection with our merger with tutor saliba in september the pretax impairment charge related to the indefinite lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill  amounted to a total of million  of which million related to the building segment  million related to the civil segment  and million related to the management services segment 
these indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names and various contractors licenses 
the pretax impairment charge related to goodwill amounted to a total of million  of which million related to the building segment and million related to the management services segment 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible in the fourth quarter of in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in performing this test  we used the income method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
due to the global financial crisis and significant global economic conditions experienced during the fourth quarter of  we have experienced delays  postponements and reductions in scope of certain construction projects that we were anticipating to enter backlog in or as a result of these delays  postponements and reductions in scope  the projected cash flows of the tutor saliba reporting units have decreased considerably from those initially anticipated prior to the completion of the merger  thereby resulting in a lower fair value of the tutor saliba reporting units and a corresponding impairment in the amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets recorded in connection with the merger 
these impairment charges relating to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are non cash and therefore do not affect our cash position  liquidity or have any impact on future operating results 
the following table summarizes by segment the income loss from construction operations before and after the impairment charge 
income loss from construction operations for the increase year ended december  decrease in income change in millions building before impairment charge impairment charge building  net civil before impairment charge impairment charge civil  net management services before impairment charge impairment charge management services  net subtotal before impairment charge impairment charge subtotal  net of impairment charge less corporate total  before impairment charge impairment charge total  net of impairment charge income loss from construction operations  before impairment charge the following discussion of income from construction operations in and has been prepared on a pre impairment charge basis in order to enable users of this information to better compare normal operating results of each segment between the two periods 
since the impairment charge impacts only and does not affect revenues  cost of revenues or general expenses we incur to conduct our day to day construction operations  management believes the following discussion  analysis and comparison of and operating results in more meaningful to users when prepared on a pre impairment charge basis 
building construction income from operations before the impairment charge increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the significant increase in revenues discussed above  including the addition of tutor saliba 
building construction income from operations was reduced by an million increase in building construction related general and administrative expenses  due primarily to increases driven by changes in revenue volume and a million increase resulting from the addition of tutor saliba 
in addition  the increase in building construction related general and administrative expenses included a million increase due to marketing and preconstruction efforts relating to potential projects in dubai  and a million increase in amortization of stock based compensation 
civil construction income from operations before the impairment charge increased by million  from a loss of million in to a profit of million in the addition of tutor saliba made a significant positive impact on the civil construction income from operations along with improved operating results from both our new york civil and cherry hill operations 
the loss in was due primarily to recording a charge with respect to the matter discussed in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
had that charge in not been recorded  the civil construction segment would still have experienced a loss from operations of approximately million due primarily to i downward profit adjustments recorded on a bridge rehabilitation project and on two mass transit projects in metropolitan new york  and ii an increase in civil construction related general and administrative expenses  due primarily to a decrease in the number of active projects  as well as an increase in legal fees relating to open legal matters 
the matter discussed in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements has not been settled 
as a result  the potential for a further charge or credit exists  however  management believes that the amount of such further charge or credit  if any  will not be material to the financial results of the company or of the civil segment 
in conjunction with the increase in revenues discussed above  management services contributed significantly to our income from operations in however  management services income from operations before the impairment charge decreased by million or  from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the extraordinary operating results recorded in due to favorable performance on work in iraq 
overall income from construction operations was favorably impacted by a million decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million decrease in corporate stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in through largely offsetting this decrease were increases in certain outside professional fees related to the audit of our financial statements and an increase in legal fees related to the matters discussed in note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income decreased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the recognition of a million loss due to the adjustment of certain of our investments in auction rate securities to fair value in  and a net loss of million in  as compared to a million net gain in  from the sale of certain parcels of developed land held for sale 
in addition  interest income decreased by million as a result of lower interest rates available on short term cash investments during interest expense increased by million  from million in to million in a reduction in interest expense due to the february repayment of our term loan in full was more than offset by increases in interest expense due to more extensive equipment financing in and to the million of outstanding debt assumed in conjunction with the merger with tutor saliba 
the provision for income taxes decreased by million  from million in to million in for  an effective tax rate of was applied to pretax operating income  excluding the goodwill impairment charge of million which is not tax deductible 
the effective tax rate in was 
results of operations compared to in  revenues increased by  million to a record  million  gross profit increased by million  income from construction operations increased by million  and net income increased by million or to a record million 
our strong performance in was led by our building and management services segments 
the increase in revenues and profit primarily reflects the conversion of our substantial building segment backlog into revenues and profit as expected 
in addition  our management services segment also made a significant contribution to our operating results 
revenues for the year ended december  increase decrease change in millions building civil management services total overall revenues increased by  million or  from  million in to  million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in building construction revenues of  million or  from  million in to  million in  primarily as a result of the conversion of our substantial building segment backlog into revenues as expected  led by an increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming market as a result of the significant new contract awards we received in the latter half of and in civil construction revenues decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the timing of the start up of new work 
management services revenues decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the completion of our nuclear power plant maintenance and modification contract with exelon as of december  and to a lower volume of work in iraq 
income loss from construction operations for the increase year ended december  decrease in income change in millions building civil management services subtotal less corporate total building construction income from operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the significant increase in revenues discussed above 
partly offsetting the increase in gross profit resulting from the increase in revenues was an million increase in building construction related general and administrative expenses related to the significant increase in the volume of work put in place  as well as to a million increased provision for incentive compensation due to the significantly improved building construction operating results  and a million increased charge related to stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in the second quarter of civil construction income from operations decreased by million  from a profit of million in to a loss of million in civil construction income from operations in reflected downward profit adjustments recorded on several projects in the mid atlantic and southeast regions  including a roadway project in maryland  while the loss in was due primarily to recording a charge with respect to the matter discussed in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
had that charge in not been recorded  the civil construction segment would still have experienced a loss from operations of approximately million due primarily to i downward profit adjustments recorded on a bridge rehabilitation project and on two mass transit projects in metropolitan new york  and ii an increase in civil construction related general and administrative expenses  due primarily to a decrease in the number of active projects  as well as an increase in legal fees relating to open legal matters 
despite the decrease in revenues discussed above  management services income from operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to favorable performance on work in iraq which more than offset the decreased profit contribution resulting from the completion of our contract with exelon as of december  overall income from construction operations was favorably impacted by a million decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million decrease in corporate stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in  and partly offsetting this decrease were increases in certain outside consulting fees and a million increase in the provision for corporate incentive compensation due to the significantly improved operating results 
other income increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million increase in interest income as a result of the positive cash flow we generated from operating activities in the latter half of and throughout also  we realized a gain of million in resulting from the sale of a parcel of land used in operations 
in addition  the net gain on sales of parcels of developed land held for sale increased by million in due to higher sales activity 
based on our limited remaining inventory of developed land held for sale and the anticipated selling prices for those parcels  we believe that the net gain recorded in is not indicative of future results 
interest expense decreased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the february  repayment of our term loan in full 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the increase in pretax income in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  the reduction in the effective tax rate is due primarily to a decrease in disallowed tax deductions 
potential impact of current economic conditions current instability of the financial markets in the united states and overseas has made it difficult for certain of our customers  including state and local governments  to access the credit markets to obtain financing or refinancing  as the case may be  to fund new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
state and local governments also are facing potentially significant budget shortfalls as a result of declining tax and other revenues  which may cause them to defer or cancel planned infrastructure projects 
our backlog has decreased in as we have encountered increased levels of deferrals and delays related to anticipated new construction projects  primarily during the fourth quarter of difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets may continue to maintain or increase the rate at which our customers defer  delay  cancel or reduce the scope of proposed new construction projects 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital effective september   we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  as agent 
the credit agreement amends and replaces in its entirety a previously existing credit agreement dated february   as amended on may   and allows us to borrow up to million on a revolving credit basis the revolving facility  with a million sublimit for letters of credit  and an additional million under a supplementary facility the supplementary facility to the extent that the million base facility has been fully drawn 
the total amount available to borrow under the supplementary facility reduces upon the sale of all or any portion of the million face value of auction rate securities held in our investment portfolio as of september  subsequent to september   we have sold auction rate securities with a face value in the amount of million 
this supplementary facility provides us with access to a source of liquidity should the need arise 
on february   the credit agreement was amended  effective december   to modify certain financial covenants to accommodate the impact of the million impairment charge recorded in and to extend the maturity date of the supplementary facility to december  the termination date of the revolving facility is february  we did not borrow under the revolving facility during or we had million available to borrow under the credit agreement at december   including outstanding letters of credit 
for a description of additional material terms of the credit agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held by us as well as our proportionate share of amounts held by construction joint ventures 
cash held by us is available for general corporate purposes while cash held by construction joint ventures is available only for joint venture related uses 
joint venture cash and cash equivalents are not restricted to specific uses within those entities  however  the terms of the joint venture agreements limit our ability to distribute those funds and use them for corporate purposes 
cash held by construction joint ventures is distributed from time to time to us and to the other joint venture participants in accordance with our respective percentage interest after the joint venture partners determine that a cash distribution is prudent 
cash distributions received by us from our construction joint ventures are then available for general corporate purposes 
at december  and december   cash held by us and available for general corporate purposes was million and million  respectively  and our proportionate share of cash held by joint ventures and available only for joint venture related uses was million and million  respectively 
at december  and december   our cash balance included million and million  respectively  which represents an advance received from a project owner to be used to fund subcontract work on a specific project under certain circumstances 
we have included these amounts in our contract billings and they are included as a component of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings in the consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  billing procedures in the construction industry generally are based on the specific billing terms of a contract 
for example  billings may be based on various measures of performance  such as cubic yards excavated  architect s estimates of completion  costs incurred on cost plus type contracts or weighted progress from a cost loaded construction time schedule 
billings are generally on a monthly basis and are reviewed and approved by the customer prior to submission 
therefore  once a bill is submitted  we are generally able to collect amounts owed to us in accordance with the payment terms of the contract 
in addition  receivables of a contractor usually include retentions  or amounts that are held back until contracts are completed or until specified contract conditions or guarantees are met 
retentions are governed by contract provisions and are typically a fixed percentage for example  or of each billing 
we generally follow the policy of paying our vendors and subcontractors on a particular project after we receive payment from our customer 
a summary of cash flows for each of the years ended december   and is set forth below year ended december  in millions cash flows provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
the positive cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to the substantial increase in our building segment revenues as well as favorable operating results in our civil and management services segments 
we used million in cash to fund investing activities  principally the purchase of auction rate securities  corporate aircraft and construction equipment to be used primarily in our civil construction operations  net of a million cash balance recorded in connection with the merger with tutor saliba because the consideration paid in the merger was equity and not cash 
we used million in cash to fund our financing activities  principally million for the repayment of shareholder notes payable assumed in the merger with tutor saliba  million for the repayment of debt  and million for the purchase of common stock in connection with our common stock repurchase program which was instituted in november the debt repayments include million of debt assumed in connection with the merger with tutor saliba 
due to the use of cash in our investing and financing activities  our cash balance deceased by million during during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
the substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities compared to is primarily due to the substantial increase in our building segment revenues as well as favorable operating results in our management services segment 
cash flow from operating activities was partly used to fund million in financing activities  primarily to pay in full the remaining million balance outstanding on our term loan in conjunction with the closing of our new revolving credit facility in february  and to pay down debt assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill  and to partly fund million in investing activities  principally for the purchase of construction equipment and property to be used in support of our building construction operations  and to purchase a net million of auction rate securities for short term investment purposes 
as a result  we increased our cash balance by million during during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
the substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities compared to was primarily due to the substantial increase in our building segment revenues  including the acquisition of rudolph and sletten  as well as favorable operating results in our management services segment 
cash flow from operating activities increased substantially even though included payment of the million wmata judgment recorded in cash flow from operating activities was partly used to fund million in investing activities  principally to fund the purchase of construction equipment to support our substantial backlog and property to be used in support of our building construction operations  and to fund million in financing activities  primarily to redeem the remaining outstanding shares of our preferred stock  and to pay down debt assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill 
as a result  we increased our cash balance by million during working capital increased  from million at the end of to million at december  the amount of working capital would have been substantially higher at december   however  due to the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets and our likely inability to liquidate our investments in auction rate securities in the near term  we classified million of these investments as long term at december  for a description of our accounting for auction rate securities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the current ratio decreased from x at december  to x at december  long term investments we hold a variety of highly rated primarily aaa or aa interest bearing auction rate securities that generally represent interests in pools of either interest bearing student loans or municipal bond issues 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days 
in the event that such auctions are unsuccessful  the holder of the securities is not able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
an unsuccessful auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not signify a default by the issuer 
upon an unsuccessful auction  the interest rates do not reset at a market rate but instead reset based upon a formula contained in the security  which rate is generally higher than the current market rate 
at december   we had million invested in auction rate securities 
during the first quarter of  we made substantial additional investments in auction rate securities 
since mid february  regularly scheduled auctions for these securities started to fail throughout the market at a significant rate 
at that time  we had million invested in auction rate securities 
since then  we have been successful in liquidating at par value a significant portion of our investment in auction rate securities 
at december   we had investments in auction rate securities of million which are reflected at fair value after recognition of a million pretax impairment charge in of this million impairment charge  million was deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
the million balance of the impairment charge was deemed to be temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to stockholders equity 
these investments are considered to be available for sale and are classified as long term investments 
our investment policy is to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines 
the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets have affected our ability to liquidate many of our investments in auction rate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash equivalent investments  our anticipated operating cash flows  and our available revolving facility and our supplemental facility discussed above  we do not expect that the short term lack of liquidity of our auction rate security investments will materially affect our overall liquidity position or our ability to execute our current business plan 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
long term debt long term debt  excluding current maturities of million  was million at december   an increase of million from december   due primarily to long term debt we assumed in conjunction with the merger with tutor saliba  as well as the financing of construction and transportation equipment purchases 
our outstanding debt is secured by the underlying assets 
approximately million of the million in debt outstanding at december  carries interest at a fixed rate 
due to an increase in stockholders equity as a result of the million shares of common stock issued in the merger with tutor saliba  the long term debt to equity ratio was 
x at december   compared to 
x at december  contractual obligations our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years total debt  excluding interest a interest payments on debt operating leases  net purchase obligations unfunded pension liability b b total contractual obligations a includes capital leases in the amount of b assumes annual pension fund contributions equal to the contribution amount anticipated in stockholders equity our book value per common share was at december   compared to at december   and at december  the major factors impacting stockholders equity during the three year period were the million shares issued in conjunction with the merger with tutor saliba  the net income loss recorded in all three years  the annual amortization of restricted stock compensation expense  common stock options and stock purchase warrants exercised  the income tax benefit attributable to stock based compensation  the redemption of the remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock in may  and preferred stock dividends accrued in prior to redemption 
also  we were required to adjust our accrued pension liability by an increase of million in  decreases of million and million in and  respectively  and a cumulative increase of million in prior years  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss  in accordance with sfas  which resulted in an aggregate million pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss reduction in stockholders equity at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
adjustments to the amount of this accrued pension liability will be recorded in future years based upon periodic re evaluation of the funded status of our pension plans 
dividends common stock there were no cash dividends declared or paid on our outstanding common stock during the three years ended december  related party transactions prior to our merger with tutor saliba  we were party to an agreement with tutor saliba and ronald n

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement and our short and long term investment portfolios 
our revolving credit agreement is available for us to borrow  when needed  for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at the applicable libor or base rate  as defined  and therefore we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
during and  we did not borrow under our revolving credit facility and the million balance outstanding on a million term loan was repaid in february  our outstanding debt at december  totaled million  of which approximately million carries interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  we do not believe our liquidity or our operations are subject to significant market risk for changes in interest rates 
we hold a variety of highly rated primarily aaa or aa interest bearing auction rate securities that generally represent interests in pools of either interest bearing student loans or municipal bond issues 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days

our investment policy is to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines 
the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets have affected our ability to liquidate many of our investments in auction rate securities
