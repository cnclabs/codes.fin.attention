item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made to the risk factors in item a for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward looking statements contained herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and overview we are the nation s eighth largest cable company based on the number of basic video subscribers  and among the leading cable operators focused on serving the smaller cities and towns in the united states 
through our interactive broadband network  we provide our customers with a wide array of advanced products and services  including video services such as vod  hdtv and dvrs  in addition to hsd and phone service 
we offer triple play bundles of video  hsd and voice to of our estimated homes passed 
bundled products and services offer our customers a single provider contact for ordering  provisioning  billing and customer care 
as of december   our cable systems passed an estimated million homes and served million basic subscribers in states 
we provide digital video services to  customers  representing a digital penetration of of our basic subscribers  hsd service to  customers  representing a hsd penetration of of our estimated homes passed  and phone service to  customers  representing a penetration of of our estimated marketable phone homes 
we evaluate our performance  in part  by measuring the number of rgus we serve 
as of december   we served million rgus  representing an increase of over the prior year 
revenues  costs and expenses video revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our core cable products and services including basic and digital cable programming services  wire maintenance  equipment rental and services to commercial establishments  pay per view charges  installation  reconnection and late payment fees and other ancillary revenues 
hsd revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to customers  including small to medium sized commercial establishments  for our hsd products and services and equipment rental fees  as well as fees charged to medium to large sized businesses for our scalable  fiber based enterprise network products and services 
phone revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to customers 
advertising revenues represent the sale of advertising time on various channels 
significant service costs include programming expenses  employee expenses related to wages and salaries of technical personnel who maintain our cable network  perform customer installation activities and provide customer support  hsd costs  including costs of bandwidth connectivity and customer provisioning  phone service costs  including delivery and other expenses  and field operating costs  including outside contractors  vehicle  utilities and pole rental expenses 
video programming costs  which are generally paid on a per subscriber basis  represent our largest single expense and have historically increased due to both increases in the rates charged for existing programming services and the introduction of new programming services to our customers 
these costs are expected to continue to grow principally because of contractual unit rate increases and the increasing demands of television broadcast station owners for retransmission consent fees 
as a consequence  it is expected that our video gross margins will decline as increases in programming costs outpace growth in video revenues 
significant selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and salaries for our call centers  customer service and support and administrative personnel  franchise fees and taxes  marketing  bad debt  billing  advertising  and office costs related to telecommunications and office administration 
corporate expenses reflect compensation of corporate employees and other corporate overhead 

table of contents adjusted oibda we define adjusted oibda as operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash  share based compensation charges 
adjusted oibda is one of the primary measures used by management to evaluate our performance and to forecast future results but is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs 
we believe adjusted oibda is useful for investors because it enables them to assess our performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management  and provides a measure that can be used to analyze  value and compare the companies in the cable industry  which may have different depreciation and amortization policies  as well as different non cash  share based compensation programs 
adjusted oibda and similar measures are used in calculating compliance with the covenants of our debt arrangements 
a limitation of adjusted oibda  however  is that it excludes depreciation and amortization  which represents the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business 
management utilizes a separate process to budget  measure and evaluate capital expenditures 
in addition  adjusted oibda has the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the non cash  share based compensation charges 
adjusted oibda should not be regarded as an alternative to either operating income or net income loss as an indicator of operating performance nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe that operating income is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted oibda

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview we have invested  and will continue to invest  in our network to enhance our reliability and capacity in customer growth  and in the further deployment of advanced product and services 
our capital spending today is devoted primarily to customer growth and the deployment of advanced services 
we have a high level of indebtedness and incur significant amounts of interest expense each year 
we believe that we will meet interest expense and principal payments  capital spending and other requirements through a combination of our net cash flows from operating activities  borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities  and our ability to secure future external financing 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient future financing  or  if we were able to do so  that the terms would be favorable to us 
as of december   our total debt was billion 
of this amount  million matures during the year ending december  during the year ended december   we paid cash interest of million  net of capitalized interest 
as of december   about of our outstanding indebtedness was at fixed interest rates or subject to interest rate protection 
recent developments in the credit markets in light of the unprecedented volatility in financial markets  we continue to assess the impact  if any  of recent market developments  including the bankruptcy  restructuring or merging of certain banks and investment banks on our financial position 
these assessments include a review of our continued access to liquidity in the credit markets and counterparty creditworthiness 
in this severely tightened credit environment  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our requirements over the next two years 
we fund our liquidity needs for capital investment  working capital  and other financial commitments through cash flow from continuing operations and available revolving credit commitments aggregating million as of december  we have million of debt maturities in and million of debt maturities in at this time  we are not aware of any of our revolver banks being in a position where they would be unable to fund borrowings made under our revolving credit commitments 
the turmoil in the financial markets may create additional risks in the foreseeable future  including the failure of additional banks  which could reduce amounts available to us under our revolving credit commitments 
if the current economic conditions were to persist or worsen  we may not be able to replace the liquidity lost as each revolving credit facility expires  or refinance outstanding balances on maturing revolving credit facilities  term loans or senior notes at all or on acceptable terms 
even if we can secure refinancing  if prevailing credit market conditions persist or worsen  we would likely pay considerably higher interest rates on any refinancing or new financing than those we currently pay 
bank credit facilities we own our cable systems through two principal subsidiaries  mediacom llc and mediacom broadband llc 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom llc llc group have a billion bank credit facility the llc credit facility expiring in  of which million was outstanding as of december  the llc credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million term loan and a million term loan 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom broadband llc broadband group have a billion bank credit facility the broadband credit facility expiring in  of which billion was outstanding as of december  the broadband credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million term loan  a million term loan and a million term loan 
continued access to our credit facilities is subject to our remaining in compliance with the covenants of these credit facilities  including covenants tied to our operating performance  principally the requirement that we maintain a maximum ratio of total senior debt to cash flow  as defined in our credit agreements  of to the average interest rates on outstanding debt under the bank credit facilities as of december  and were and  respectively  including the effect of the interest rate exchange agreements discussed below

as of the same date  million of unused revolving credit commitments were subject to scheduled reductions terminating on march   million and million of our unused credit commitments expire on september  and december   respectively  and are not subject to scheduled reductions prior to maturity 
giving pro forma effect to the completion of the exchange agreement on february   we had unused revolving credit commitments of approximately million as of december  the llc credit facility is collateralized by llc group s pledge of all its ownership interests in the operating subsidiaries owned by llc group and is guaranteed by llc group on a limited recourse basis to the extent of such ownership interests 
the broadband credit facility is collateralized by broadband group s pledge of all its ownership interests in the operating subsidiaries owned by broadband group and is guaranteed by broadband group on a limited recourse basis to the extent of such ownership interests 
as of december   approximately million of letters of credit were issued under our bank credit facilities to various parties as collateral for our performance relating to insurance and franchise requirements 
interest rate swaps we use interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  to fix the applicable eurodollar portion of debt under our broadband and llc credit facilities 
as of december   we had current interest rate swaps with various banks pursuant to which the interest rate on billion is fixed at a weighted average rate of approximately 
as of the same date  about of our outstanding indebtedness was at fixed interest rates or subject to interest rate protection 
these agreements have been accounted for on a mark to market basis as of  and for the year ended december  our current interest rate swaps are scheduled to expire in the amounts of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that fixed rates for two years at a weighted average of approximately on million of floating rate debt  commencing in and approximately on million of floating rate debt  commencing in we also entered forward starting interest rate swaps that fixed rates for three years at a weighted average rate of approximately on million of floating rate debt  commencing in these agreements have been accounted for on a mark to market basis as of  and for the year ended december  although we may be exposed to future losses in the event of counterparties non performance  we do not expect such losses  if any  to be material 
senior notes we have issued senior notes through mediacom llc and mediacom broadband llc totaling billion as of december  the indentures governing our senior notes also contain financial and other covenants  though they are generally less restrictive than those found in our bank credit facilities and do not require us to maintain any financial ratios 
principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow  as defined in these debt agreements  ranging from to at mediacom llc to to at mediacom broadband 
these agreements also contain limitations on dividends  investments and distributions 
covenant compliance and debt ratings for all periods through december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our bank credit facilities and senior note arrangements 
we believe that we will not have any difficulty complying with any of the applicable covenants in the foreseeable future 
our future access to the debt markets and the terms and conditions we receive are influenced by our debt ratings 
our corporate credit ratings are b  with a stable outlook  by moodys  and b  with a stable outlook  by standard and poors 
there are no covenants  events of default  borrowing conditions or other terms in our credit facilities or our other debt arrangements that are based on changes in our credit ratings assigned by any rating agency 
any future downgrade to our credit ratings could increase the interest rate on future debt issuance and adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and the effects they are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow  for the five years subsequent to december  and thereafter dollars in thousands operating interest purchase debt leases expense obligations total thereafter total cash obligations refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long term debt  and to note for a discussion of our operating leases and other commitments and contingencies 
interest payments on floating rate debt and interest rate swaps are estimated using amounts outstanding as of december  and the average interest rates applicable under such debt obligations 
we have contracts with programmers who provide video programming services to our subscribers 
our contracts typically provide that we have an obligation to purchase video programming for our subscribers as long as we deliver cable services to such subscribers 
we have no obligation to purchase these services if we are not providing cable services  except when we do not have the right to cancel the underlying contract or for contracts with a guaranteed minimum commitment 
we have included such amounts in our purchase obligations above  as follows million for  million for and million for critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
periodically  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  long lived assets  capitalized costs and accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of our accounting policies  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment we capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new service installation in accordance with sfas no 
 financial reporting by cable television companies 
costs associated with subsequent installations of additional services not previously installed at a customer s dwelling are capitalized to the extent such costs are incremental and directly attributable to the installation of such additional services 
capitalized costs include all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs 
capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment and depreciated over the average life of the related assets 
we use standard costing models  developed from actual historical costs and relevant operational data  to determine our capitalized amounts 
these models include labor rates  overhead rates and standard time inputs to perform various installation and construction activities 
the development of these standards involves significant judgment by management  especially in the development of standards for our newer  advanced products and services in which historical data is limited 
changes to the estimates or assumptions used in establishing these standards could be material 
we perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized 
any changes to these estimates  which may be significant  are applied in the period in which the evaluations were completed 

table of contents valuation and impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles as of december   we had approximately billion of unamortized intangible assets  including goodwill of million and franchise rights of billion on our consolidated balance sheets 
these intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
our cable systems operate under non exclusive cable franchises  or franchise rights  granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time 
we acquired these franchise rights through acquisitions of cable systems over the past several years 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new subscribers and to market new products and services  such as advanced digital television  hsd and phone  in a specific market territory 
we concluded that our franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since  among other things  there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the period over which these franchise rights contribute to our revenues and cash flows 
goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize franchise rights and goodwill 
instead  such assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
to test our goodwill and franchise rights for impairment 
we assess the fair values of each cable system cluster using discounted cash flow methodology  under which the fair value of cable franchise rights are determined in a direct manner 
this assessment involves significant judgment  including certain assumptions and estimates that determine future cash flow expectations and other future benefits  which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value 
these assumptions and estimates include discount rates  revenues per customer  market penetration as a percentage of homes passed and operating margin 
we also consider market transactions  market valuations and other valuations using multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization to confirm the reasonableness of fair values determined by the discounted cash flow methodology 
significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future  and such impairments could potentially be material 
based on the guidance outlined in eitf no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that the unit of accounting  or reporting unit  for testing goodwill and franchise rights for impairment resides at a cable system cluster level 
such level reflects the financial reporting level managed and reviewed by the corporate office ie  chief operating decision maker as well as how we allocated capital resources and utilize the assets 
lastly  the reporting unit level reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded 
we have two reporting units for the purpose of applying sfas no 
 mediacom broadband and mediacom llc 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with our carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds our carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds our fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  calculated using the residual method  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 
the impairment test for our franchise rights and other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 
since our adoption of sfas no 
in  we have not recorded any impairments as a result of our impairment testing 
we completed our most recent impairment test as of october   which reflected no impairment of our franchise rights  goodwill or other intangible assets 
our class a common stock price has had significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  along with a precipitous drop in equity securities prices across all sectors of the united states 
because there has not been a change in the fundamentals of our business  we do not believe that our stock price is the sole indicator of the 
table of contents underlying value of the assets in our reporting units 
we have therefore determined that this short term volatility in our stock price does not qualify as a triggering event under sfas no 
 and as such  no interim impairment test is required as of december  we could record impairments in the future if there are changes in the long term fundamentals of our business  in general market conditions or in the regulatory landscape that could prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our long lived intangible assets 
in the near term  the economic conditions currently affecting the us economy and how that may impact the fundamentals of our business  together with the recent volatility in our stock price  may have a negative impact on the fair values of the assets in our reporting units 
for illustrative purposes  if there were a hypothetical decline of  and in the fair values determined for cable franchise rights at our mediacom broadband reporting unit  an impairment loss of  million and million would result as of our impairment testing date of october   respectively 
in addition  a hypothetical decline of in the fair values determined for goodwill and other finite lived intangible assets at the same reporting unit  would not result in any impairment loss as of october  a hypothetical decline of in the fair values determined for goodwill  cable franchise rights and other finite lived intangible assets at our mediacom llc reporting unit  would not result in any impairment loss as of october  income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method as stipulated by sfas no 
this method generally provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and anticipated benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards  we assess all available positive and negative evidence including our most recent performance  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of taxable income in future periods and available prudent tax planning strategies 
in forecasting future taxable income we use assumptions that require significant judgment and are consistent with the estimates we use to manage our business 
during  we increased our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by million and recognized a corresponding non cash charge to the provision for income taxes 
at december   the valuation allowance had a balance of approximately million 
we will continue to monitor the need for the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
we expect to add to our valuation allowance any increase in deferred tax liabilities relating to indefinite lived intangible assets 
we will also adjust our valuation allowance if we assess that there is sufficient change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases  respectively  in our valuation allowance 
these changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the periods the estimates are revised 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates

inflation and changing prices our systems costs and expenses are subject to inflation and price fluctuations 
such changes in costs and expenses can generally be passed through to subscribers 
programming costs have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to do so 
we believe that under the fcc s existing cable rate regulations we 
table of contents may increase rates for cable services to more than cover any increases in programming 
however  competitive conditions and other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we use interest rate swaps with counterparties to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable interest rate debt 
as of december   we had billion of interest rate swaps with various banks with a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 
we also had several forward starting interest rate swaps with a fixed rate of approximately  billion and billion of which commence during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fixed rates of the interest rate swaps are offset against the applicable eurodollar rate to determine the related interest expense 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the other parties  however  we do not anticipate the nonperformance of any of our counterparties 
at december   based on the mark to market valuation  we would have paid approximately million  including accrued interest  if we terminated these interest rate swaps 
our current interest rate swaps are scheduled to expire in the amounts of million  million and million during the years ended december   and respectively
