item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net loss for fiscal was  million or per basic and diluted share  compared to net loss for fiscal of  million or per basic and diluted share  and net income of million or net loss of per basic and diluted share in fiscal our operating results are described in detail in the results of operations section of this item however  some of the key factors that impacted our results in fiscal   and are summarized as follows write off of goodwill during the quarter ended february   we impaired all of our existing goodwill  which resulted in a non cash charge of billion 
this entry was required due to the fact that the market value of rite aid corporation  as indicated by the trading price of our common stock  was less than the carrying value of our net assets as of february  the adjustment is discussed in further detail in the results of operations section of item income tax valuation allowance adjustments 
net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million 
the income tax expense was primarily due to a non cash write down of our remaining net federal and state deferred tax assets through an adjustment to our valuation allowance 
this change was primarily due to a decline in actual results from our previous forecast as a result of the impact of current economic conditions on results 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
according to sfas no 
 a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  sfas precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million related to a non cash increase of the valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred tax assets 
net income for fiscal included non cash income tax benefits of million related to the recognition of net deferred tax assets as a result of the release of a tax valuation allowance 

table of contents store closing and impairment charges we recorded store closing and impairment charges of million in fiscal  versus store closing and impairment charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal these charges were driven by an increase in store closure activity and higher store impairment charges 
the increase in closure activity was driven by our decision to close stores that  due to the acquisition of brooks eckerd  were in overlapping market areas 
the increase in store impairment was primarily due to a deteroriation in the operating performance of certain of our stores acquiried from jean coutu group and the assessment that future cash flows from these stores would not be sufficient to cover their asset value 
these items are discussed in further detail in the results of operations section of item lifo charges we record the value of our inventory on the last in  first out lifo method 
we recorded non cash lifo charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the significant increase in the lifo charge in fiscal was due to higher inflation on front end and pharmacy products 
acquisition of brooks eckerd 
on june   we acquired all of the membership interests of jean coutu usa  the holding company for brooks eckerd  from jean coutu group  pursuant to the terms of the agreement dated august  as consideration for the acquisition  we paid billion in cash and issued million shares of rite aid common stock 
we financed our cash payment via the establishment of a new term loan facility  issuance of senior notes and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility 
as part of the arrangement of the financing necessary to complete the acquisition  we incurred a million fee for bridge financing that ultimately was not needed 
this fee was recorded as a loss on debt modification in our statement of operations for fiscal as of february   jean coutu group owned million shares of rite aid common stock  which represents approximately of the total rite aid voting power 
we expanded our board of directors to members  with four of the seats being held by members designated by the jean coutu group 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a stockholder agreement the stockholder agreement with jean coutu group and certain family members 
the stockholder agreement contains provisions relating to jean coutu group s ownership interest in the company  board and board committee composition  corporate governance  stock ownership  stock purchase rights  transfer restrictions  voting arrangements and other matters 
we also entered into a registration rights agreement with jean coutu group giving jean coutu group certain rights with respect to the registration under the securities act of  as amended  of the shares of our common stock issued to jean coutu group or acquired by jean coutu group pursuant to certain stock purchase rights or open market rights under the stockholder agreement 
debt refinancing 
in fiscal years and  we took several steps to extend the terms of our debt and obtain more flexibility 
in fiscal  we issued our convertible notes due may  the proceeds of which were used to redeem our notes due december additionally  we consummated a tender offer and consent solicitation and repaid million of our notes due may  million of our notes due june and the full balance of our notes due january proceeds from the issuance of our notes due and our tranche term loan were used to fund the tender offer and consent solicitation 
we incurred a charge to call these notes prior to maturity and recorded a write off of unamortized debt issue costs 
these items totaled million  which was recorded as a loss on debt modification in fiscal in fiscal  we issued our senior secured notes due january  the proceeds of which were used to redeem our senior secured notes due february as a result of early redemption of an existing note  we recorded a loss on debt modification of million 

table of contents dilutive equity issuances 
at february   million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible preferred stock and convertible notes 
our million shares of potentially issuable common stock consist of the following shares in thousands strike price outstanding stock options a preferred stock convertible notes total and under to and over total issuable shares a the exercise of these options would provide cash of million 
recent events on december   our stockholders authorized a reverse stock split of our common stock at one of three ratios  for  for or for  to be selected by our board of directors 
the objective of the reverse stock split is to ensure that rite aid regains compliance with the nyse minimum share price listing rule 
on february   the nyse announced that it suspended application of the share price rule until june   which extends our cure period to regain compliance 
per the results of the suspension  we can now regain compliance by achieving the required close share price and average closing share price over the preceding consecutive trading days on any of the following dates april   may   june   and august  the board of directors will determine the exchange ratio and timing of the reverse stock split  if implemented  prior to or immediately following the end of the suspension period based on market conditions  the company s share price and the nyse rules at such time 
the board of directors will base the decision upon its evaluation of when such actions would be most advantageous to our company and our stockholders 
our common stock continues to be listed on the nyse and trade as usual

we include in same store sales all stores that have been open at least one year 
stores in liquidation are considered closed 
relocation stores are not included in same store sales until one year has lapsed 
pharmacy same store sales increased 
increases in price per prescription were partially offset by increased generic penetration and a same store prescription decline 
the decline in same store prescriptions was driven by script count declines in the brooks eckerd stores  switches of prescriptions to over the counter medications and the overall economic environment 
same store script growth at the core rite aid stores was for fiscal and same store script growth was a decline for the brooks eckerd stores 
however  the brooks eckerd pharmacy trends improved in each quarter in which brooks eckerd results were included in same store scripts 
in addition  customer satisfaction rates at the brooks eckerd stores have improved 
we expect this trend to continue as a result of our new rx savings card  our senior loyalty program  our courtesy refill program and other sales initiatives 
front end same store sales increased from the prior year  due to strong performance in our consumable and over the counter categories and improvement in our private brand penetration 
these items were somewhat offset by weakness in the overall economic environment  which had a negative impact on seasonal sales in the second half of the fiscal year and decreases in photo sales  which were due to the continuing trend of consumers printing fewer images as well as the disruption of services due to the conversion of our photo technology to fuji digital equipment

in addition to favorable demographic trends  our script growth was positively impacted by medicare part d and by initiatives such as our focus on customer satisfaction  prescription file buys  our senior citizen loyalty program and the new and relocated store program 
partially offsetting these items was an increase in generic sales and lower reimbursement including lower reimbursement rates from the new medicare part d program 
the rate of same store pharmacy sales growth has declined from the previous year primarily due to a lower rate of new enrollment in the medicare part d program  a greater mix of generic prescriptions and a weaker cough  cold and flu season 
front end same store sales increased  due to strong performance in core categories  such as over the counter and consumables and a higher percentage of promotional sales were offset somewhat by the impact of a difficult economic environment during the holiday season and a weaker cough  cold and flu season

pharmacy gross margin rate on a fifo basis improved due to an increase in the percentage of generic drugs and a lower cost of generics  partially offset by lower reimbursement rates 
front end gross margin on a fifo basis was flat  as improvements in shrink were offset by a reduction in photo sales 
gross margin rate was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the improvement in gross margin rate for fiscal was driven by an improvement in pharmacy gross margin rates  front end gross margin rates  and a lower lifo charge

the improvement in the front end gross margin rate was primarily due to an increase in vendor promotional support 
the reduction in lifo charges was primarily due to lower pharmacy product inflation 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in distribution expense as a percentage of sales  due to higher fuel costs and increases in other expenses not offset by productivity improvements

the lifo charge was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenue  compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to increased intangible assets resulting from the allocation of the purchase price of brooks eckerd  an increase in rent and occupancy expenses due to new and relocated stores and the sale leaseback of owned stores 
these items were somewhat offset by a decrease in integration expense and advertising costs 
although sg a on a year to date basis increased as a percent of revenues  sg a decreased as a percent of revenues in the third and fourth quarter 
sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenue  compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the integration of the brooks eckerd stores and distribution centers  an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to increased intangible assets resulting from the preliminary allocation of the purchase price of brooks eckerd and an increase in rent and occupancy expense from new and relocated stores and the sale and leaseback of owned stores 
these increases were partially offset by expense control in other expense categories 
goodwill impairment we have a policy to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of our fiscal year  or more frequently if events or circumstances would occur that would indicate a reduction in our fair value 
on february   the carrying value of our net assets  before goodwill impairment testing  was million and the market capitalization of our outstanding shares  assuming conversion of outstanding preferred shares  was million 
accordingly  we performed a goodwill impairment test and concluded that because of the length of time in which the carrying value of our net assets exceeded the market value of our outstanding shares  an impairment of goodwill was required under the accounting rules set forth in sfas no 
after determining that an impairment of goodwill was necessary  we performed a step two test which values the total company net assets at fair value as if a purchase business combination had occurred 
the fair value of our net assets utilizing this test indicated that the entire balance of our goodwill should be impaired as of february  and therefore we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion in fiscal 
table of contents lease termination and impairment charges lease termination and impairment charges consist of year ended february  weeks march  weeks march  weeks dollars in thousands impairment charges store and equipment lease exit charges impairment charges 
in fiscal   and  store closing and impairment charges include non cash charges of million  million and million  respectively  for the total or partial impairment of long lived assets at   and stores  respectively 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were identified for impairment as part of our on going store performance review at all of our stores or management s intention to relocate or close a specific store 
the increase in impairment charges in fiscal was primarily due to current and projected operating results at certain of our brooks eckerd stores not being sufficient to cover the asset values of these stores 
store and equipment lease exit charges 
in fiscal   and  we recorded charges for   and stores  respectively  to be closed or relocated under long term leases 
charges to close a store  which principally consist of lease termination costs  are recorded at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated  pursuant to the guidance set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the discounted effect of future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or favorable lease terminations 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
the increase in the store and equipment lease exit charge for the fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores closed and a decrease in the amount of assumed sublease income over the remaining minimum lease term 
as part of our ongoing business activities  we assess stores for potential closure 
decisions to close stores in future periods would result in charges for store lease exit costs and liquidation of inventory  as well as impairment of assets at these stores 
interest expense in fiscal   and  interest expense was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in compared to was primarily due to increased borrowings to fund the brooks eckerd acquisition and related integration activities partially offset by lower interest rates  which were caused by a decrease in libor  which decreased the interest rate on borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  and were  and  respectively

the fiscal income tax 
table of contents expense included non cash income tax expense of million related to the write down of our remaining net federal and state deferred tax assets through an adjustment to our valuation allowance 
sfas no 
requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all available positive and negative evidence with regard to the recognition of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect recognition of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
according to sfas no 
 a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  sfas no 
precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income generated in the carryforward periods 
the fiscal income tax expense included a non cash tax expense of million related to an increase of the valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred tax assets 
the existence of negative evidence at march   was primarily the result of recently completed acquisition of brooks eckerd and the impact on current year earnings due to planned integration and acquisition activities  compounded by the weakening economy during the later half of the year 
the fiscal income tax benefit included a non cash state tax benefit of million which primarily related to an increase in our state tax rate applied to the net deferred tax assets partially offset by a non cash state tax expense of million related to an increase in the valuation allowance we monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets 
we maintained a valuation allowance of  million and  million against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general we have four primary sources of liquidity i cash and cash equivalents  ii cash provided by operating activities  iii the sale of accounts receivable under our first lien receivable securitization facility  and iv the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  to fund capital expenditures and to provide funds for payment of our debt 
as described in greater detail in the results of operations section  we incurred significant non cash charges in fiscal  including a charge of billion for the impairment of goodwill  income tax expense of million  which was predominately due to a non cash write down of our remaining federal and state deferred tax assets  and store closing and impairment charges of million 
in addition  we incurred lifo charges of million 
these charges have no impact on our liquidity  credit facilities or compliance with existing debt covenants 
credit facility our senior secured credit facility includes a billion revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility currently bear interest at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
the interest rate can fluctuate between libor plus and libor plus depending on the amount of the revolver availability  as specified in the senior secured credit facility 
we are required to pay fees of per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the final maturity date on our revolving credit facility is september  
table of contents our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of inventory and prescription files 
at february   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at february   we also had letters of credit outstanding against the revolving credit facility of million  which resulted in additional borrowing capacity of million 
based upon our borrowing base calculation and planned reductions in inventory  we may not be able to borrow the maximum amount under our revolving credit facility at some points during fiscal however  we do not expect this restriction to have a significant impact on liquidity 
in november  we entered into an amendment of our senior secured credit facility and borrowed million under a senior secured term loan the tranche term loans 
the tranche term loans currently bear interest at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus the interest rate can fluctuate between libor plus and libor plus depending on the amount of availability under our revolving credit facility  as specified in the senior secured credit facility 
the amounts outstanding under the tranche term loans become due and payable on september   or earlier  if total debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility exceeds the borrowing base 
on june   we amended our senior secured credit facility  to establish a new senior secured term loan in the aggregate principal amount of  million and borrowed the full amount thereunder 
a portion of the proceeds from the borrowings under this senior secured term loan the tranche term loans were used to fund the acquisition of brooks eckerd 
the tranche term loans will mature on june  and currently bear interest at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
we must make mandatory prepayments of the tranche term loans with the proceeds of asset dispositions subject to certain limitations  with a portion of any excess cash flow generated by us and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt and casualty events subject to certain exceptions 
if at any time total debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility exceeds the borrowing base  prepayment of the tranche term loans may also be required 
in july  we issued a new senior secured term loan tranche term loans of million under our existing senior secured credit facility

we must make mandatory prepayments of the tranche term loans with the proceeds of asset dispositions subject to certain limitations  with a portion of any excess cash flow generated by us and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt and casualty events subject to certain exceptions 
if at any time total debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility exceeds the borrowing base  prepayment of the tranche term loans may also be required 
the senior secured credit facility allows us to have outstanding  at any time  up to billion in secured second priority debt and unsecured debt in addition to borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and existing indebtedness  provided that not in excess of million of such secured second priority debt and unsecured debt shall mature or require scheduled payment of principal prior to three months after june  the senior secured credit facility allows us to incur an unlimited amount of unguaranteed unsecured debt with a maturity beyond three months after june   however  other debentures may limit the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence of said debt 
the senior secured credit facility also allows for the voluntary repurchase of any publicly traded debt with a maturity on or before june   and for the voluntary repurchase of publicly traded debt with a maturity after june   if we maintain availability on the revolving credit facility of at least million and so long as the senior secured credit facility is not in default 

table of contents the senior secured credit facility contains covenants  which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above  the payments of dividends  sale of assets  mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens 
the senior secured credit facility also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  but only if availability on the revolving credit facility is less than million 
the senior secured credit facility provides for events of default including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if the company fails to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of million or any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity or require the repurchase of such debt 
other transactions on june   we commenced a tender offer and consent solicitation under which we offered to repurchase all outstanding amounts of our senior secured notes due may  our senior secured notes due january and our senior notes due june on july   the tender offer expired and on july  we repaid million of the outstanding balance of our notes due may  million of our notes due january and million of the outstanding balance of our notes due june in addition  on july   we sent a notice of redemption for the remaining outstanding notes due and satisfied and discharged the indenture governing such notes 
as a result of this tender and consent solicitation  the indentures governing these notes were amended to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants therein including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt and grant liens against assets 
in addition  the guarantees on each series were eliminated and the notes are no longer secured 
we did the transaction because these notes had restrictions on secured debt that prohibited us from fully drawing on our revolving credit facility under certain circumstances 
we incurred a loss on debt modification related to this transaction of million 
these transactions were financed via the issuance of a new senior secured term loan the tranche term loan described above and the issuance of a million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due july these notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations of rite aid corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness

the indentures that govern our secured and guaranteed unsecured notes contain restrictions on the amount of additional secured debt that we can incur 
as of february   the amount of additional secured debt that could be incurred under these indentures was approximately million which amount does not include the ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions 
at our option we could also incur this debt in whole or in part on an unsecured basis 
the amount of additional second priority secured or unsecured debt that we could have incurred if we had drawn the maximum amount available million on our revolving credit facility as of february  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit was million

the following table details receivable transfer activity for the years presented in thousands year ended february  weeks march  weeks march  weeks average amount of outstanding receivables transferred total receivable transfers collections made by the company as part of the servicing arrangement on behalf of the cpvs we are charged a program fee and a liquidity fee under the first lien facility 
the program fee is libor plus of the total amount advanced under the facility 
the liquidity fee is of the total facility commitment of million 
the program and liquidity fees are recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
program and liquidity fees for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
rite aid guarantees certain performance obligations of our affiliates under the first lien facility  which include continued servicing of such receivables  but does not guarantee the collectibility of the receivables and obligor creditworthiness 
the cpvs have a commitment to purchase that ends january with the option to extend to september  should any of the cpvs fail to renew their commitment under the first lien facility  we have access to a backstop credit facility  which is backed by the cpvs and which expires september  proceeds from the collections under the first lien facility are submitted to an independent trustee on a daily basis 
the trustee withholds any cash necessary to fund amounts owed to the cpvs as a result of such collections and  fund the cpvs when the securitization formula indicates a lesser amount of outstanding receivables transferred is warranted 
the remaining collections are swept to our corporate concentration account 
at february  and march   we had million and million of cash  respectively  that was restricted for the payment of trustee fees 
on february   we entered into a million second priority accounts receivable securitization term loan second lien facility 
net proceeds from the issuance of the second lien facility were used to repay approximately million outstanding under our securitization agreements and replace the borrowing availability that was decreased under the first lien facility 
the second lien facility has a second priority interest in eligible third party receivables 
this interest is subordinated to the interest of the securitization banks under the first lien facility 
the second lien facility was sold at a discount of and bears interest at a rate of either  at our option  a a base rate equal to the higher of i citibank s base rate  ii the federal funds rate plus per annum or iii an adjusted libor rate plus per annum  in each case plus or b libor plus with a libor floor of 
the second lien facility will mature on september  we incurred one time issuance fees of approximately million related to the second lien facility  which are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  financing fees related to the second lien facility were million 
we have determined that the transactions under the first lien facility and second lien facility meet the criteria for sales treatment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
additionally  we have determined that we do not hold a variable interest in the cpvs or in the lenders in the second lien facility  pursuant to the guidance in fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  and therefore have determined that de recognition of the transferred receivables is appropriate

table of contents obligations for income tax uncertainties pursuant to fin of approximately million are not included in the table above as we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by net proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization  reductions in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
the decrease in inventory is primarily due to the efforts made by management to reduce excess inventory and a decrease in purchasing volume  which also impacted accounts payable 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by net proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization and a reduction in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in inventory and a decrease in accounts payable 
the increase in inventory was primarily caused by brooks eckerd integration activities 
integration activities that require a temporary investment in inventory include replacing discontinued inventory  increasing the number of sku s at the brooks eckerd distribution centers and retrofitting the planograms in the brooks eckerd stores 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to conforming vendor terms as part of the integration efforts 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted by income from operations  net proceeds of million for the sale of certain of our third party receivables and a decrease in accounts payable 
these items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was offset in part by proceeds from our sale leaseback transactions and proceeds from other asset dispositions 
cash used in investing activities was  million in fiscal cash used was primarily for the acquisition of brooks eckerd and purchase of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets offset by proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and asset dispositions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  the purchase of prescription file and capitalizable direct acquisition costs related to our pending acquisition of brooks eckerd 
cash was provided by proceeds from our sale leaseback transactions and proceeds from other asset dispositions 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal due to the net impact of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and redemption of various notes  amending of our credit facility and principal payments on long term debt 
cash provided by financing activities was  million in fiscal cash provided by financing was primarily provided by proceeds from issuance of long term debt utilized to fund the brooks eckerd acquisition  net proceeds from our revolving credit facility  the change in the zero balance cash accounts and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  offset by financing costs paid  scheduled debt payments and preferred stock dividends 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal cash provided from issuance of two bonds and the term loan portion of our senior secured credit facility was used to fund the redemption and payment at maturity of several bonds and to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  consisting of approximately related to the new store construction and store relocation  related 
table of contents to store remodels and related to backstage  infrastructure and maintenance requirements 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operating activities and use of the revolving credit facility 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  including current conditions in the financial markets  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
we expect our efforts to maintain our nyse listing will be successful 
however  if our common stock is not listed on the nyse or another national exchange  holders of our convertible notes due the convertible notes will be entitled to require us to repurchase their convertible notes 
our senior secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facilities provide that the occurrence of this repurchase right constitutes a default under such facilities 
to avoid such a scenario  we may seek to refinance the convertible notes 
we can give no assurance that we would be able to obtain any required financing  including a refinancing  on favorable terms  if at all  or that we would receive any waiver or consents required under our debt instruments 
based upon our current levels of operations  planned improvements in our operating performance  the approval by our stockholders of the proposed reverse stock split  the suspension of the minimum price listing requirement by the nyse and the opportunities that we believe the acquisition of brooks eckerd provides  we believe that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  sales of accounts receivable under our first lien securitization facility  and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
our billion revolving credit facility and our million tranche term loan mature on september  we intend to refinance these facilities prior to their maturity dates and expect these efforts to be successful 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance these facilities on terms acceptable to us 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance  conditions in the financial markets  status of the listing of our stock on the nyse  valuations of the collateral securing our senior credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facilities and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard establishes a standard definition for fair value  establishes a framework under generally accepted accounting principles for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in december  a fasb staff position fsp was proposed to delay the effective dates of sfas no 
as it relates to all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  or at least annually 
we have adopted sfas no 
as of march  as it relates to financial assets and liabilities and there was no impact on the financial statements 
we will adopt sfas no 
as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities in the quarter ending may  and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised business combinations 
sfas revised establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and makes several changes to the method of accounting for business combinations previously set forth in sfas no 
sfas no 
revised will become effective for acquisitions consummated in fiscal years beginning after december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrink  impairment  self insurance liabilities  pension benefits  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
variability reflected in the sensitivity analyses presented below is based on our recent historical experience 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and sensitivity analyses 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management allowance for uncollectible receivables almost all of our prescription sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  prescription benefit management companies  government agencies  private employers  health maintenance organizations or other managed care providers 
we recognize and report receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers  who are employees or members of those payors  which have not yet been paid 
we maintain an allowance for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this allowance is calculated based upon historical collection and write off activity adjusted for current conditions 
the estimated bad debt write off rate is calculated by dividing historical write offs for the most recent twelve months  for which collection activities have been completed  by third party payor sales for the same period 
a bad debt expense is recognized by applying the estimated write off rate to third party payor sales for the period 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our estimated write off rate over the past three years 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  an additional reserve would be recorded in the period in which the change in financial condition first became known 
based on current conditions  we do not expect a significant change to our write off rate in future periods 
a one basis point difference in our estimated write off rate for the year ended february   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
inventory the carrying value of our inventory is reduced by a reserve for estimated shrink losses that occur between physical inventory dates 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations including stores and distribution centers  as well as overall loss trends as determined during physical inventory procedures 
the estimated shrink rate is calculated by dividing historical shrink results for stores inventoried in the most recent six months by the sales for the same period 
shrink expense is recognized by applying the estimated shrink rate to sales since the last physical inventory 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our shrink rate over the last three years 
although possible  we do not expect a significant change to our shrink rate in future periods 
a basis point difference in our estimated shrink rate for the year ended february   would have affected pre tax income by approximately million 

table of contents goodwill impairment our policy is to perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually  and more frequently if events or circumstances occurred that would indicate a reduced fair value in our reporting unit could exist 
our impairment calculation was based on a comparison of the book value of our equity to our estimated fair value 
we estimated fair value utilizing both a discounted cash flow analysis that was based on forward year projections and the value implied by our quoted stock price 
based on the decline in our stock price during fiscal  we performed an assessment of goodwill impairment at the end of our fiscal third quarter and year end and concluded at year end that our goodwill was impaired 
in accordance with our policy  if events indicate that an impairment has occurred  we perform a step two test under which we value the net assets of our company other than goodwill as if a purchase business combination had occurred  and compare that value to our company s market capitalization 
the difference between the theoretical net asset value of our company utilizing this calculation and the our market capitalization is the amount of goodwill impairment that we record 
based upon the results of this test  we impaired the entire balance of our goodwill at the end of fiscal impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
we have identified each store as an asset group for purposes of performing this evaluation 
our evaluation of whether possible impairment indicators exist includes comparing future cash flows expected to be generated by the store to the carrying value of the store s assets 
if the estimated future cash flows of the asset group store level are less than the carrying amount of the store s assets  we calculate an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the store s assets to the fair value of such assets 
we determine fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the store discussed above 
cash flows are calculated utilizing the detailed store financial plan for the year immediately following the current year end 
to arrive at cash flow estimates for additional future years  we project sales growth by store consistent with our overall business planning objectives and results  and determine the incremental cash flow that such sales growth will contribute to that store s operations 
the discount rate used is our credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the assumptions utilized in calculating impairment are updated annually 
should actual sales growth rates and related incremental cash flow differ from those forecasted and projected  we may incur future impairment charges related to the stores being evaluated 
changes in our discount rate of basis points would not have a material impact on the total impairment recorded in fiscal self insurance liabilities we expense claims for self insured medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage as incurred including an estimate for claims incurred but not paid 
the expense for self insured medical and dental claims incurred but not paid is determined by multiplying the average claim value paid over the most recent twelve months by the average number of days from the same period between when the claims were incurred and paid 
there have been no significant changes in assumptions used to determine days lag over the last three years 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was previously estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  expense recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
a one day change in days lag for the year ended february   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
the expense for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims incurred but not paid is determined using several factors  including historical claims experience and development  severity of claims  medical costs and the time needed to settle claims 
we discount the estimated expense for workers compensation to present value as the time period from incurrence of the claim to final settlement can be several years 
we base our estimates for such timing on previous settlement activity 
the discount rate is based on the current market rates for treasury bills that approximate the average time to settle the workers compensation claims 
these assumptions are updated on an annual 
table of contents basis 
a basis point difference in the discount rate for the year ended february   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
benefit plan accrual we have several defined benefit plans  under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the plan 
we record expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that utilize various assumptions 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the mortality rate  the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these rates are updated annually and are based on available public information  market interest rates and internal plans regarding compensation and any other changes impacting benefits 
these assumptions have not significantly changed over the last three years  except that the discount rate has been adjusted due to changes in rates derived from published high quality long term bond indices  the terms of which approximate the term of the cash flows to pay the accumulated benefit obligations when due 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate  assuming no other changes in the estimates  increases the amount of the projected benefit obligation and the related required expense by million and million  respectively 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs and anticipated future subleases of properties 
the reserves are calculated at the individual location level and the assumptions are assessed at that level 
sublease income is estimated based on agreements in place at the time of reserve assessment 
the reserve for lease exit liabilities is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
reserve estimates and related assumptions are updated on a quarterly basis 
a substantial amount of our closed stores were closed prior to our adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective january  therefore  if interest rates change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
in addition  changes in the real estate leasing markets can have an impact on the reserve 
as of february   a basis point variance in the credit adjusted risk free interest rate would have affected pretax income by approximately million for fiscal income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate significant deferred tax assets which are currently offset by a valuation allowance 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence including our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
the weight given to the potential effect of the negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we will establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our valuation allowance over the last three years 
however  changes in market conditions and the impact of the acquisition of brooks eckerd on operations have caused changes in the valuation allowance from period to period which were included in the tax provision in the period of change 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fin and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
these estimates are updated as the facts and circumstances of the cases 
table of contents develop and or change 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
changes to these reserves during the last three fiscal years were not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
we currently do not have any derivative transactions outstanding 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of february  thereafter total fair value at february  dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are based on libor 
changes in one month libor affect our cost of borrowings because the interest rate on our variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by basis points as of february  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our variable rate debt outstanding of approximately  million on february  a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures 
in addition to the financial instruments listed above  the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our receivables securitization agreements are determined based on libor
