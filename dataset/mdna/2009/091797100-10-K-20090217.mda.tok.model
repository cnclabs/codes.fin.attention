of that decline  approximately basis points was attributable to a reduction in gross margin  approximately basis points was attributable to an increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses  and approximately basis points was attributable to a million pre tax restructuring charge 
the decrease in gross margin was driven by the negative effects of commodity inflation together with the change in china s value added tax and appreciation of the chinese renminbi which  in the aggregate  increased cost of goods sold over the level by approximately million

the corporation also estimated the effects on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar 
a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar would have the effect of increasing gross profits 
in addition to their direct effects  changes in exchange rates also affect sales volumes and foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates previously described does not reflect a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices nor does it reflect higher exchange rates  as compared to those experienced during  inherent in the foreign exchange hedging portfolio at december  critical accounting policies the corporation s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the corporation believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation  or complexity than other accounting policies 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation performs goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the corporation cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled  million at december  such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the corporation s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rates of salary increase  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates  and other factors 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis prior to the beginning of each year 
the corporation considers current market conditions  including interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the corporation develops the discount rates by considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the related benefit obligation 
the corporation s discount rate for united states defined benefit pension plans was and at december  and  respectively 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation develops the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors  which include its targeted asset allocation percentages  historic returns  and expected future returns 
the corporation s expected long term rate of return assumption for united states defined benefit plans for and was and  respectively 
the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and a calculated value of assets referred to as the market related value of assets 
the corporation s aggregate market related value of assets exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million as of december  differences between assumed and actual returns are amortized to the market related value on a straight line basis over a five year period 
also  gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and from differences between assumptions and actual experience except those differences being amortized to the market related value of assets are amortized over the expected remaining service period of active plan participants or  for retired participants  the average remaining life expectancy  to the extent that such amounts exceed ten percent of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year 
the corporation expects that its pension and other postretirement benefit costs in will approximate the level 
as more fully described in item of this report  the corporation is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including those with respect to environmental matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the corporation evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss  and in certain instances  the ability of other parties to share costs 
also  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  when a range of probable loss exists  the corporation accrues at the low end of the range when no other more likely amount exists 
unanticipated events or changes in these factors may require the corporation to increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued because it was not probable 
further  as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  insurance recoveries for environmental and certain general liability claims have not been recognized until realized 
any insurance recoveries  if realized in future periods  could have a favorable impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations in the periods realized 
note of notes to consolidation financial statements further discusses significant environmental matters which may affect the corporation

these factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements

financial condition introduction the following summarizes the corporation s cash flows for each of the three years ended december  in millions of dollars 
cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow used in investing activities cash flow used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year the corporation s operating cash flows provide the primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures 
operating cash flow is first used to fund capital expenditures and dividends to the corporation s stockholders 
other significant uses of operating cash flow may include share repurchases  acquisitions of businesses  and debt reduction 
as necessary  the corporation supplements its operating cash flow with debt 
the corporation s operating cash flow is significantly impacted by its net earnings and working capital management 
the corporation anticipates that its operating cash flow in will be adversely impacted by lower net earnings than those experienced in cash inflows and outflows related to the corporation s currency hedging activities are classified in the cash flow statement under operating activities or investing activities based upon the nature of the hedge 
cash flows related to hedges of the corporation s foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and forecasted transactions are classified as operating activities  and cash flows related to hedges of the corporation s net investment in foreign subsidiaries are classified as investing activities 
due to the rapid strengthening of the us dollar in late  the corporation experienced much larger gains and losses on these hedges than it has in the past 
therefore  based upon current exchange rates  the corporation expects that cash outflows associated with currency hedges whose cash flows are classified within operating activities will significantly reduce cash flows from operating activities in however  such reduction is expected to be largely offset by cash inflows associated with hedges of the corporation s net investment in foreign subsidiaries that are classified within cash flows from investing activities 
the corporation will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs  capital expenditures  and dividends to stockholders  to pay interest  and to service debt 
at december   the corporation had million of cash and cash equivalents 
most of the corporation s cash is held by its subsidiaries 
the corporation s overall cash position reflects its business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management  economic factors  the statutes  regulations and practices in jurisdictions where the corporation has operations  and tax considerations 
at december   the corporation had million of borrowing available under a billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in december if necessary  that facility serves as a backstop to the corporation s uncommitted commercial paper borrowings 
in order to meet its cash requirements  the corporation intends to use its existing cash  cash equivalents  and internally generated funds  and to borrow under its commercial paper program  existing unsecured revolving credit facility or under short term borrowing facilities  and to consider additional term financing 
if its current credit ratings were to be reduced  the corporation may no longer be able to obtain short term financing under its commercial paper program 
the recent turmoil in the credit markets has resulted in higher borrowing costs and  for some companies  has limited access to credit  however  the corporation believes that it can continue to access credit although any new borrowings may be at less favorable terms than the corporation has historically experienced 
the corporation believes that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet its cash requirements over the next months 
cash flow from operating activities operating activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to lower net earnings  higher usage of cash associated with other assets and liabilities  including the impact of the corporation s foreign currency hedging activities  lower cash generated from working capital  and increased cash spending associated with restructuring activities 
the lower level of cash generated from working capital in  as compared to  was primarily due to the increase in cash used associated with accounts payable associated with both production levels and timing of payments and other current liabilities due  in part  to a tax payment in the period associated with the settlement of us tax litigation and the higher level of payments made during  as compared to  associated with prior year end accruals  including accruals for customer incentives  employee incentives  and advertising and promotion 
those items were partially offset by increased cash provided by accounts receivable associated with the lower level of sales during and inventories associated with the lower level of inventories during 
as part of its capital management  the corporation reviews certain working capital metrics 
for example  the corporation evaluates its trade receivables and inventory levels through the computation of days sales outstanding and inventory turnover ratio  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding as of december   increased moderately from the level as of december  average inventory turns as of december   were consistent with inventory turns as of december  the corporation sponsors pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the corporation s cash funding of these plans was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
cash contribution requirements for these plans are either based upon the applicable regulation for each country principally the us and united kingdom or are funded on a pay as you go basis 
the corporation expects that its cash funding of its pension and postretirement benefit plans will approximate million to million in that increase in cash funding is principally attributable to the corporation s qualified pension plans in the us cash contributions for the corporation s qualified pension plans in the us are governed by the pension protection act of ppa 
contribution requirements under the ppa are generally based upon the funded status of the plan determined by comparing plan assets to the actuarially determined plan obligations 
the reduction in the fair value of the corporation s pension plan assets that occurred in will require the corporation to make contributions to its us qualified pension plans in these contribution requirements could also continue or increase in years subsequent to unless there is an improvement in the funded status of the corporation s us qualified pension plans 
cash flow from investing activities investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  cash used by investing activities in included the purchase of spiralock for million  net of cash acquired 
hedging activities associated with the corporation s net investment hedging activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million in  as compared to a net cash outflow of million in  due to the effects of the strengthening us dollar during  as compared to a weakening us dollar during capital expenditures decreased by million from the level to million in the corporation anticipates that its capital spending in will approximate million 
the ongoing costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had  and are not expected to have  a material adverse effect on the corporation s capital expenditures or financial position 
cash flow from financing activities financing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  cash used by financing activities in included the purchase by the corporation of  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million  a net increase in short term borrowings of million  and dividend payments of million 
dividend payments  on a per share basis  in were consistent with  however  the amount paid declined million due to the lower level of common stock outstanding 
future dividends will depend on the corporation s earnings  financial condition  and other factors 
sources of cash from financing activities in included proceeds from long term debt of million and proceeds received upon the issuance of common stock  including certain related income tax benefits  under stock based compensation plans of million 
cash used by financing activities in included the purchase by the corporation of  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million  the repayment of the notes due july  of million  and dividend payments of million 
in  the corporation increased its dividend payment  on a per share basis  from in to in however  the effect of the increase in the corporation s dividend payment was offset by the lower level of common stock outstanding 
sources of cash from financing activities in included proceeds from short term borrowings of million and proceeds received upon the issuance of common stock  including certain related income tax benefits  under stock based compensation plans of million 
the corporation carried out its share repurchase program based upon the belief that its shares were undervalued and to manage share growth resulting from option exercises 
at december   the corporation has remaining authorization from its board of directors to repurchase an additional  shares of its common stock 
credit rating the corporation s credit ratings are reviewed periodically by major debt rating agencies including moody s investors service  standard poor s  and fitch ratings 
the corporation s credit ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of december   follow long term debt short term debt outlook moody s investors service baa p stable standard poor s bbb a stable fitch ratings bbb f stable on january   standard poor s s p placed its ratings on the corporation on creditwatch with negative implications 
on february   moody s investors service placed its ratings on the corporation under review for possible downgrade  noting that the review would likely result in no more than a one notch rating change  leaving the corporation s senior unsecured ratings within the investment grade rating category 
on february   fitch ratings affirmed the corporation s bbb f ratings  but revised its outlook from stable to negative 
accordingly  it is possible that  during  s p  moody s investors service  and fitch ratings could reduce the corporation s credit ratings from the levels indicated above 
the credit rating agencies consider many factors when assigning their ratings 
the impact of the global economic environment and distress in the financial markets are expected to adversely impact the corporation s financial performance in the distress in the financial market has also significantly increased the unfunded status of the corporation s pension plans  which is a factor considered by the credit rating agencies in their evaluations 
these factors will negatively impact certain financial metrics utilized by the credit rating agencies in determining the corporation s credit rating 
accordingly  it is possible that the credit rating agencies could reduce the corporation s credit ratings from their current levels 
the corporation s ability to maintain its commercial paper program and its ability to obtain long term debt financing at comparable risk based interest rates is principally a function of its current credit standing 
if its current credit rating were to be reduced  the corporation may no longer be able to obtain short term financing under its commercial paper program 
also  any borrowings under the corporation s billion unsecured credit facility are at interest rates that vary based upon the rating of its long term debt 
the corporation s current borrowing rates under its credit facility are at libor plus 
the spread above libor could increase by a maximum amount of 
based upon reductions in the corporation s credit rating 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of the corporation s contractual obligations by due date in millions of dollars 
the corporation s short term borrowings  long term debt  and lease commitments are more fully described in notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period less than year to years to years after years total short term borrowings a b c long term debt c operating leases purchase obligations d total contractual cash obligations e f a as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation has a billion commercial paper program as well as a supporting billion credit facility that matures in december at december   there was million outstanding under the commercial paper program and million outstanding under other short term borrowing arrangements 
the corporation s average borrowing outstanding under these facilities during was million 
b as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation has uncommitted lines of credit of approximately million at december  these uncommitted lines of credit do not have termination dates and are reviewed periodically 
c payments due by period include contractually required interest payments 
contractually required interest payments on variable rate long term debt presented is based upon variable borrowing rates at december  d the corporation enters into contractual arrangements that result in its obligation to make future payments  including purchase obligations 
the corporation enters into these arrangements in the ordinary course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of inventories  machinery and equipment  or services 
purchase obligations primarily consist of inventory purchase commitments  including raw materials  components  and sourced products  sponsorship arrangements  and arrangements for other services 
e the corporation anticipates that funding of its pension and postretirement benefit plans in will approximate million to million 
that amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or  with respect to unfunded plans  necessary to fund current benefits 
the corporation has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
f as more fully disclosed in notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the corporation adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  at december   the corporation has recognized million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of which million related to interest 
the final outcome of these tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations  legal proceedings  competent authority proceedings  changes in regulatory tax laws  or interpretation of those tax laws  or expiration of statutes of limitation 
however  based on the number of jurisdictions  the uncertainties associated with litigation  and the status of examinations  including the protocols of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities  which could include formal legal proceedings  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these tax uncertainties 
as of december   the corporation classified million of its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability 
while the corporation cannot reasonably predict the timing of the cash flows  if any  associated with its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  it believes that such cash flows would principally occur within the next five years
