management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth and discussed below in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is derived from the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  which are included herein  and should be read in conjunction therewith 
company overview kendle international inc the company or kendle is a global clinical research organization cro that delivers integrated clinical development services  including clinical trial management  clinical data management  statistical analysis  medical writing  regulatory consulting and organizational meeting management and publications services  among other things  on a contract basis to the biopharmaceutical industry 
the company operates in north america  europe  asia pacific  latin america and africa 
the company operates its business in two reportable operating segments  early stage and late stage 
the early stage business currently focuses on the company s phase i operations while late stage is comprised of clinical development services related to phase ii through iii clinical trials conducted worldwide  late phase clinical development services related to phase iiib and iv clinical trials conducted worldwide  regulatory affairs and biometrics offerings 
the company aggregates its clinical development reporting unit  regulatory affairs reporting unit  and biometrics reporting unit into the late stage segment under the aggregation criteria in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the aggregation criteria met includes a similar nature of services provided  a similar type of customer  similar methods used to distribute services  similar economic characteristics and a similar regulatory environment 
in addition  the company reports support functions primarily composed of human resources  information technology  sales and marketing and finance under the support and other category for purposes of segment reporting 
a portion of the costs incurred from the support units are allocated to the early and late stage reportable operating segments 
the company s revenue recognition process is described later in this md a under critical accounting policies and estimates 
late stage segment contracts the company provides services to its customers primarily under full service contracts that include a broad range of services in support of a customer s clinical trial 
these services typically include biometrics  clinical development services for phase ii through iv clinical trials and regulatory affairs 
the company from time to time provides a select number of these services under limited service contracts 
the company usually competes for business awards in a competitive bidding process 
in the bidding process  the company submits a bid that includes a price based upon hourly billing rates for billable employees multiplied by task hours the company estimates will be necessary to achieve the service assumptions 
upon receiving a business award  the company and its customer negotiate a contract to memorialize these assumptions and the related price 
service contracts usually are long term arrangements that require company performance over several years 
a contract usually requires a portion of the contract fee to be paid at the time of contract execution  and the balance is received in specified installments or milestones over the contract s duration 
other methods for receiving payment include units achieved and time and materials 
during performance of the services  any of the following events may occur and impact the contract price the customer may request a change in the assumptions  the customer may increase or decrease the scope of services  which requires a change to the service assumptions  and the company may discover that  for a particular contract  the assumptions are incorrect or insufficient to permit completion of the contract 

table of contents in each of the foregoing situations  the company enters into negotiations for a contract amendment to reflect the change in scope or assumptions and the related price 
depending on the complexity of the amendment  the amendment process can take from a few weeks for a simple adjustment  such as a timeline extension  to several months for a complex amendment  such as a change in patient enrollment strategy 
under the company s policy  project teams are not authorized to engage in tasks outside the scope of the contract without prior management approval 
in limited situations  management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while the company and its customer negotiate and finalize the contract amendment 
contract amendments are commonplace within the industry and occur on the majority of the company s contracts 
at any point in time  the company will be in the process of discussing numerous proposed amendments  the scope and value of which can change significantly between time of proposal and final agreement 
the total value of these amendments primarily represents future work and revenues 
in addition to full service and limited service arrangements described above  the company provides consulting services to its customers under contracts that generally are shorter term in nature than full service contracts 
net service revenues from these contracts represent less than of the company s consolidated net service revenues 
in connection with providing services  the company incurs pass through costs  which include travel related expenses for company employees performing services and fees payable to third party investigators or labs participating in  or supporting  the customer s clinical trial 
the customer agrees to reimburse the company on a dollar for dollar basis for the costs incurred by the company in accordance with contractually specified parameters 
the revenues and costs from these pass through and third party costs are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations under the line items titled reimbursable out of pocket revenues and reimbursable out of pocket costs  respectively 
the customer may terminate the contract at any time with little or no advance notice to the company 
customers  in particular  may terminate a contract immediately for concerns related to the efficacy or safety of a particular drug 
upon termination  the customer is required to pay the company for the value of work completed up to termination as well as reimburse the company for its out of pocket costs incurred in accordance with the contract 
although the majority of the company s contracts are fixed price and net service revenues are calculated on a proportional performance or percentage of completion methodology  the company has seen increasing demand from its customers to move toward a units based contract methodology in new contracts 
it is the company s intent to structure more of its contracts under a units based methodology for calculating net service revenues so the company expects the percentage of contracts under which net service revenues are recognized using units based methodology to increase in future periods 
under a units based contract methodology  amounts recognized as net service revenues are calculated based on units completed in the period multiplied by a unit value or selling price that is outlined in the contract 
a contract amendment  which results in revisions to net service revenues and cost estimates  is recognized in revenue calculations beginning in the period in which the parties reach written agreement to the amendment 
early stage segment contracts early stage segment business awards are subject to a competitive bidding process and  upon award  are memorialized in a contract that includes terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the company s contracts with its late stage segment customers 
the early stage segment contract duration is usually substantially less than the late stage segment 
because these business awards require the company to commit beds at its early stage facilities  the company attempts to require the customer to pay a cancellation fee if the customer cancels a project award 
net service revenues from these contracts generally represent less than of the company s consolidated net service revenues 

table of contents acquisitions in june  the company completed its acquisition of decisionline clinical research corporation decisionline and its related company 
decisionline is a clinical research organization located in toronto  ontario specializing in the conduct of early phase studies 
the acquisition supports the overall goal of strategic business expansion  and  in particular  expansion of phase i studies 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding this acquisition 
in august  the company acquired crl clinical services 
the acquisition strengthened the company s position as one of the leading global players in the clinical development industry  adding therapeutic expertise  diversifying its customer base and expanding its capacity to deliver large global trials 
the total purchase price  including acquisition costs and the working capital adjustment  in which the company paid for any working capital in excess of million  was approximately million 
the company financed the purchase with million in term debt as well as its existing cash and proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities 
in april  the company completed its acquisition of ic research

the results of operations for these acquisitions are included in the company s consolidated statements of operations from the dates of acquisition 
for further discussions of these acquisitions  see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
recent developments and cro marketplace the cro industry in general continues to be dependent on the research and development efforts of the principal pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as major customers  and the company believes this dependence will continue 
the loss of business from any of its major customers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the current uncertain economic conditions have caused customers to re evaluate priorities resulting in increases in contracts for the more promising projects  scaling back and or canceling other projects 
the biopharmaceutical industry is reducing costs and  often  their workforce 
the company may benefit from increased outsourcing on the part of its customers or it may be harmed by a reduction in spending 
the company views the current conditions as an opportunity to attract well qualified candidates to strengthen and improve its operations 
another trend noted by the industry is the decline in prescription drug sales caused by cost conscious patients opting for less expensive generic drugs or none at all 
this is both an opportunity and a challenge for the company  as its customers will need to find less costly  more efficient research options often through the establishment of strategic alliances or partnerships 
the company believes it is well positioned for this development 
the current conditions have also impacted the credit environment  making the obtaining of financing difficult for some customers 
the company is proactively monitoring outstanding accounts receivable and strives to remain in a cash positive position on its riskier customers 
in addition  the volatility of currency exchange rate fluctuations has a significant impact on the company as more of its business is earned outside the united states 
fluctuations in exchange rates are not predictable with any degree of accuracy or foreseeable 
in january  the company eliminated a substantial portion of the note payable between the us subsidiary and the us subsidiary 
in connection with this transaction  the company also terminated its pound sterling foreign currency hedge arrangement 
please see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency hedges section for more information 
at december   the value of the hedge arrangement related to the us dollar and pound sterling was approximately million 
at the time of termination of the hedge in january  the company received approximately million in cash proceeds resulting from this termination

no customer accounted for more than of total net service revenues for or reimbursable out of pocket revenues expenses reimbursable out of pocket revenues and expenses fluctuate from period to period due primarily to the level of investigator activity in a particular period 
reimbursable out of pocket revenues and expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is due primarily to an increase in the number of studies in which the company is procuring investigator services as well as to an increase in size of those studies 
operating expenses direct costs increased by from million in to million in the increase in direct costs is attributable to the increased hiring of billable employees to support the growth in the overall business 
direct costs expressed as a percentage of net service revenues were in compared to in the slight increase in direct costs as a percentage of net service revenues in is due in part to additional direct costs of approximately million recorded in the fourth quarter of due to a programming issue unique to one study and one customer

accordingly  no receivable has been recorded at december  related to potential insurance recovery 
any insurance proceeds received would serve to reduce direct costs in future periods

finite lived intangibles are amortized in a manner consistent with the underlying expected future cash flows from the customers  resulting in 
table of contents higher amortization expense in the initial year of acquisition 
in addition  depreciation expense increased as a result of new asset purchases in and the related depreciation thereon 
income from operations in increased to million  or of net service revenues  compared to million  or of net service revenues in the overall decline in operating income as a percentage of net service revenues was due in part to a revenue reduction of million and additional direct costs of million due to the programming issue on one project and the related rework discussed above as well as an overall decline in the utilization of billable associates in compared to the revenue reduction and additional direct costs due to the programming issue is included in the company s support and other category for purposes of segment reporting 
income from operations from kendle s early stage segment in was million  or of net service revenues compared to early stage income from operations of million  or of net service revenues in the primary reason for the increase in operating margin in early stage in was due to operating income from decisionline of approximately million and an increase in operating income at the company s phase i unit in the netherlands

as the company increases its global contracts  it is increasingly exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates 
the exchange rate transaction gains and losses typically occur when the company holds assets and or liabilities in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting location 
with the exception of the hedge arrangements on intercompany notes referred to above  the company does not currently have hedges in place to mitigate exposure due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations

the convertible notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  with the first interest payment having been made on january  the convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder into cash and  if applicable  shares of the company s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share approximating shares per  principal amount of the convertible notes  upon the occurrence of certain events  including any calendar quarter ending after september  in which the closing price of the company s common stock is greater than of the conversion price for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter establishing a contingent conversion price of per share  any five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of convertible notes for each day of that period is equal to or less than of the product of the closing sale price of the company s common stock and the applicable conversion rate  upon specified corporate transactions including consolidation or merger  and any time during the period beginning on january  until the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding july  in addition  upon events defined as a fundamental change under the convertible note indenture  holders of the convertible notes may require the company to repurchase the convertible notes 
if upon the occurrence of such events in which the holders of the convertible notes exercise the conversion provisions of the convertible notes  the company will need to remit the principal balance of the convertible notes to the holders in cash 
as such  the company would be required to classify the entire amount outstanding of the convertible notes as a current liability in the following quarter 
the evaluation of the classification of amounts outstanding associated with the convertible notes will 
table of contents occur every quarter 
as of december   the convertible notes are classified as long term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
upon conversion  holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of the convertible notes to be converted  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of the company s common stock 
if conversion occurs in connection with a fundamental change as defined in the convertible notes indenture  the company may be required to repurchase the convertible notes for cash at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest 
in addition  if conversion occurs in connection with a change in control  the company may be required to deliver additional shares of the company s common stock a make whole premium by increasing the conversion rate with respect to such notes 
the maximum aggregate number of shares that the company would be obligated to issue upon conversion of the convertible notes is million shares  but under most conditions  the company would be obligated to issue million shares upon conversion of the convertible notes

for a discussion of the effects of the convertible notes and the bond hedges and warrants discussed below on earnings per share  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting for the above mentioned convertible notes in future periods will be affected by the issuance of apb please see note  new accounting pronouncements 
concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes  the company purchased convertible bond hedges from the underwriter and jp morgan chase collectively  the counterparties  which are designed to mitigate potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of the company s common stock at the time of exercise is greater than approximately 
under the bond hedges that cover approximately million shares of the company s common stock  the counterparties are required to deliver shares of the company s common stock in the amount that the company is obligated to deliver to the holders of the convertible notes with respect to the conversion  calculated exclusive of shares deliverable by the company by reason of any additional premium relating to the convertible notes or by reason of any election by the company to unilaterally increase the conversion rate pursuant to the indenture governing the convertible notes 
the bond hedges expire at the close of trading on july   which is also the maturity date of the convertible notes although the counterparties will have ongoing obligations with respect to convertible notes properly converted on or prior to that date of which the counterparties have been timely notified 
in addition  the company issued warrants to the counterparties that could require the company to issue up to approximately million shares of the company s common stock on expiration dates consisting of the consecutive business days beginning on and including january  european style 
the strike price is per share  which represented a premium over the closing price of the company s shares of common stock on july  the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes to approximately per share of kendle common stock  representing approximately a premium based on the closing sale price as reported on the nasdaq global market on july   of per share 
the bond hedges and warrants are separate and legally distinct instruments that bind the company and the counterparties and have no binding effect on the holders of the convertible notes 
in addition  pursuant to eitf and eitf  the bond hedges and warrants are accounted for as equity transactions 
therefore  the payment associated with the issuance of the bond hedges and the proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants were recorded as a charge and an increase  respectively  in additional paid in capital in stockholders equity as separate equity transactions 

table of contents for income tax reporting purposes  the company has elected to integrate the convertible notes and the bond hedges 
integration of the bond hedges with the convertible notes creates an original issue discount oid debt instrument for income tax reporting purposes 
therefore  the cost of the bond hedges will be accounted for as interest expense over the term of the convertible notes for income tax reporting purposes 
the associated income tax benefits that are recognized for financial reporting purposes will be recognized as a reduction in the income tax provision in the periods that the deductions are taken for income tax reporting purposes 
the company received net proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes of approximately million after deducting the underwriter s discounts and commissions 
in addition  the company used approximately million of the net proceeds of the offering to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions 
the company made a mandatory prepayment of million of the net proceeds of the offering toward repayment of amounts owed under the term loan under its credit agreement and made additional voluntary prepayments during the third quarter of to pay off the remaining balance of the term loan 
as of december   million was outstanding under the convertible notes  no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit loan and no amounts were outstanding under the multicurrency facility 
the weighted average interest rate in effect on the term loan for the first seven months of was approximately 
the company s primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the payment of salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting expenses  business development costs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and facility related expenses 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the facility and the multicurrency facility  will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs 
the company has not historically experienced regular liquidity or collections issues with the large majority of its customers 
however  the company does have contracts with biotechnology and small pharmaceutical companies  some of which are dependent upon external financing to fund their contractual commitments 
the company is continuing to monitor the financial status of its customers 
in the future  the company will continue to consider the acquisition of businesses to enhance its service offerings  therapeutic base and global presence 
any such acquisitions may require additional external financings and the company may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such financings will be available on terms acceptable to the company

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated financial statements for a particular period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s net service revenues are based on fixed price contracts calculated on a proportional performance basis also referred to herein as percentage of completion based upon assumptions regarding the estimated total costs for each contract 
the company also recognizes revenue under units based contracts by multiplying units completed by the applicable contract per unit price 
additionally  work is performed under time and materials contracts  recognizing revenue as hours are worked based on the hourly billing rate for each contract 
finally  at one of the company s early stage operations  the contracts are of a short term nature and revenue is recognized under the completed contract method of accounting 
percentage of completion with respect to certain fixed price contracts  costs are incurred for performance of each contract and compared to the estimated budgeted costs for that contract to determine a percentage of completion on the contract 
the percentage of completion is then multiplied by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue recognized 
the contract value equals the value of the services to be performed under the contract as determined by aggregating the labor hours estimated to be incurred to perform the tasks in the contract at the agreed rates 
contract value excludes the value of third party and other pass through costs 
as the work progresses  original estimates might be changed as a result of management s regular contract review process 
management regularly reviews the budget on each contract to determine if the budgeted costs accurately reflect the costs that the company will incur for contract performance 
the company reviews each contract s performance to date  current cost trends and circumstances specific to each contract 
the company estimates its remaining costs to complete the contract based on a variety of factors  including actual costs incurred to date and the work completed as a result of incurring the actual costs  the remaining work to be completed based on the timeline of the contract as well as the number of incomplete tasks in the contract  and factors that could change the rate of progress of future contract performance 
examples of factors included in the review process that could change the rate of progress of future contract performance are patient enrollment rate  changes in the composition of staff on the project or other customer requirements  among other things 
based on these contract reviews  the company adjusts its cost estimates 
adjustments to net service revenue resulting from changes in cost estimates are recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
when estimates indicate a loss  such loss is provided in the current period in its entirety 
while the company routinely adjusts cost estimates on individual contracts  the company s estimates and assumptions historically have been accurate in all material respects in the aggregate 
the company expects the estimates and assumptions to remain accurate in all material respects in the aggregate in future periods 
a contract amendment  which results in revisions to net service revenues and cost estimates  is recognized in the percentage of completion calculations beginning in the period in which the parties reach written agreement to the amendment 
see also company overview section of md a for a description of the contract amendment 
table of contents process 
historically  the aggregate value of contract amendments signed in any year represents to of annual sales 
although the majority of the company s contract amendments relate to future services  the company and its customers may execute contract amendments for services that the company already has performed 
in these circumstances  net service revenue from past services performed is recognized in the current period 
historically  the impact of such amendments on results of operations has not been material 
under the company s policy  project teams are not authorized to engage in tasks outside the scope of the contract without prior management approval 
in limited situations  management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while the company and its customer negotiate and finalize the contract amendment 
when work progresses on unsigned  unprocessed contract amendments  the company reviews the direct costs incurred  and  where material defers such costs on the balance sheet 
in addition  the impact of such costs on the estimates to complete is considered and  where material  the estimates are adjusted 
historically  neither the deferred costs nor the impact on estimates have been material 
the company believes that total costs constitute the most appropriate indicator of the performance of fixed price contracts because the costs relate primarily to the amount of labor hours incurred to perform the contract 
the customer receives the benefit of the work performed throughout the contract term and is obligated to pay for services once performed 
accordingly  the company believes that an input measure of cost is a reasonable surrogate for an output measure under the proportional performance model and is consistent with the revenue recognition concepts of staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
units based although the majority of the company s contracts are fixed price and net service revenues are calculated on a percentage of completion methodology as discussed above  the company has seen increasing demand from its customers to move toward a units based contract methodology in new contracts 
it is the company s intent to structure more of its contracts under a units based methodology for calculating net service revenues so the company expects the percentage of contracts under which net service revenues are recognized using units based methodology to increase in future periods 
under a units based contract methodology  amounts recognized as net service revenues are calculated based on units completed in the period multiplied by a unit value or selling price that is outlined in the contract 
for a units based contract  a typical unit could include such things as completion of a monitoring visit  monthly site management units or case report form pages entered 
the company tracks the units completed for each unit category included in the contract 
net service revenue is recognized monthly based on the units actually completed in the period at the agreed upon unit value or selling price 
net service revenue is recognized only up to the number of units contained in each contract 
if the company completes or expects to complete units over and above the number of units initially estimated and contained in the contract  a contract amendment is generated to reflect the additional units needed 
a contract amendment  which results in revisions to net service revenues and expected units or unit values  is recognized in the unit based net service revenue calculations beginning in the period in which the parties agree to the amendment 
see also company overview section of md a for a description of the contract amendment process 
the company believes that under certain types of contracts the value of the work performed is best captured by calculating net service revenues using the value of units completed 
the company believes that units based revenue recognition is consistent with the revenue recognition concepts of sab as the company provides services on projects  it also incurs third party and other pass through costs  which are reimbursable by its customers pursuant to the contract 
the revenues and costs from these third party and other pass through costs are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations under the line items titled reimbursable out of pocket revenues and reimbursable out of pocket costs  respectively 

table of contents direct costs direct costs consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for project related associates  unreimbursed project related costs and an allocated portion of indirect costs  which primarily includes facilities related costs and information systems costs 
labor costs represent over of total direct costs with the allocated portion of indirect costs representing less than of total 
to determine the allocated portion of indirect costs  the company calculates an allocation percentage based on the relationship between billable associate salaries and total salaries 
the remaining indirect costs are allocated to sg a 
because the company s business is labor intensive  direct costs historically have increased with an increase in net service revenues 
the company  however  has not experienced any material variations in the relationship between direct costs and net service revenues for the fiscal years ended  and the following factors  among others  will cause direct costs to decrease as a percentage of net service revenues higher utilization rates for billable employees  and the ability to complete contracted work more efficiently than estimated by the company 
the following factors  among others  will cause direct costs to increase as a percentage of net service revenues the occurrence of cost overruns from increased time to complete contract performance  lower utilization rates for billable employees  increased costs due to higher paid employees or contractors performing contract services  and pricing pressure from increased competition 
the company does not expect that the foregoing factors will have a material impact on the historical relationship between direct costs and net service revenues 
other costs selling  general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for sales and administrative employees and professional services  as well as unallocated costs related to facilities  information systems and other costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization costs recorded on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the property or equipment and internally developed software 
finite lived intangible assets are generally amortized on an accelerated basis based on the discounted cash flow calculations used in the valuation of the asset 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been issued to customers 
unbilled accounts receivable are amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been issued to customers 
advance billings represent amounts billed or payment received for which revenues have not yet been earned 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on historical evidence of accounts receivable collections and specific identification of accounts receivable that might pose collection problems 
the bad debt provision is monitored on a regular basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
with the exception of a million write off in of receivables due from one customer  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has been sufficient to cover any bad debt write offs 
due to the economic climate in the second half of and the tightening of the credit markets  the company increased its bad debt reserve  primarily to cover exposure from a limited number of customers that rely on outside sources to fund their operations 
the company will continue to monitor its bad debt exposure and adjust bad debt reserves as necessary 
if the company is unable to collect all or part of its outstanding receivables  there could be a material impact to the company s consolidated statements of operations or financial position 

table of contents long lived assets the company analyzes goodwill and other finite lived intangible assets to determine any potential impairment loss on an annual basis  unless conditions exist that require an updated analysis on an interim basis 
certain factors that may occur and indicate an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
a fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment 
the fair value approach compares estimates related to the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value is determined using both the market approach and the income approach using projected discounted cash flows 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the company has five reporting units that were tested for impairment early stage  global clinical development  late phase  regulatory affairs and biometrics 
the company determined its reporting units using criteria established in sfas sfas defines a reporting unit as the components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management 
at december  and  the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value  resulting in no goodwill impairment charge 
the estimate of fair value of long lived assets is inherently subjective and requires the company to make a number of assumptions and projections 
these assumptions and projections relate to future net service revenue  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in estimating fair value of its long lived assets  the estimated fair value of these assets could change and result in impairment charges 
please see item a  risk factors for discussion of risks and potential risks that may impact future net service revenues  among other things  of the company 
internally developed software pursuant to the guidance included in statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  the company capitalizes costs incurred to internally develop software used primarily in the company s proprietary clinical trial and data management systems  and amortizes these costs over the useful life of the product  not to exceed five years 
internally developed software represents software in the application development stage  and there is no assurance that the software development process will produce a final product for which the fair value exceeds its carrying value 
internally developed software is an intangible asset subject to impairment write downs whenever events indicate that the carrying value of the software may not be recoverable 
as with other long lived assets  this asset is reviewed at least annually to determine the appropriateness of the carrying value of the asset and the estimated useful lives 
assessing the fair value of the internally developed software requires estimates and judgment on the part of management 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  internally developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life of five years 
the company believes the useful life established remains reasonable 
tax valuation allowance and tax liabilities the company adopted fin as of january  fin requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgments as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate  and  consequently  the company s operating results 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
the company determines its liability for uncertain tax positions globally under the provisions in fin at december   the company has recorded a gross fin liability of million 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the calculation of liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment  a tax expense or benefit to expense  respectively  would result 

table of contents the company provides for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
specifically  the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
because the company conducts business on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings losses among jurisdictions with varying tax rates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
the company has assessed the realization of deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance has been established based on an assessment that it is more likely than not that realization cannot be assured 
the ultimate realization of this tax benefit is dependent upon the generation of sufficient operating income in the respective tax jurisdictions 
if estimates prove inaccurate or if the tax laws change unfavorably  significant revisions in the valuation allowance may be required in the future 
stock based compensation the company adopted the provisions of sfas r for all share based payments granted after january   and for all awards granted to employees prior to january   that remain unvested on january  the company adopted sfas r using a modified prospective application 
the company uses the straight line method of recording compensation expense relative to share based payment 
stock based compensation expense is recorded primarily in general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations as the majority of the stock option expense related to options granted to executives 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that the company records may differ significantly from the expense recorded in the current period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its amounts outstanding under the facility and multicurrency facility 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under either the facility or the multicurrency facility 

table of contents in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement and an interest rate collar arrangement to fix the interest rate on a portion of its debt 
the company fixed the interest rate on the total outstanding balance of the term loan through april  at a fixed rate of plus the margin 
beginning may   the company fixed the interest rate on million of the outstanding term loan at the rate of plus the margin with an additional million covered under the interest rate collar 
the collar provided for interest rate protection at a cap of and a floor of 
these agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
and all changes in the fair market value of the hedge will be recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the company terminated the swap transaction and paid  to reflect the amounts due upon termination of the swap 
total losses related to changes in the fair market value of the interest rate swap and collar arrangements  including the  paid out upon termination of the swap arrangement were approximately million 
in the first quarter of  the company terminated the interest rate collar arrangement and paid approximately million  of which approximately  was accrued at december   to reflect the amounts due upon termination of the collar 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded approximately  in losses related to changes in the fair market value of the interest rate collar arrangement 
foreign currency the company operates on a global basis and is therefore exposed to various types of currency risks 
two specific transaction risks arise from the nature of the contracts the company executes with its customers 
from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular local currency 
this contract currency denomination issue is applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by the company 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net service revenues and resultant net income or loss can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  the company recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing at the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared until the payment from the customer is received will result in the company receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by the company as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
a third type of transaction risk arises from transactions denominated in multiple currencies between any two of the company s various subsidiary locations 
for each subsidiary  the company maintains an intercompany receivable and payable  which is denominated in multiple currencies 
changes in exchange rates from the time the intercompany receivable payable balance arises until the balance is settled or measured for reporting purposes  results in exchange rate gains and losses 
this intercompany receivable payable arises when work is performed by a kendle location in one country on behalf of a kendle location in a different country under contract with the customer 
additionally  there are occasions when funds are transferred between subsidiaries for working capital purposes 
the foreign currency transaction gain or loss is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  the company recorded total foreign exchange losses of approximately million compared to million in related to the risks described above 
as described below  in the first quarter of the company entered into foreign currency hedge transactions to hedge exposure related to intercompany notes between the company s us subsidiary  as lender  and the company s subsidiaries in each of the united kingdom and germany 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial statements 
the 
table of contents company s foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from local currency into us dollars as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments  which are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  were approximately million at december  and million at december  foreign currency hedges in the first quarter of  the company entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to mitigate exposure in movements between the us dollar and british pounds sterling and us dollar and euro 
the hedging transactions are designed to mitigate the company s exposure related to two intercompany notes between the company s us subsidiary  as lender  and the company s subsidiaries in each of the united kingdom and germany 
the note between the company s us subsidiary and united kingdom subsidiary is denominated in pounds sterling and had an outstanding principal amount of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  the note between the company s us subsidiary and german subsidiary is denominated in euros and had an outstanding principal amount of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  the hedge agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
and all changes in the fair market value of the hedge are recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in  the company recorded gains of approximately million on the euro hedge transactions and gains of approximately million on the pound sterling transaction related to the changes in the fair market value of the hedge 
the gains on the fair market value of the hedge were offset by foreign exchange losses of approximately million on the change in value of the euro intercompany note and million on the change in value of the pound sterling intercompany note 
in  the company recorded losses of approximately million on the euro hedge transaction and gains of approximately  on the pound sterling transaction related to the changes in the fair market value of the hedge 
the losses on the fair market value of the hedge were offset by foreign exchange gains of approximately million on the change in value of the euro intercompany note and approximately  on the change in value of the pound sterling intercompany note 
as it relates specifically to the foreign currency hedges discussed above  a change in the us dollar to euro and us dollar to pound sterling exchange rates would impact pre tax income by approximately million in in january  the company eliminated a substantial portion of the note payable between the us subsidiary and the uk subsidiary  referenced above 
in connection with this transaction  the company also terminated its pound sterling foreign currency hedge arrangement referenced above 
at december   the value of the hedge arrangement related to the us dollar and pound sterling was approximately million 
at the time of termination of the hedge in january  the company received approximately million in cash proceeds resulting from this termination
