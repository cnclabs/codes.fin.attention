overview idenix is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases with operations in the united states and europe 
to date  we have successfully developed and received regulatory approval for telbivudine tyzeka sebivo for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus  or hbv  that we licensed to novartis pharma ag  or novartis  and have discovered and developed through proof of concept clinical testing idx  a drug candidate for the treatment of hiv that we licensed to glaxosmithkline  or gsk  in february the gsk license agreement is subject to certain closing conditions 
our current research and development focus is on the treatment of hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
we currently have a nucleoside nucleotide prodrug candidate  idx  for the treatment of hcv in proof of concept clinical testing 
we also have hcv discovery programs focusing on protease inhibitors and non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 
clinical candidates have been selected from each of these two discovery programs and are currently undergoing ind enabling preclinical testing 
the following table summarizes key information regarding tyzeka sebivo and our pipeline of drug candidates indication product drug candidates programs description hbv tyzeka sebivo telbivudine l nucleoside novartis has all development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations related to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo on a worldwide basis 
we receive royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo 
hiv idx non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or nnrti in  we successfully completed a proof of concept clinical study of idx in treatment na ve hiv infected patients 
in february  we granted gsk an exclusive license to develop  manufacture and commercialize idx the gsk license agreement is subject to certain closing conditions 
hcv discovery and development program this program is focused on the three primary classes of drugs for the treatment of hcv  which include nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors  protease inhibitors and non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 

table of contents indication product drug candidates programs description idx and idx nucleotide polymerase inhibitors the most advanced of these efforts is our research on the next generation nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors 
we successfully completed a phase i study in october and are currently evaluating idx in a proof of concept clinical study in treatment naive hcv genotype infected patients 
additionally  we have submitted several ctas in europe for idx idx is in late stage preclinical development 
idx and idx protease inhibitors we have selected idx and idx as our lead clinical candidates from this program and are conducting ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies 
we plan to submit an ind in the united states and a cta in europe for a protease inhibitor drug candidate in  assuming positive results from the ind enabling preclinical studies 
idx non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor we have selected idx as our lead clinical candidate from our non nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitor program 
we are continuing ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies and plan to submit an ind in the united states and a cta in europe for this drug candidate in  assuming positive results from these studies 
all of our drug candidates are currently in preclinical or clinical development 
to commercialize any of our drug candidates  we will be required to obtain marketing authorization approvals after successfully completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of such drug candidates 
we anticipate that we will incur significant additional third party research and development expenses that range from to million for each drug candidate prior to commercial launch 
our current estimates of additional third party research and development expenses do not include the cost of phase iiib iv clinical trials and other clinical trials that are not required for regulatory approval 
we use our employees and our infrastructure resources across several projects  including our product discovery efforts 
we do not allocate our infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the internal costs incurred to date for our drug candidates on a project by project basis 
pursuant to our development  license and commercialization agreement with novartis  which we refer to as the development and commercialization agreement  described more fully below  after it licenses a drug candidate  novartis is obligated to fund development expenses that we incur in accordance with development plans agreed upon by us and novartis 
the option we have granted to novartis with respect to its exclusive right to license our drug candidates generally requires that novartis exercise the option for each such drug candidate after early demonstration of activity and safety in a proof of concept clinical study 
the expenses associated with phase iii clinical trials generally are the most costly component in the development of a successful new product 
pursuant to the license agreement we entered into with gsk in february  which we refer to as the gsk license agreement  described more fully below  gsk is solely responsible for the development  manufacture and commercialization of our nnrti compounds  including idx  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids  on a worldwide basis 
subject to certain conditions  gsk is also responsible for the prosecution of our patents licensed to gsk under the gsk license agreement 
we do not expect to incur any additional development costs relating to our nnrti program  including idx 
table of contents set forth below are the third party research and development expenses incurred for the years ended december   and in connection with our significant preclinical studies and clinical trials disease product drug years ended december  indication candidate in thousands hbv tyzeka sebivo   hbv valtorcitabine   hcv valopicitabine   hcv idx and idx   hcv preclinical discovery program  hiv idx    we have incurred significant losses since our inception in may and expect such losses to continue in the foreseeable future 
historically  we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development activities  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future discovery and development activities  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities together with the million payment expected to be received from gsk in  assuming the gsk license agreement is consummated  and royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs through at least the next twelve months 
if we do not receive the million payment from gsk  we would be able to reduce expenditures to preserve our cash balance and fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
we may seek additional funding through a combination of public or private financing  collaborative relationships and other arrangements in the future 
in september  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  for an indeterminate amount of shares of common stock  up to the aggregate of million  for future issuance 
any financing requiring the issuance of additional shares of capital stock must first be approved by novartis so long as novartis continues to own at least of our voting stock 
our failure to obtain additional funding may require us to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs 
novartis collaboration in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
the collaboration includes the development  license and commercialization agreement  as amended and the master manufacturing and supply agreement between us and novartis 
under the collaboration  novartis paid us a license fee of million for our hbv product and drug candidate  tyzeka sebivo and valtorcitabine  respectively  and provided development funding for tyzeka sebivo and valtorcitabine 
we also received payments of million for achieving two regulatory milestones in effective october   we transferred to novartis our development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations related to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo on a worldwide basis in exchange for royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales  with such percentage increasing according to specified tiers of net sales 
the royalty percentage will vary based upon the territory and the aggregate dollar amount of net sales 
currently  tyzeka sebivo has received regulatory approval for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis b in more than countries around the world  including the united states  china  switzerland and the countries included in the european union 
we do not expect to receive any additional regulatory milestones for telbivudine or valtorcitabine from novartis 
under the development and commercialization agreement  novartis exercised its option to license valopicitabine for the treatment of hcv and paid us a license fee of million  a million milestone payment based upon results from our phase i clinical trial and provided development funding for the drug candidate 
in july  we announced that the fda had placed on clinical hold in the united states our development program of valopicitabine for the treatment of hcv based on the overall risk benefit profile observed in clinical testing 
we 
table of contents subsequently discontinued the development of valopicitabine 
as a result  we do not expect to receive any additional license fees or milestone payments for valopicitabine from novartis 
in addition to the collaboration described above  novartis purchased approximately of our outstanding capital stock in may from our then existing stockholders for million in cash  with an additional aggregate amount of up to million contingently payable to these stockholders if we achieve predetermined development milestones relating to specific hcv drug candidates 
the future contingent payments are payable in cash or  under certain circumstances  novartis ag american depository shares 
as of february   novartis owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
we derived substantially all of our total revenues from novartis in  and through the recognition of license fees  milestone payments  development expense reimbursements  tyzeka product sales in the united states prior to october  sebivo product sales outside of the united states prior to october and royalty payments associated with the sales of tyzeka sebivo 
we anticipate recognizing additional revenues from our collaboration with novartis 
these revenues include additional development expense funding for our hcv drug candidate and other drug candidates that novartis may elect to subsequently license from us  as well as  regulatory milestones and  if products are approved for sale  commercialization milestones and revenues derived from sales by us or novartis of our licensed drug candidates 
gsk collaboration in february  we entered into the following agreements with gsk a license agreement whereby we granted gsk an exclusive license to develop  manufacture and commercialize our nnrti compounds  including idx  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids  on a worldwide basis  and a stock purchase agreement  which we refer to as the gsk stock purchase agreement  under which gsk will purchase  shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million  or a per share price of 
pursuant to the gsk license agreement  gsk is solely responsible for the development  manufacture and commercialization of our nnrti compounds  including idx  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids  on a worldwide basis 
subject to certain conditions  gsk is also responsible for the prosecution of our patents licensed to gsk under the gsk license agreement 
under the gsk license agreement and the gsk stock purchase agreement  we anticipate receiving a million payment in  which includes the million payment under the gsk stock purchase agreement 
pursuant to the gsk license agreement  we could also potentially receive up to million in development  regulatory and sales milestones 
we also will be entitled to receive double digit tiered royalties on worldwide sales of products containing idx the parties have agreed that if gsk  its affiliates or its sublicensees desire to develop idx for an indication other than hiv  or if gsk develops any other licensed compound for any indication  the parties will mutually agree on a separate schedule of milestone and royalty payments prior to the start of development 
royalties are payable until the later to occur of i the last to expire of specified patent rights in a country  or ii ten years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country  provided that if royalties are payable solely on the basis of the ten year anniversary of the first commercial sale of a product  each of the respective royalty rates in such country would be reduced by one half 
royalties for combination products are determined based on the contribution of the licensed compound to the overall sales or value of the combination product 
in addition  royalties payable under the gsk license agreement will be subject to reduction on account of third party license payments or generic competition  with any such reductions capped at certain percentages of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period 
the royalties will also be subject to reduction in the event that in a calendar quarter the fully allocated cost of goods for the manufacture of a product sold in certain countries as a percentage of the net sales of such product exceeds a specified threshold 
the gsk license agreement is subject to certain closing conditions  including hsr clearance 
of the million payment we anticipate receiving  gsk will make a one time cash payment of million and will purchase  shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 
table of contents million  or a per share price of 
under the terms of a stock purchase agreement entered into with gsk relating to the purchase of our capital stock  we have agreed to file with the sec  within days following the date of the closing  a registration statement covering the shares gsk purchased from us 
we have also agreed to cooperate in one underwritten offering of the purchased shares  including the entry into an underwriting agreement with customary terms  provided that such underwritten offering occurs after the first anniversary of the closing date 
the gsk stock purchase agreement may be terminated under the following conditions by mutual written agreement of the parties  by either party if a closing does not occur within days following the filings made in connection with the hsr clearance  or by either us or gsk in the event that a governmental entity issues a final and nonappealable order  decree or injunction or takes any action to restrain  enjoin or prohibit the transactions contemplated by the gsk stock purchase agreement 
until such time as we receive hsr clearance  we cannot guarantee that the gsk license agreement and gsk stock purchase agreement will become effective and therefore we cannot guarantee that we will receive the million payment 
gsk may terminate the license agreement  in its sole discretion  by providing us with days written notice 
if either we or gsk materially breach the gsk license agreement and do not cure such breach within days  the non breaching party may terminate the gsk license agreement in its entirety 
either party may also terminate the gsk license agreement  effective immediately if the other party files for bankruptcy  is dissolved or has a receiver appointed for substantially all of its property 
we may terminate the gsk license agreement if gsk  its affiliates or its sublicensees challenges the validity or enforceability of the patents licensed to gsk under the gsk license agreement 
under the gsk license agreement and the gsk stock purchase agreement  we have agreed to indemnify gsk and its affiliates against losses suffered as a result of our breach of representations and warranties in these agreements 
we made numerous representations and warranties to gsk regarding our nnrti program  including idx  including representations regarding our ownership of the inventions and discoveries 
if one or more of our representations or warranties were not true at the time we made them to gsk  we would be in breach of these agreements 
in the event of a breach by us  gsk has the right to seek indemnification from us for damages suffered as a result of such breach 
the amounts for which we could be liable to gsk may be substantial 
novartis waived certain rights under the development and commercialization agreement 
specifically  subject to certain retained rights  novartis waived its rights to the intellectual property that covers the compounds licensed to gsk 
novartis also agreed that the compounds licensed to gsk are deemed rejected compounds under the development and commercialization agreement 
in addition  we represented and warranted to novartis that neither we nor our affiliates or licensees or their successors and assigns would assert infringement claims against novartis or certain of its related entities or their successors and assigns if such entities exercise limited rights under a subset of the patent rights licensed to gsk 
pursuant to the amended and restated stockholders agreement  novartis also executed a waiver and consent whereby novartis consented to the sale by us of the  shares to gsk  approved entering into the gsk license agreement  waived its rights to buy a pro rata portion of the shares issued to gsk  approved our granting of registration rights to gsk and waived its rights to participate in such registration  and waived  until a certain time  its rights to request that we file a registration statement on novartis behalf or include shares of our common stock owned by novartis in any such registration statement filed on behalf of gsk 

table of contents these waivers and approvals are only effective if immediately after the issuance of the  shares to gsk  novartis continues to hold over of our common stock 
in january  we also amended the development and commercialization agreement to provide that novartis retains the exclusive option to obtain rights to other drug candidates developed by us  or in some cases licensed to us  so long as novartis maintains ownership of of our common stock  rather than ownership of of our common stock  as was the requirement prior to the execution of this amendment 
this amendment will be null and void if the gsk license agreement and the gsk stock purchase agreement do not become effective 
additionally  in january  we also amended an agreement with novartis providing that so long as novartis and its affiliates own at least of our common stock  novartis consent is required for the selection and appointment of our chief financial officer 
prior to the execution of this letter amendment  the ownership requirement was 
if in novartis reasonable judgment the chief financial officer is not satisfactorily performing his or her duties  we are required to terminate his or her employment 
this letter amendment will be null and void if the gsk license agreement and the gsk stock purchase agreement do not become effective 
lastly  as part of the transactions with gsk  at the time of the effectiveness of the gsk license agreement  gsk will become a party to the cooperative research program and exclusive license agreement we have with the university of cagliari  the co owner of certain patents and patent applications licensed by us to gsk under the gsk license agreement 
under these arrangements  we will make certain payments to the universita degli studi di cagliari  or university of cagliari  based on the million payment expected to be received from gsk in and may make future payments to the university of cagliari in certain instances 
although certain patent rights licensed to gsk are owned solely by us and do not fall under the arrangements with the university of cagliari  we have entered into an arrangement whereby if it is ever deemed that any patent owned solely by us and licensed to gsk was co developed by anyone on the faculty of the university of cagliari  such co development would fall squarely within our existing arrangements with the university of cagliari and no additional payments would be due by us

pursuant to the license agreement between us and the university of alabama at birmingham  or the uab license agreement  we were granted an exclusive license to the rights that the university of alabama at birmingham research foundation  or uabrf  an affiliate of the university of alabama at birmingham  or uab  emory university and the le centre national de la recherche scientifique  or cnrs  collectively the licensors  have to a us patent application and progeny thereof and counterpart patent applications in europe  canada  japan and australia that cover the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of hbv virus 
in july  the company entered into a settlement agreement with uab  uabrf and emory university relating to the company s telbivudine technology 
pursuant to this settlement agreement  all contractual disputes relating to patents covering the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of the hbv virus and all litigation matters relating to patents and patent applications related to the use of l deoxy nucleosides for the 
table of contents treatment of hbv assigned to one or more of the company  cnrs and the university of montpellier and which cover the use of tyzeka sebivo telbivudine for the treatment of hbv have been resolved 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid uabrf on behalf of uab and emory university a million upfront payment and will make additional payments to uabrf equal to of all royalty payments received by us from novartis from worldwide sales of telbivudine  subject to minimum payment obligations aggregating million 
our payment obligations under the settlement agreement expire on august  the settlement agreement was effective on june  and included mutual releases of all claims and covenants not to sue among the parties 
it also included a release from a third party scientist who had claimed to have inventorship rights in certain idenix cnrs university of montpellier patents 
additionally  in connection with the resolution of matters relating to certain of our hcv drug candidates we entered into a settlement agreement with uab which provides for a milestone payment of million to uab upon receipt of regulatory approval in the united states to market and sell certain hcv products invented or discovered by our ceo during the period from november  to november  this settlement agreement also allows for payments in an amount equal to of worldwide net sales of such hcv products with a minimum sales based payment equal to million 
further  we have potential payment obligations under the license agreement with the university of cagliari pursuant to which we have the exclusive worldwide right to make  use and sell certain hcv and hiv technologies 
we will make certain payments to the university of cagliari under these arrangements based on the million payment we expect to receive in from gsk under the gsk license agreement 
we are also liable for certain payments to the university of cagliari if we receive from novartis or another collaborator license fees or milestone payments with respect to such technology 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals corporation or sumitomo  under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may the settlement agreement which we entered into with sumitomo provides for a million milestone payment to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
as part of the development and commercialization agreement  novartis will reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
in october  we entered into a two year research collaboration agreement with metabasis therapeutics  inc or metabasis 
under the terms of the agreement  metabasis proprietary liver targeted technology would have been applied to one of our compounds to develop second generation nucleoside analog drug candidates for the treatment of hcv 
in july  we notified metabasis that we would exercise our option to terminate the research collaboration on the first anniversary of the agreement in october prior to the termination of the agreement  metabasis asserted that a certain scientific milestone was met and thus a million payment under the collaboration agreement came due 
we do not agree with metabasis assessment that the scientific milestone has been met and therefore do not believe that we have any liability for this payment and initially so notified metabasis 
in may  we and metabasis entered into a letter agreement whereby metabasis will apply its proprietary liver targeted technology to a compound developed by us 
if the results are considered positive  as measured by efficacy and safety in a predictive animal study  then we anticipate re instating the original agreement with metabasis  which was terminated in october if the original agreement with metabasis were to be re instated  then we would remain obligated to all the terms and conditions thereunder  including the million milestone payment 
in december  we retained the services of clariant subsequently acquired by archimica group  a provider of manufacturing services in the specialty chemicals industry  in the form of a multiproject development and supply agreement 
under the terms of the agreement with clariant  we would  on an as needed basis  utilize the clariant process development and manufacture services in the development of certain of our drug candidates  including telbivudine 
after reviewing respective bids from each of novartis and clariant  the joint manufacturing committee decided to proceed with novartis as the primary manufacturer of telbivudine 
in late  we transferred full responsibility to novartis for the development  commercialization and manufacturing of telbivudine 
as a result  in january  we exercised our right under the agreement with clariant to terminate 
table of contents effective july in february  clariant asserted that they should have been able to participate in the manufacturing process for telbivudine as a non primary supplier and are due an unspecified amount 
we do not agree with clariant s assertion and therefore have not recorded a liability associated with this potential contingent matter 
clariant has not initiated legal proceedings 
if legal proceedings are initiated  we intend to vigorously defend against such lawsuit 
off balance sheet transactions we currently have no off balance sheet transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to collaborative research and development revenue recognition  accrued expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  we believe that the following critical accounting policies are important to the understanding and evaluating of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues relating to our collaborative research and development arrangements in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab we record revenue provided that there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
if we do not believe that collection of amounts billed  or amounts to be billed to our collaborators  is reasonably assured  then we defer revenue recognition 
collaboration revenue collaboration revenue consists of nonrefundable license fees  milestones  collaborative research and development funding and royalties received from our collaborative partners 
we account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets under emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf no 
the provisions of eitf no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into on or after july  where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement  non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue over the expected development period as we complete our performance obligations 
when our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period or no other performance pattern is evident  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on the part of management 
payments received from collaborative partners for research and development efforts by us are recognized as revenue over the contract term as the related costs are incurred  net of any amounts due to the collaborative partner for costs incurred during the period for shared development costs 
revenues from milestones related to an arrangement under which we have continuing performance obligations  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is nonrefundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve 
table of contents the milestone  and the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended 
if any of these conditions is not met  the milestone payment is deferred and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations 
where we have no continuing involvement under a collaborative arrangement  we record non refundable license fee revenue when we have a contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement  and we record milestones when we receive appropriate notification from the collaborative partner of achievement of the milestones by the collaborative partner 
collaboration revenue related party in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
this agreement has several joint committees in which we and novartis participate 
we participate in these committees as a means to govern or protect our interests 
the committees span the period from early development through commercialization of drug candidates licensed by novartis 
as a result of applying the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  which was the applicable revenue guidance at the time the collaboration was entered into  our revenue recognition policy attributes revenue to the development period of the drug candidates licensed under the development and commercialization agreement 
we have not attributed revenue to our involvement in the committees following the commercialization of the licensed products as we have determined that our participation on the committees as such participation relates to the commercialization of drug candidates is protective 
our determination is based in part on the fact that our expertise is  and has been  the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases 
novartis  on the other hand  has and continues to possess the considerable commercialization expertise and infrastructure necessary for the commercialization of such drug candidates 
accordingly  we believe our obligation post commercialization is inconsequential 
we recognize license fee payments over the performance period of our continuing obligations 
this period is estimated based on current judgments related to the product development timeline of our licensed product and drug candidates and currently it is estimated to be approximately twelve and a half years following the effective date of the development and commercialization agreement that we entered into with novartis  or december we review our assessment and judgment on a quarterly basis with respect to the expected duration of the development period of our licensed drug candidates 
if the estimated performance period changes  we will adjust the periodic revenue that is being recognized and will record the remaining unrecognized license fee payments over the remaining development period during which our performance obligations will be completed 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
upon the grant of options and stock awards under stock incentive plans  with the exception of the equity incentive plan  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less the exercise price  if any  payable by the option or award holder  is recorded as a reduction of the license fees associated with the novartis collaboration 
the amount is attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized through that date and the remaining amount of deferred revenue 
these amounts will be adjusted through the date that novartis elects to purchase the shares to maintain its percentage ownership based upon changes in the value of our common stock and in novartis percentage ownership 
for the year ended december  the impact of novartis stock subscription rights has reduced the license fee by million  which has been recorded as additional paid in capital 
of this amount  million has been recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue as of december  with the remaining amount of million recorded as a reduction of license fee revenue 
as of december   the aggregate impact of novartis stock subscription rights has reduced the license fee by million  which has been recorded as additional paid in capital 
of this amount  million has been recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue with the remaining amount of million as a reduction of license fee revenue 
royalty revenue consists of revenue earned under our license agreement with novartis for sales of tyzeka sebivo  which is recognized when reported from novartis 
royalty revenue is equal to a percentage of tyzeka sebivo net sales  with such percentage increasing according to specified tiers of net sales 
the royalty percentage varies based upon the territory and the aggregate dollar amount of net sales 

table of contents deferred revenue in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals corporation or sumitomo  under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may we repurchased these product rights for million 
the repurchase of these rights resulted in a million reversal of revenue that we previously recognized under our original arrangements with sumitomo 
we recorded the remaining amount of million as a reduction of deferred revenue 
we have also included million in deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet at december  representing amounts received from sumitomo that we have not included in our revenue to date 
we are required to pay an additional million to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
this payment will be recorded first as a reduction of the remaining million of deferred revenue  with the excess recorded as an expense 
as part of the development and commercialization agreement  novartis will reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
if regulatory approval is not received for telbivudine in japan  we would have no further obligations under the settlement agreement with sumitomo and  therefore  the million of remaining deferred revenue would be recognized as revenue at that time 
valuation and impairment of investments and or marketable securities as of january   we implemented statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
 for our financial assets and other items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
sfas no 
clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  sfas no 
established a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
with the exception of our holding in an auction rate security  our marketable securities are generally valued using information provided by a pricing service based on market observable information  or for money market investments  at calculated net asset values 
because our investment portfolio includes many fixed income securities that do not always trade on a daily basis  the pricing service applied other available information as applicable through processes such as benchmark yields  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare evaluations 
in addition  model processes were used to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios 
these models take into consideration relevant credit information  perceived market movements  sector news and economic events 
the inputs into these models may include benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads and other relevant data 
we validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used  obtaining market values from other sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances 
since our investment in an auction rate security typically does not actively trade  it was classified as level in accordance with sfas no 
we determined the fair value of the security based on a discounted cash flow model which incorporated a discount period  coupon rate  liquidity discount  and coupon history 
we also considered in determining the fair value the rating of the security by investment rating agencies and whether or not the security was backed by the us government 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of 
table of contents service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees  such as amounts due to clinical research organizations  professional service fees  such as attorneys and accountants  and investigators in conjunction with preclinical and clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of materials related to our drug candidates  and third party expenses relating to marketing efforts associated with commercialization of our product and drug candidates 
accruals for amounts due to clinical research organizations are among our most significant estimates 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services incurred by the service providers 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us and account for these estimates in accordance with accounting principles involving accrued expenses and income tax liabilities generally accepted in the united states 
stock based compensation we recognize share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires share based transactions for employees and directors to be accounted for using a fair value based method that results in expense being recognized in our financial statements 
we make assumptions related to the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term of the awards granted in order to value and expense our share based compensation 
the expected option term and expected volatility are determined by examining the expected option term and volatility of our own stock as well as those of similarly sized biotechnology companies 
we review these assumptions periodically 
the amounts recognized for stock based compensation expense could vary depending upon changes in these assumptions 
share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in  and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and should be reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods as options vest  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
during  and  because substantially all of the company s stock option grants vest monthly  no forfeiture assumption was applied 
we recognize compensation expense for stock options granted to non employees in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf eitf requires such equity instruments to be recorded at their fair value at the measurement date  which is generally the vesting date of the instruments 
therefore  the measurement of stock based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest 
our equity incentive plans are administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors 
the compensation committee determines the type and term of each award  the award exercise or purchase price  if applicable  the number of shares underlying each award granted and the rate at which each award becomes vested or exercisable 
incentive stock options may be granted only to employees at an exercise price per share not less than the fair market value per share of common stock as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant not less than of the fair market value in the case of holders of more than of our common stock and with a term not to exceed ten years from the date of grant five years for incentive stock options granted to holders of more than of our voting common stock 
nonqualified stock options may be granted to any officer  employee  director  consultant or advisor at a per share exercise price not less than the fair market value per share of common stock as determined by the compensation committee on the date of grant 
the compensation committee may also grant restricted stock and other stock based awards on terms and conditions it may determine 
these equity incentive plans are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of our consolidated statements of operations  we have allocated stock based compensation to expense categories based on the nature of the service provided by the recipients of the stock option and restricted stock grants 
we expect to continue to grant options to purchase common stock in the future 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position  fsp no 
 determining fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active fsp no 

fsp no 
demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp no 
was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  fsp no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 fsp no 
was issued 
fsp no 
defers the effective date provision of sfas no 
for certain non financial assets and liabilities until fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
for certain non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in our financial statements on a non recurring basis 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property  eitf was issued 
eitf prescribes the accounting for collaborations 
it requires certain transactions between collaborators to be recorded in the income statement on either a gross or net basis within expenses when certain characteristics exist in the collaboration relationship 
eitf is effective for all of our collaborations existing after january  we are evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk changes in interest rates may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
the potential change in fair value of our marketable securities for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million to our interest rate sensitive instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital  while maintaining liquidity  until it is required to fund operations 
to minimize risk  we maintain our operating cash in commercial bank accounts 
we invest our excess cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  us government guaranteed debt obligations and corporate debt securities 
due to the failed auctions related to our auction rate security in and the continued uncertainty in the credit markets  the market value of our securities may decline and may prevent us from liquidating our holdings 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have subsidiaries in europe that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by novartis on sales of sebivo outside of the us as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates
