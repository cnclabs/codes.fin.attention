item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview leasing objectives  for a discussion of our tenants currently in bankruptcy 
we face uncertainties relating to lease renewals and re letting of space 
upon the expiration of current leases for space located in our properties  we may not be able to re let all or a portion of that space  or the terms of re letting including the cost of concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms or market rates 
if we are unable to re let promptly all or a substantial portion of the space located in our properties or if the rental rates we receive upon re letting are significantly lower than current rates  our earnings and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected due to the resulting reduction in rent receipts and increase in our property operating costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain tenants in any of our properties upon the expiration of their leases 
we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions 
we have incurred  and may continue to incur  indebtedness in furtherance of our activities 
neither our amended and restated declaration of trust nor any policy statement formally adopted by our board of trustees limits either the total amount of indebtedness or the specified percentage of indebtedness that we may incur 
accordingly  we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions 
market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our borrowing costs and profitability and can adversely affect our share price 
we have exposure to market risks relating to increases in interest rates due to our variable rate debt 
an increase in interest rates may increase our costs of borrowing on existing variable rate indebtedness  leading to a reduction in our earnings 
as of december   we had outstanding million in consolidated variable rate indebtedness  not subject to an interest rate swap agreement 
the level of our variable rate indebtedness  along with the interest rate associated with such variable rate indebtedness  may change in the future and materially affect our interest costs and earnings 
in addition  our interest costs on our fixed rate indebtedness can increase if we are required to refinance our fixed rate indebtedness at maturity at higher interest rates 
furthermore  the public valuation of our common shares is related primarily to the earnings that we derive from rental income with respect to our properties and not from the underlying appraised value of the properties themselves 
as a result  interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions can affect the market value of our common shares 
for instance  if interest rates rise  the market price of our common shares may decrease because potential investors seeking a higher dividend yield than they would receive from our common shares may sell our common shares in favor of higher rate interest bearing securities 
recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 
the united states credit markets have experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets  making financing terms for borrowers less attractive  and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing at reasonable terms  which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions 
a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell  as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 
these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the united states  which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common shares or preferred shares 
these disruptions in the financial markets may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally 
we also have interest rate swap agreements directly and through our investment in lex win concord and have a direct forward equity commitment 
the counterparties of these arrangements are major financial institutions  however  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties 
in addition  we may be required to make additional prepayments pursuant to our forward equity commitment 
we face risks associated with refinancings 
a significant number of our properties  as well as corporate level borrowings  are subject to mortgage or other secured notes with balloon payments due at maturity 
as of december   the consolidated scheduled balloon payments  including discontinued operations  for the next five calendar years  are as follows year balloon payments million million million million million subsequent to december   million of the debt has been extended to as of december   the scheduled balloon payments for our non consolidated entities for the next five calendar years are as follows year balloon payments balloon payments our proportionate share million million million million million million million million million million our ability to make the scheduled balloon payments will depend upon our cash balances  the amount available under our credit facility and our ability either to refinance the related mortgage debt or to sell the related property 
certain of our properties are cross collateralized and certain of our indebtedness is cross defaulted 
as of december   the mortgages on two sets of two properties  one set of four properties and one set of three properties are cross collateralized 
in addition  our new credit facility is secured by a borrowing base of interests in properties  our million original principal amount secured term loan of which million was outstanding at december  is secured by a borrowing base of interests in properties  and our million secured term loan is secured by a borrowing base of interests in three properties 
to the extent that any of our properties are cross collateralized  any default by us under the mortgage note relating to one property will result in a default under the financing arrangements relating to any other property that also provides security for that mortgage note or is cross collateralized with such mortgage note 
in addition  our credit facility  secured term loans and exchangeable guaranteed notes contain cross default provisions which may be triggered if we default on indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds 
we face possible liability relating to environmental matters 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations  as an owner of real property  we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  in or under our properties  as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances 
these liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
these laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence or disposal of those substances 
this liability may be imposed on us in connection with the activities of an operator of  or tenant at  the property 
the cost of any required remediation  removal  fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and or our aggregate assets 
in addition  the presence of those substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remove those substances  may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow using that property as collateral  which  in turn  would reduce our revenues and ability to make distributions 
a property can also be adversely affected either through physical contamination or by virtue of an adverse effect upon value attributable to the migration of hazardous or toxic substances  or other contaminants that have or may have emanated from other properties 
although our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased premises  in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy any obligations with respect to the property leased to that tenant  we may be required to satisfy such obligations 
in addition  we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease 
from time to time  in connection with the conduct of our business  we authorize the preparation of phase i environmental reports and  when necessary  phase ii environmental reports  with respect to our properties 
based upon these environmental reports and our ongoing review of our properties  as of the date of this annual report  we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that the environmental reports will reveal all environmental conditions at our properties or that the following will not expose us to material liability in the future the discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions  changes in law  activities of tenants  or activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of our tenants  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
uninsured losses or a loss in excess of insured limits could adversely affect our financial condition 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rent loss insurance on most of our properties  with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar properties 
however  with respect to those properties where the leases do not provide for abatement of rent under any circumstances  we generally do not maintain rent loss insurance 
in addition  there are certain types of losses  such as losses resulting from wars  terrorism or certain acts of god that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose capital invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss of these types would adversely affect our financial condition 
future terrorist attacks and the military conflicts could have a material adverse effect on general economic conditions  consumer confidence and market liquidity 
among other things  it is possible that interest rates may be affected by these events 
an increase in interest rates may increase our costs of borrowing  leading to a reduction in our earnings 
these types of terrorist acts could also result in significant damages to  or loss of  our properties 
we and our tenants may be unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable economic terms for losses resulting from acts of terrorism 
our lenders may require that we carry terrorism insurance even if we do not believe this insurance is necessary or cost effective 
we may also be prohibited under the applicable lease from passing all or a portion of the cost of such insurance through to the tenant 
should an act of terrorism result in an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits  we could lose capital invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss of these types would adversely affect our financial condition 
competition may adversely affect our ability to purchase properties 
there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies  financial institutions and other investors with greater financial resources than we have that compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and tenants who will lease space in our properties 
due to our focus on net lease properties located throughout the united states  and because most competitors are locally and or regionally focused  we do not encounter the same competitors in each market 
our competitors include other real estate investment trusts  or reits  financial institutions  insurance companies  pension funds  private companies and individuals 
this competition may result in a higher cost for properties that we wish to purchase 
our failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and share price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards may be modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of moreover  effective internal controls  particularly those related to revenue recognition  are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and to maintain our qualification as a reit and are important to helping prevent financial fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  our reit qualification could be jeopardized  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our shares could drop significantly 
we may have limited control over our co investment programs and joint venture investments 
our co investment programs and joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by us  including the possibility that our partner might  at any time  become bankrupt  have different interests or goals than we do  or take action contrary to our instructions  requests  policies or objectives  including our policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a reit 
other risks of co investment programs and joint venture investments include impasse on decisions  such as a sale  because neither we nor our partner have full control over the co investment programs or joint venture 
also  there is no limitation under our organizational documents as to the amount of funds that may be invested in co investment programs and joint ventures 
one of our co investment programs  lex win concord  is owned equally by us and winthrop 
this co investment program is managed by the members 
material actions taken by lex win concord require the consent of each of us and winthrop 
accordingly  lex win concord may not take certain actions or invest in certain assets even if we believe it to be in its best interest 
michael l 
ashner  our former executive chairman and director of strategic acquisitions is also the chairman and chief executive officer of each of winthrop and wrp sub management llc  the administrative manager of lex win concord 
another co investment program  nls  is managed by an executive committee comprised of three persons appointed by us and two persons appointed by our partner 
with few exceptions  the vote of four members of the executive committee is required to conduct business 
accordingly  we do not control the business decisions of this co investment 
investments by our co investment programs may conflict with our ability to make attractive investments 
under the terms of the limited partnership agreement governing nls  we are required to first offer to nls all opportunities to acquire real estate assets which  among other criteria  are specialty in nature and net leased 
only if nls elects not to approve the acquisition opportunity or the applicable exclusivity conditions have expired  may we pursue the opportunity directly 
as a result  we may not be able to make attractive acquisitions directly and may only receive an interest in such acquisitions through our interest in nls 
in addition  the agreements governing lex win concord and concord may restrict our ability to make certain debt investments 
certain of our trustees and officers may face conflicts of interest with respect to sales and refinancings 
e 
robert roskind and richard j 
rouse  our chairman  and vice chairman and chief investment officer  respectively  each own limited partner interests in certain of our operating partnerships  and as a result  may face different and more adverse tax consequences than our other shareholders will if we sell certain properties or reduce mortgage indebtedness on certain properties 
those individuals may  therefore  have different objectives than our other shareholders regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any sale of such properties or reduction of mortgage debt 
accordingly  there may be instances in which we may not sell a property or pay down the debt on a property even though doing so would be advantageous to our other shareholders 
in the event of an appearance of a conflict of interest  the conflicted trustee or officer must recuse himself or herself from any decision making or seek a waiver of our code of business conduct and ethics 
our ability to change our portfolio is limited because real estate investments are illiquid 
equity investments in real estate are relatively illiquid and  therefore  our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changed conditions will be limited 
our board of trustees may establish investment criteria or limitations as it deems appropriate  but currently does not limit the number of properties in which we may seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one geographic region 
we could change our investment  disposition and financing policies without a vote of our shareholders 
there can be no assurance that we will remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we have met the requirements for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december   and we intend to continue to meet these requirements in the future 
however  qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code  for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
no assurance can be given that we have qualified or will remain qualified as a reit 
the code provisions and income tax regulations applicable to reits are more complex than those applicable to corporations 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to continue to qualify as a reit 
in addition  no assurance can be given that legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements for qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
if we do not qualify as a reit  we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our net taxable income 
in addition  our income would be subject to tax at the regular corporate rates 
we also could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be significantly reduced for each year in which we do not qualify as a reit 
in that event  we would not be required to continue to make distributions 
although we currently intend to continue to qualify as a reit  it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause us  without the consent of the shareholders  to revoke the reit election or to otherwise take action that would result in disqualification 
we may be subject to the reit prohibited transactions tax  which could result in significant us federal income tax liability to us 
we previously announced a restructuring of our investment strategy  focusing on core and core plus assets 
a real estate investment trust will incur a tax on the net income from a prohibited transaction 
generally  a prohibited transaction includes a sale or disposition of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
while we believe that the dispositions of our assets pursuant to the restructuring of our investment strategy should not be treated as prohibited transactions  whether a particular sale will be treated as a prohibited transaction depends on the underlying facts and circumstances 
we have not sought and do not intend to seek a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding any dispositions 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our dispositions of such assets will not be subject to the prohibited transactions tax 
if all or a significant portion of those dispositions were treated as prohibited transactions  we would incur a significant us federal income tax liability  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 
to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our taxable income for that calendar year 
our taxable income is determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we will incur a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of i of our ordinary income for that year  ii of our capital gain net income for that year and iii of our undistributed taxable income from prior years 
we intend to continue to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to reduce exposure to federal income and nondeductible excise taxes 
differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in determining our income and the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a short term basis in order to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 
certain limitations limit a third party s ability to acquire us or effectuate a change in our control 
limitations imposed to protect our reit status 
in order to protect us against the loss of our reit status  our declaration of trust limits any shareholder from owning more than in value of any class of our outstanding shares  subject to certain exceptions 
the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us 
severance payments under employment agreements 
substantial termination payments may be required to be paid under the provisions of employment agreements with certain of our executives upon a change of control 
we have entered into employment agreements with four of our executive officers which provide that  upon the occurrence of a change in control of us including a change in ownership of more than of the total combined voting power of our outstanding securities  the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  dissolution  the acquisition  except from us  of or more of our voting shares or a change in the majority of our board of trustees  those executive officers may be entitled to severance benefits based on their current annual base salaries  recent annual cash bonuses and the average of the value of the two most recent long term incentive awards as defined in the employment agreements 
accordingly  these payments may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
limitation due to our ability to issue preferred shares 
our amended and restated declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to issue preferred shares  without shareholder approval 
the board of trustees is able to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued which could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us  even if a change in control were in shareholders best interests 
at december   we had outstanding  series b preferred shares  that we issued in june   series c preferred shares  that we issued in december and january  and  series d preferred shares  that we issued in february our series b  series c and series d preferred shares include provisions that may deter a change of control 
the establishment and issuance of shares of our existing series of preferred shares or a future series of preferred shares could make a change of control of us more difficult 
limitation imposed by the maryland business combination act 
the maryland general corporation law  as applicable to maryland reits  establishes special restrictions against business combinations between a maryland reit and interested shareholders or their affiliates unless an exemption is applicable 
an interested shareholder includes a person who beneficially owns  and an affiliate or associate of the trust who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting shares  but a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have been an interested shareholder 
among other things  maryland law prohibits for a period of five years a merger and certain other transactions between a maryland reit and an interested shareholder 
the five year period runs from the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder 
thereafter  any such business combination must be recommended by the board of trustees and approved by two super majority shareholder votes unless  among other conditions  the common shareholders receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its shares 
the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions  including business combinations that are exempted by the board of trustees prior to the time that the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
the business combination statute could have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers  even if such acquisition would be in shareholders best interests 
in connection with our merger with newkirk  vornado realty trust  which we refer to as vornado  was granted a limited exemption from the definition of interested shareholder 
maryland control share acquisition act 
maryland law provides that control shares of a maryland reit acquired in a control share acquisition shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two thirds of the vote entitled to be cast on the matter under the maryland control share acquisition act 
shares owned by the acquiror  by our officers or by employees who are our trustees are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter 
control shares means shares that  if aggregated with all other shares previously acquired by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy  would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing trustees within one of the following ranges of voting power one tenth or more but less than one third  one third or more but less than a majority or a majority or more of all voting power 
control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained shareholder approval 
a control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares  subject to certain exceptions 
if voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a shareholders meeting  then subject to certain conditions and limitations the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value 
if voting rights of such control shares are approved at a shareholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote  all other shareholders may exercise appraisal rights 
any control shares acquired in a control share acquisition which are not exempt under our by laws will be subject to the maryland control share acquisition act 
our amended and restated by laws contain a provision exempting from the maryland control share acquisition act any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares 
we cannot assure you that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 
limits on ownership of our capital shares may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us 
for us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  among other requirements  not more than of the value of our outstanding capital shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes to include certain entities during the last half of each taxable year  and these capital shares must be beneficially owned by or more persons during at least days of a taxable year of months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year in each case  other than the first such year for which a reit election is made 
our amended and restated declaration of trust includes certain restrictions regarding transfers of our capital shares and ownership limits 
actual or constructive ownership of our capital shares in excess of the share ownership limits contained in its declaration of trust would cause the violative transfer or ownership to be void or cause the shares to be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to a person or entity who can own the shares without violating these limits 
as a result  if a violative transfer were made  the recipient of the shares would not acquire any economic or voting rights attributable to the transferred shares 
additionally  the constructive ownership rules for these limits are complex and groups of related individuals or entities may be deemed a single owner and consequently in violation of the share ownership limits 
these restrictions and limits may not be adequate in all cases  however  to prevent the transfer of our capital shares in violation of the ownership limitations 
the ownership limits discussed above may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us  even though a change of control could involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in shareholders best interests 
legislative or regulatory tax changes could have an adverse effect on us 
at any time  the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended 
any of those new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect us or you as a shareholder 
reit dividends generally are not eligible for the reduced rates currently applicable to certain corporate dividends unless attributable to dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and otherwise eligible for such rates 
as a result  investment in non reit corporations may be relatively more attractive than investment in reits 
this could adversely affect the market price of our shares 
our board of trustees may change our investment policy without shareholders approval 
subject to our fundamental investment policy to maintain our qualification as a reit  our board of trustees will determine its investment and financing policies  growth strategy and its debt  capitalization  distribution  acquisition  disposition and operating policies 
our board of trustees may revise or amend these strategies and policies at any time without a vote by shareholders 
accordingly  shareholders control over changes in our strategies and policies is limited to the election of trustees  and changes made by our board of trustees may not serve the interests of shareholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations  including our ability to distribute cash to shareholders or qualify as a reit 
our inability to carry out our growth strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our growth strategy is based on the acquisition and development of additional properties and related assets  including acquisitions of large portfolios and real estate companies and acquisitions through co investment programs such as joint ventures 
in the context of our business plan  development generally means an expansion or renovation of an existing property or the acquisition of a newly constructed property 
we may provide a developer with a commitment to acquire a property upon completion of construction of a property and commencement of rent from the tenant 
our plan to grow through the acquisition and development of new properties could be adversely affected by trends in the real estate and financing businesses 
the consummation of any future acquisitions will be subject to satisfactory completion of an extensive valuation analysis and due diligence review and to the negotiation of definitive documentation 
our ability to implement our strategy may be impeded because we may have difficulty finding new properties and investments at attractive prices that meet our investment criteria  negotiating with new or existing tenants or securing acceptable financing 
if we are unable to carry out our strategy  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
acquisitions of additional properties entail the risk that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations  including operating and leasing expectations 
redevelopment and new project development are subject to numerous risks  including risks of construction delays  cost overruns or force majeure events that may increase project costs  new project commencement risks such as the receipt of zoning  occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits  and the incurrence of development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion 
some of our acquisitions and developments may be financed using the proceeds of periodic equity or debt offerings  lines of credit or other forms of secured or unsecured financing that may result in a risk that permanent financing for newly acquired projects might not be available or would be available only on disadvantageous terms 
if permanent debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms to refinance acquisitions undertaken without permanent financing  further acquisitions may be curtailed or cash available for distribution to shareholders may be adversely affected 
the concentration of ownership by certain investors may limit other shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions 
at december   vornado beneficially owned million common shares and e 
robert roskind  our chairman  beneficially owned million of our common shares and million units of limited partner interest in our operating partnerships  which are redeemable for our common shares on a one for one basis  or with respect to a portion of the units  at our election  cash 
each of vornado and mr 
roskind may have substantial influence over us and on the outcome of any matters submitted to our shareholders for approval 
in addition  certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest between each of vornado and mr 
roskind and our other equity or debt holders 
in addition  vornado engages in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business and may engage in activities that result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us  such as competition for properties and tenants 
securities eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price 
an aggregate of approximately million of our common shares are issuable upon the exercise of employee share options and the exchange of units of limited partnership interests in our operating partnership subsidiaries 
depending upon the number of such securities exercised or exchanged at one time  an exercise or exchange of such securities could be dilutive to or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of our common shares 
we are dependent upon our key personnel 
we are dependent upon key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
we are dependent on our executive officers for business direction 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain employees  including e 
robert roskind  our chairman  richard j 
rouse  our vice chairman and chief investment officer  t 
wilson eglin  our chief executive officer  president and chief operating officer  and patrick carroll  our executive vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer 
our inability to retain the services of any of our key personnel or our loss of any of their services could adversely impact our operations 
we do not have key man life insurance coverage on our executive officers 
risks specific to our investment in concord in addition to the risks described above  our investment in concord is subject to the following additional risks concord engages in hedging transactions that may limit gains or result in losses 
concord uses derivatives to hedge its liabilities and this has certain risks  including losses on a hedge position  which have in the past and may in the future reduce the return on our investment in concord and such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
in addition  counterparties to a hedging arrangement could default on their obligations 
concord may have to pay certain costs  such as transaction fees or brokerage costs related to its hedging transactions 
the loans concord invests in are subject to delinquency  foreclosure and loss 
concord s commercial real estate loans and loan securities are directly and indirectly secured by income producing property 
these loans are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure as well as risk associated with the capital markets 
the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower 
if a borrower were to default on a loan  it is possible that concord would not recover the full value of the loan 
the subordinate loan assets concord invests in may be subject to risks relating to the structure and terms of the transactions  and there may not be sufficient funds or assets remaining to satisfy our subordinate notes  which may result in losses to concord 
concord invests in loan assets that are subordinate in payment and collateral to more senior loans 
if a borrower defaults or declares bankruptcy  after the more senior obligations are satisfied  there may not be sufficient funds or assets remaining to satisfy concord s subordinate notes 
because each transaction is privately negotiated  subordinate loan assets can vary in their structural characteristics and lender rights including concord s rights to control the default or bankruptcy process varies from transaction to transaction 
the subordinate loan assets that concord invests in may not give concord the right to demand foreclosure as a subordinate debtholder 
furthermore  the presence of intercreditor agreements may limit concord s ability to amend the loan documents  assign the loans  accept prepayments  exercise remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers 
bankruptcy and borrower litigation can significantly increase the time needed for concord to acquire possession of underlying collateral in the event of a default  during which time the collateral may decline in value 
in addition  there are significant costs and delays associated with the foreclosure process 
concord invests in subordinate mortgage backed securities which are subject to a greater risk of loss than senior securities 
concord may hold the most junior class of mortgage backed securities which are subject to the first risk of loss if any losses are realized on the underlying mortgage loans 
concord invests in a variety of subordinate loan securities  and sometimes hold a first loss subordinate holder position 
the ability of a borrower to make payments on the loan underlying these securities is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of the property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower since the underlying loans are generally non recourse in nature 
in the event of default and the exhaustion of any equity support  reserve funds  letters of credit and any classes of securities junior to those in which concord invests  concord will not be able to recover all of its investment in the securities purchased 
the widening of credit spreads has had and will continue to have a negative impact on the value of concord s assets 
although concord acquired its loan assets and loan securities with the intent to hold them to maturity  the value of concord s loan assets and loan securities is dependent upon the yield demanded on these assets by the market based on the underlying credit 
a large supply of these loan securities combined with reduced demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on these loan securities  resulting in a higher  or wider  spread over the benchmark rate of such loan securities 
under these conditions such as those that we are currently experiencing  the value of loan securities in concord s portfolio has and will tend to decline 
such changes in the market value of concord s portfolio has and will adversely affect concord s net equity through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on available for sale loan securities  and therefore concord s cash flow since concord would be unable to realize gains through sale of such loan securities 
also  they have and could continue to adversely affect concord s ability to borrow and access capital 
concord prices its assets based on its assumptions about future credit spreads for financing of those assets 
concord has obtained in the past longer term financing for its assets using structured financing techniques such as collateralized debt obligations cdos 
such issuances entail interest rates set at a spread over a certain benchmark  such as the yield on united states treasury obligations  swaps or libor 
if the spread that investors are paying on structured finance vehicles over the benchmark widens and the rates concord charges on its securitized assets are not increased accordingly  this may reduce concord s income or cause losses 
the deterioration of the credit markets has had an adverse impact on the ability of concord s borrowers to obtain replacement financing 
the deterioration of credit markets has made it extremely difficult for borrowers to obtain mortgage financing 
the inability of concord s borrowers to obtain replacement financing has led and will likely continue to lead to more loan defaults thereby resulting in expensive and time consuming foreclosure actions and or negotiated extensions to existing loans beyond their current expirations on terms which may not be as favorable to concord as the existing loans 
the repurchase agreements that concord uses to finance its investments may require it to provide additional collateral 
if the market value of the loan assets and loan securities pledged or sold by concord to repurchase counterparties decline in value  which decline is determined  in most cases  by the repurchase counterparties  concord may be required by the repurchase counterparties to provide additional collateral or pay down a portion of the funds advanced 
posting additional collateral to support its repurchase facilities will reduce concord s return on assets and liquidity as well as limit its ability to leverage its assets 
if concord cannot post additional collateral  concord will be required to satisfy the margin calls in cash 
accordingly  if concord is required to use its cash  or if it does not have sufficient cash  to meet such requirements  it will result in a rapid deterioration of concord s financial condition and solvency as well as the loss of assets to the repurchase counterparties  thereby adversely affecting our investment in concord 
the credit and capital market deterioration has significantly strained concord s liquidity 
the inability of concord to obtain replacement financing coupled with pending maturities and margin calls on its repurchase obligations has significantly strained concord s liquidity as cash from operations is required to be used primarily to satisfy repayments under repurchase agreements and margin calls 
until there is a recovery in the credit and capital markets and depending on the length of the extent of margin calls and loan defaults  concord will likely have to utilize its cash flow to meet regular debt service payments as well as margin calls on its repurchase facilities and preferred distribution payments thereby reducing distributions to members 
in addition  if alternative financing is not available or the level of defaults on concord s loan assets and loan securities increases  concord may not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its debt obligations which may require concord to liquidate assets at unfavorable pricing 
credit ratings assigned to concord s investments are subject to ongoing evaluations and we cannot be sure that the ratings currently assigned to concord s investments will not be downgraded 
some of concord s investments are rated by the major rating agencies 
the credit ratings on these investments are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies 
if rating agencies assign a lower rating or reduce  or indicate that they may reduce  their ratings of concord s investments  the market value of those investments could significantly decline  which could have an adverse affect on concord s financial condition 
the coverage tests in concord s existing cdo may have a negative impact on concord s operating results and cash flows 
concord s current cdo contains coverage tests  including over collateralization tests  which are used primarily to determine whether and to what extent principal and interest proceeds on the underlying collateral debt securities and other assets may be used to pay principal and interest on the subordinate classes of bonds in the cdo 
in the event the coverage tests are not met  distributions otherwise payable to concord may be re directed to pay principal on the bond classes senior to concord s 
therefore  concord s failure to satisfy the coverage tests could adversely affect concord s operating results and cash flows 
certain coverage tests which may be applicable to concord s interest in its cdos based on delinquency levels or other criteria may also restrict concord s ability to receive net income from assets pledged to secure the cdo 
if concord s assets fail to perform as anticipated  concord s over collateralization or other credit enhancement expense associated with its cdos will increase

lexington streetsboro llc v 
alfred geis  et al 
beginning in january  on behalf of one of our co investment programs  we received notices from the tenant in our streetsboro  ohio facility regarding certain alleged deficiencies in the construction of the facility as compared to the original building specifications 
upon acquisition of the facility from the developer  the then owner of the facility obtained an indemnity from the principals of the developer covering a breach of construction warranties  the construction and or the condition of the premises 
after two years of correspondence among the owner of the facility  the developer and the tenant  we after our acquisition of the facility from our co investment program entered into an amendment to the lease with the tenant providing for the repair of a portion of the alleged deficiencies and commenced such repairs beginning in the summer of following a demand for reimbursement under the indemnity agreement  we filed suit against the developer and the principals of the developer in the federal district court for the northern district of ohio on august  for breach of the indemnity agreement  declaratory judgment  unjust enrichment  breach of contract and negligent design lexington streestboro llc v 
alfred geis  et al  case no 
cv 
on november   the developer filed counter claims against us for unjust enrichment regarding the repair work performed and for a declaration of its obligations under the indemnity agreement and multiple cross claims against its sub contractors asking to be reimbursed for any deficiencies in the building specifications for which they are held liable 
the developer was also permitted by the court to file a claim against the tenant 
the claim against the tenant was withdrawn after a settlement of a portion of our claim against the developer 
as of december   we have incurred million of costs in connection with repair and other work at the facility 
in august and october  we participated in a court ordered mediation  which did not result in a final settlement 
the suit is ongoing and trial is scheduled for october we have reached a preliminary agreement to settle all claims for a million cash payment to us 
the agreement is being documented and it is expected that we will execute a settlement agreement within the next days 
we can give no assurance that we will receive the million cash payment or enter into the settlement agreement

under the terms of the agreements covering the sale of the claims  we are obligated to reimburse deutsche bank should the claim ever be disallowed  subordinated or otherwise impaired  to the extent of such disallowance  subordination or impairment  plus interest at the rate of per annum from the date of payment of the purchase price by deutsche bank to us 
on october   dana corporation filed an objection to both claims 
we assisted deutsche bank and the then holders of the claims in the preparation and filing of a response to the objection 
despite a belief by us that the objections were without merit  the holders of the claims  without our consent  settled the allowed amount of the claims at million for the farmington hills claim and million for the antioch claim 
deutsche bank made a formal demand with respect to the farmington hills claim in the amount of million plus interest  but did not make a formal demand with respect to the antioch claim 
following a rejection of the demand  deutsche bank and spcp group  llc filed a summons and complaint with the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york for the farmington hills and antioch claims  and claimed damages of million plus interest and expenses 
we answered the complaint on november  and served numerous discovery requests 
we intend to continue to vigorously defend the claims for a variety of reasons  including that the holders of the claims arbitrarily settled the claims for reasons based on factors other than the merits and the holders of the claims voluntarily reduced the claims to participate in certain settlement pools

table of contents page overview liquidity capital resources results of operations off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations overview general 
we are a self managed and self administered real estate investment trust formed under the laws of the state of maryland 
we operate primarily in one segment and our primary business is the investment in and the acquisition  ownership and management of a geographically diverse portfolio of net leased office  industrial and retail properties 
substantially all of our properties are subject to triple net leases  which are generally characterized as leases in which the tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs and or cost increases for real estate taxes  utilities  insurance and ordinary repairs 
as of december   we had ownership interests in approximately consolidated real estate assets  located in states and the netherlands and encompassing approximately million square feet 
we lease our properties to tenants in various industries  including finance insurance  automotive  aerospace defense  energy and technology 
our revenues and cash flows are generated predominantly from property rent receipts 
as a result  growth in revenues and cash flows is directly correlated to our ability to acquire income producing real estate assets  to re lease properties that are vacant  or may become vacant at favorable rental rates and earn fee income 
global credit and financial crisis 
the current global credit and financial crisis intensified near the end of the quarter ended september  and continues with such intensity today 
the crisis has impacted our business in a number of ways  including a significant decrease in property acquisitions  tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and difficulty obtaining financing 
the specific impacts and expected impacts of the crisis are discussed in detail below 
acquisition objectives 
acquiring income producing real estate assets is one of our primary focuses 
the challenge we face is finding investments that will provide an attractive return without compromising our real estate underwriting criteria 
while we believe we have access to acquisition opportunities due to our relationship with developers  brokers  corporate users and sellers  our acquisition activity decreased during the last few years as a result of market conditions 
as capitalization rates on investment opportunities began to compress at the end of  we began to decrease our acquisition activity 
following the newkirk merger  our real estate acquisition activity consisted primarily of acquiring the interests that we did not already own in certain of our co investment programs 
in response to the compression in capitalization rates  we refocused our efforts into repurchasing our senior debt at what we believe are attractive and secure yields to maturity and disposing of real estate assets in compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements 
we believe we have benefited from this refocusing during the global credit and financial crisis 
despite the global credit and financial crisis  we continue to review single acquisitions and strategic transactions including forming new co investment programs and joint ventures 
capitalization rates have begun to decompress  however  the difficulty has been obtaining attractive financing during the crisis 
we believe we are prepared to take advantage of opportunities when the financing markets rebound 
when we do acquire real estate assets  we look for general purpose office and industrial real estate assets subject to a long term net lease which have one or more of the following characteristics a credit worthy tenant  adaptability to a variety of users  including multi tenant use  and an attractive geographic location 
during  we purchased two properties from unrelated parties  for an aggregate capitalized cost of million 
capital recycling 
during  we continued to dispose of non core and core assets  subject to regulatory and contractual requirements  in order to increase liquidity 
we were  and believe we still are  able to dispose of these assets at prices that allow us to realize an attractive internal rate of return 
during  we sold properties to unrelated third parties for an aggregate sales price of million  disposed of one property through foreclosure  contributed sold properties to nls with an agreed upon value of million and sold our interest in wells for per share 
we primarily used the proceeds to repurchase senior debt and preferred securities at what we believe are favorable spreads 
we believe this capital recycling provides us with enhanced return rates while allowing us to deleverage 
during  we retired a total of million of exchangeable guaranteed notes and trust preferred securities at a discounted cost to us of approximately million  which we funded with million in cash and through the issuance of million common shares  at an average price of approximately per share and an aggregate value at issuance of million 
leasing objectives 
re leasing properties as leases expire and properties currently vacant at favorable effective rates is one of our primary focuses 
the primary risks associated with re tenanting properties are the period of time required to find a new tenant  whether rental rates will be lower than previously received  the significant leasing costs such as commissions and tenant improvement allowances and the payment of operating costs such as real estate taxes and insurance while there is no offsetting revenue 
we try to mitigate these risks by contacting tenants well in advance of lease maturity to get an understanding of their occupancy needs  contacting local brokers to determine the depth of the rental market and retaining local expertise to assist in the re tenanting of a property 
however  no assurance can be given that once a property becomes vacant it will subsequently be re let 
we continue to monitor the credit of our tenants and are particularly focused on our tenants in the financial  retail and automotive industries 
during the year ended december   certain of our tenants filed for bankruptcy  including linens n things  inc  which we refer to as linens  circuit city stores  inc  which we refer to as circuit city  and bally s total fitness of the midwest  which we refer to as bally s 
under current bankruptcy law  a tenant can generally assume or reject a lease within a certain number of days of filing its bankruptcy petition 
if a tenant rejects the lease  our damages are generally limited to the greater of one year s rent and the rent for  not to exceed three years  of the remaining term of the lease 
linens was the tenant at our  square foot distribution warehouse facility located in swedesboro  new jersey 
linens rejected its lease for our facility and vacated the facility on december  the lease provided for annual rental revenue of million and was scheduled to expire on december  the facility is subject to non recourse first mortgage financing with a principal amount of million as of december  and a fixed interest rate of 
we are seeking recovery of our damages  however  we do not anticipate recovering the entire amount 
circuit city is currently the tenant in our  square foot office building located in richmond  virginia  which is part of its headquarter campus 
on january   circuit city announced that it has begun the process to liquidate its assets 
circuit city rejected its lease for our facility 
we expect circuit city to vacate the premises by the end of the first quarter of the lease provides for annual rental revenue of million and expires on february  we are seeking recovery of our damages  however  we do not anticipate recovering the entire amount 
bally s is currently the tenant in our  square foot health club facility located in canton  ohio 
as of the date of this annual report  bally s has yet to assume or reject the lease 
the lease provides for annual rental revenue of million and expires on december  in addition  we hold a mortgage note of approximately million at december   which is secured by a facility leased to bally s in vorhees  new jersey 
the borrower is current in its obligations under the mortgage note 
we own consolidated properties totaling approximately million square feet with aggregate rental revenues of approximately million that are leased to tenants in the automotive industry 
the primary business of these tenants is supply  manufacturing and installation 
we are closely monitoring the automotive industry in general and our tenants within that industry 
if a property cannot be re let to a single user and the property can be adapted to multi tenant use  we determine whether the costs of adapting the property to multi tenant use outweigh the benefit of funding operating costs while searching for a single tenant 
during  two properties were converted to multi tenant use following expiration of a lease with a single tenant user 
certain of the long term leases on our properties contain provisions that may mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled fixed base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  a majority of the leases on our properties require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses 
in addition  the leases on our properties are generally structured in a way that minimizes our responsibility for capital improvements 
critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards 
our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require our management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
a summary of our significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards which are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this annual report and incorporated herein 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies  which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting 
the financial statements reflect our accounts and the accounts of our consolidated subsidiaries 
we determine whether an entity for which we hold an interest should be consolidated pursuant to financial accounting standards board  which we refer to as fasb  interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities  which we refer to as fin r  and or emerging issues task force  which we refer to as eitf   determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  which we refer to as eitf fin r requires us to evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights 
if the entity is not a variable interest entity we apply the guidance in eitf  and if we control the entity s voting shares or similar rights as determined in eitf  the entity is consolidated 
use of estimates 
our management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our management s best estimates and judgment 
our management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment 
the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions 
our management adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate 
the most significant estimates made include the recoverability of accounts receivable  allocation of property purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  the determination of impairment of long lived assets and equity method investments  valuation and impairment of assets held by equity method investees  valuation of derivative financial instruments  and the useful lives of long lived assets 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
business combinations 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  which we refer to as sfas  no 
 business combinations  which we refer to as sfas  and record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value 
on december   we acquired newkirk  which was a variable interest entity vie 
we follow the provisions of fin r  and as a result have recorded the minority interest in newkirk at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition 
the value of the consideration issued in common shares is based upon a reasonable period before and after the date that the terms of the newkirk merger were agreed to and announced 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which we refer to as sfas r 
sfas r requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition 
sfas r expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
sfas r is effective for acquisitions in periods beginning on or after december  the adoption of this standard could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate  as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
the fair value of the real estate acquired  which includes the impact of fair value adjustments for assumed mortgage debt related to property acquisitions  is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  building and improvements and fixtures and equipment is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  building and improvements based on our management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
factors considered by our management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  our management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
our management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market lease values are recorded based on the difference between the current in place lease rent and management s estimate of current market rents 
below market lease intangibles are recorded as part of deferred revenue and amortized into rental revenue over the non cancelable periods and bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
above market leases are recorded as part of intangible assets and amortized as a direct charge against rental revenue over the non cancelable portion of the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and customer relationships  is measured by the excess of the purchase price paid for a property over the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and customer relationships based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
the value of in place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods and any bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
customer relationships are amortized to expense over the applicable lease term plus expected renewal periods 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases  as amended  which we refer to as sfas sfas requires that revenue be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property 
renewal options in leases with rental terms that are lower than those in the primary term are excluded from the calculation of straight line rent if the renewals are not reasonably assured 
in those instances in which we fund tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by us  revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant 
when we determine that the tenant allowances are lease incentives  we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin 
the lease incentive is recorded as a deferred expense and amortized as a reduction of revenue on a straight line basis over the respective lease term 
we recognize lease termination payments as a component of rental revenue in the period received  provided that there are no further obligations under the lease 
all above market lease assets  below market lease liabilities and deferred rent assets or liabilities for terminated leases are charged against or credited to rental revenue in the period the lease is terminated 
all other capitalized lease costs and lease intangibles are accelerated via amortization expense to the date of termination 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate  as amended  which we refer to as sfas the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  the gain is deferred and the finance  installment or cost recovery method  as appropriate  is applied until the sales criteria are met 
to the extent we sell a property and retain a partial ownership interest in the property  we recognize gain to the extent of the third party ownership interest in accordance with sfas accounts receivable 
we continuously monitor collections from our tenants and would make a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and any specific tenant collection issues that we have identified 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was not significant 
impairment of real estate 
we evaluate the carrying value of all tangible and intangible assets held when a triggering event under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as amended  which we refer to as sfas  has occurred to determine if an impairment has occurred which would require the recognition of a loss 
the evaluation includes estimating and reviewing anticipated future cash flows to be derived from the asset 
however  estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results depreciation is determined by the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic useful lives of the properties 
we generally depreciate buildings and building improvements over periods ranging from to years  land improvements from to years  and fixtures and equipment from to years 
only costs incurred to third parties in acquiring properties are capitalized 
no internal costs rents  salaries  overhead are capitalized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations which extend the useful life of the properties are capitalized 
impairment of equity method investments 
we assess whether there are indicators that the value of our equity method investments may be impaired 
an investment s value is impaired if we determine that a decline in the value of the investment below its carrying value is other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated value of the investment 
properties held for sale 
we account for properties held for sale in accordance with sfas sfas requires that the assets and liabilities of properties that meet various criteria in sfas be presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets  with assets and liabilities being separately stated 
the operating results of these properties are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
properties that do not meet the held for sale criteria of sfas are accounted for as operating properties 
investments in non consolidated entities 
we account for our investments in or less owned entities under the equity method  unless pursuant to fin r consolidation is required or if our investment in the entity is less than and we have no influence over the control of the entity then the entity is accounted for under the cost method 
marketable equity securities 
we classify our existing marketable equity securities as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities are carried at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses  including our proportionate share of the unrealized gains or losses from non consolidated entities  reported in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains or losses on securities sold and other than temporary impairments are included in our consolidated statement of operations 
sales of securities are recorded on the trade date and gains and losses are generally determined by the specific identification method 
investments in debt securities 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity  reported at amortized cost and are included with other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
a decline in the market value of any held to maturity security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in an impairment and would reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end  forecasted performance of the investee  and the general market condition in the geographic area or industry the investee operates in 
notes receivable 
we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal of each of our notes  if circumstances warrant  to determine whether it is impaired 
a note is considered to be impaired  when based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a note is considered to be impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the note s effective interest rate 
interest on impaired notes is recognized on a cash basis 
deferred expenses 
deferred expenses consist primarily of debt and leasing costs 
debt costs are amortized using the straight line method  which approximates the interest method  over the terms of the debt instruments and leasing costs are amortized over the term of the related lease 
derivative financial instruments 
we account for our interest rate swap agreements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  which we refer to as sfas in accordance with sfas  these agreements are carried on the balance sheet at their fair value  as an asset  if their fair value is positive  or as a liability  if their fair value is negative 
if the interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the swap s change in fair value is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion  if any  is recognized in earnings as an increase or decrease to interest expense 
upon entering into hedging transactions  we document the relationship between the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged liability 
we also document our risk management policies  including objectives and strategies  as they relate to our hedging activities 
we assess  both at inception of a hedge and on an on going basis  whether or not the hedge is highly effective  as defined by sfas we will discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis with changes in the estimated fair value reflected in earnings when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows of a hedge item including forecasted transactions  it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  or it is determined that designating the derivative as an interest rate swap is no longer appropriate 
we may utilize interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage interest rate risk and do not anticipate entering into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes 
stock compensation 
we maintain an equity participation plan 
options granted under the plan in vest upon attainment of certain market performance measures and expire ten years from the date of grant 
non vest share grants generally vest either based upon i time ii performance and or iii market conditions 
prior to january   we accounted for the plan under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board  which we refer to as apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations including fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 

effective january   we adopted the prospective method provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which we refer to as sfas no 
 which applies the recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which we refer to as sfas no 
 to all employee awards granted  modified or settled after january  during december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which we refer to as sfas no 
r  and which is a revision of statement sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in statement however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we began expensing stock based employee compensation with our adoption of the prospective method provisions of sfas no 
 effective january   as a result  the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
tax matters 
we have made an election to qualify  and believes we are operating so as to qualify  as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax  provided that distributions to our shareholders equal at least the amount of our reit taxable income as defined under sections through of the code 
we are permitted to participate in certain activities from which we were previously precluded in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries under the code 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we refer to as fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which we refer to as sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
fair value measurements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  as amended  which we refer to as sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas were effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years  except for those relating to non financial assets and liabilities  which were deferred for one additional year  and a scope exception for purposes of fair value measurements affecting lease classification or measurement under sfas no 
and related standards 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities  level observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets  but corroborated by market data  and level unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level inputs and the lowest priority to level inputs 
in determining fair value  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value 
the adoption of the effective portions of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the implementation of this statement as it relates to non financial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  which we refer to as fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of fasb  fair value measurements  in a market that is not active 
among other things  fsp fas clarifies that determination of fair value in a dislocated market depends on facts and circumstances and may require the use of significant judgment about whether individual transactions are forced liquidations or distressed sales 
in cases where the volume and level of trading activity for an asset have declined significantly  the available prices vary significantly over time or among market participants  or the prices are not current  observable inputs might not be relevant and could require significant adjustment 
in addition  fsp fas also clarifies that broker or pricing service quotes may be appropriate inputs when measuring fair value  but are not necessarily determinative if an active market does not exist for the financial asset 
regardless of the valuation techniques used  fsp fas requires that an entity include appropriate risk adjustments that market participants would make for nonperformance and liquidity risks 
fsp fas was effective upon issuance and includes prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
we have adopted fsp fas  which did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas no  which we refer to as sfas sfas  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information about how and why a company uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
 and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the required disclosures include the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format  information about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements  counterparty  credit risk  and the company s strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments 
sfas is effective prospectively for periods beginning on or after november  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the following recently issued accounting standard is effective for fiscal years after december  and requires retroactive application 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  which we refer to as fsp fsp is applicable to issuers of convertible debt that may be settled wholly or partly in cash 
the adoption of fsp will affect the accounting for our exchangeable guaranteed notes issued in fsp requires the initial proceeds from the sale of the exchangeable guaranteed notes to be allocated between a liability component representing debt and an equity component representing the conversion feature 
the resulting discount will be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense 
fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and requires retroactive application 
the adoption of fsp will result in recognition of an aggregate unamortized debt discount of approximately million and approximately million as of december  and  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheets and additional interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the years then ended 
the current estimate of the incremental interest expense and debt satisfaction gain reduction  net of minority interest  for each reporting period is as follows s for the year ended december interest expense debt satisfaction gain reduction the accounting for these critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters 
accordingly  future reported financial conditions and results could differ materially from financial conditions and results reported based on management s current estimates 
liquidity general 
since becoming a public company  our principal sources of liquidity have been undistributed cash flows generated from our investments  the public and private equity and debt markets  including issuances of op units property specific debt  corporate level borrowings  and commitments from co investment partners 
our ability to incur additional debt to fund acquisitions is dependent upon our existing leverage  the value of the assets we are attempting to leverage and general economic and credit market conditions  which may be outside of management s control or influence 
cash flows 
we believe that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility  issuance of equity and debt and co investment programs as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required by us 
cash flows from operations as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows totaled million for  million for and million for the underlying drivers that impact working capital and therefore cash flows from operations are the timing of collection of rents  including reimbursements from tenants  the collection of advisory fees  payment of interest on mortgage debt and payment of operating and general and administrative costs 
we believe the net lease structure of the majority of our tenants leases enhances cash flows from operations since the payment and timing of operating costs related to the properties are generally borne directly by the tenant 
collection and timing of tenant rents is closely monitored by management as part of our cash management program 
net cash provided by used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by investing activities related primarily to collection of notes receivable  distributions from non consolidated entities in excess of accumulated earnings  proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities and proceeds from the sale of properties 
cash used in investing activities related primarily to investments in real estate properties  co investment programs  notes receivable  an increase in deferred leasing costs and the purchase of minority interests 
therefore  the fluctuation in investing activities relates primarily to the timing of investments and dispositions 
net cash used in provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities during each year was primarily attributable to proceeds from equity offerings  non recourse mortgages and borrowings under our credit facility offset by dividend and distribution payments and debt payments and repurchases 
public and private equity and debt markets 
we access the public and private equity and debt markets when we believe conditions are favorable and we have a compelling use of proceeds 
during  we issued approximately million common shares raising net proceeds of approximately million 
we primarily used these proceeds to retire indebtedness 
in february  we completed an offering of million series d preferred shares  having a liquidation amount of per share and an annual dividend rate of  raising net proceeds of million 
during  we issued  through a wholly owned subsidiary  million in trust preferred securities  which bear interest at a fixed rate of through april and thereafter at a variable rate of three month libor plus basis points through maturity 
these securities are classified as debt  due in  and redeemable by us commencing april during  we repurchased  through unsolicited offers  million of these securities for million in cash  which resulted in a gain on debt extinguishment of million including a write off of million in deferred financing costs 
during  we issued an aggregate million of exchangeable guaranteed notes due in these notes can be put to us commencing in and every five years thereafter through maturity 
the notes are exchangeable by the holders into common shares at a current price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events  including increases in our dividend rate above a certain threshold 
upon exchange  the holders of the notes would receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and to the extent the exchange value exceeds the principal amount of the note  either cash or common shares at our option 
during  we repurchased million original principal amount of the notes for million in cash and million common shares having a value at issuance of million or per share  which resulted in gains on debt extinguishment of million  including write offs of million in deferred financing costs 
during  we repurchased million common shares at an average price of per share and repurchased and retired  of our series c preferred shares by issuing million common shares and paying million in cash 
the difference between the cost to retire these series c preferred shares and their historical cost was million and is treated as an increase to shareholders equity and as a reduction in preferred dividends paid for calculating earnings per share 
we also entered into a forward equity commitment to purchase million of our common shares at a price of per share  we have prepaid in cash million of the million purchase price as of december   agreed to make floating payments during the term of the forward purchase at libor plus basis points per annum and we retain the dividends paid on the million common shares 
current market conditions are not favorable for accessing the public and private equity and debt markets 
once market conditions improve  we intend to access the public and private equity markets to further our deleveraging efforts 
upreit structure 
our upreit structure permits us to effect acquisitions by issuing to a property owner  as a form of consideration in exchange for the property  op units in our operating partnerships 
substantially all outstanding op units are redeemable by the holder at certain times for common shares on a one for one basis or  at our election  with respect to certain op units  cash 
substantially all outstanding op units require us to pay quarterly distributions to the holders of such op units equal to the dividends paid to our common shareholders and the remaining op units have stated distributions in accordance with their respective partnership agreement 
to the extent that our dividend per share is less than a stated distribution per unit per the applicable partnership agreement  the stated distributions per unit are reduced by the percentage reduction in our dividend 
no op units have a liquidation preference 
we account for outstanding op units in a manner similar to a minority interest holder 
the number of common shares that will be outstanding in the future should be expected to increase  and minority interest expense should be expected to decrease  as such op units are redeemed for our common shares 
on december   the mlp merged with and into us and million op units were exchanged into an equal number of common shares 
as of december   there were million op units outstanding 
of the total op units outstanding  approximately million are held by related parties 
property specific debt 
we expect to continue to use property specific  non recourse mortgages as we believe that by properly matching a debt obligation  including the balloon maturity risk  with a lease expiration  our cash on cash returns increase and the exposure to residual valuation risk is reduced 
however  the global credit and financial crisis has impacted our ability to obtain property specific debt on favorable terms 
during  we obtained or assumed million in property specific non recourse mortgage financings on two properties  which have a fixed weighted average interest rate of 
the proceeds of the financing not assumed were used to retire existing indebtedness 
during  we informed the lender for the mortgage secured by our property in auburn hills  michigan that we would no longer make debt service payments and our intention to convey the property to the lender 
following discussion with the lender  the lender foreclosed on this property on december   and on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with the lender and we were released from obligations under the mortgage 
corporate borrowings 
we use corporate level borrowings  such as our unsecured revolving credit facility and secured term loans  to finance our investments and operations 
our million unsecured revolving credit facility with wachovia bank na and a consortium of other banks  was scheduled to expire june and bore interest at basis points over libor depending on our leverage as defined in the credit facility 
the credit facility contained financial covenants including restrictions on the level of indebtedness  amount of variable debt to be borrowed and net worth maintenance provisions 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants  million of borrowings were outstanding  million was available to be borrowed  and million letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility 
upon entering into the new secured credit facility consisting of a term loan and revolving credit facility on february   the million outstanding was satisfied and the credit agreement with wachovia bank na was terminated 
we have three term loans with key bank  as of december  which are secured by pledges of equity interests in subsidiaries that directly own property and guarantees from other subsidiaries 
in june  we obtained a million original principal amount secured term loan from key bank  which bore interest at libor plus basis points 
as of december   million was outstanding under the secured loan 
the secured loan was scheduled to mature in june  with our option to extend to december the secured loan required monthly payments of interest only 
we were also required to make principal payments from the proceeds of certain property sales and certain refinancings if proceeds were not reinvested into net leased properties 
the required principal payments were based on a minimum release price set forth in the secured loan agreement 
we were in compliance with the secured term loan covenants at december  and upon entering into the new secured credit facility on february   this loan was satisfied in full and the term loan was terminated 
in march  we obtained million and million secured term loans from keybank 
the loans are interest only at libor plus basis points  however we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which fixed the interest rate at  and mature in the net proceeds of the loans of million were used to partially repay indebtedness on three cross collateralized mortgages 
after such repayment  the amount owed on the three mortgages was million  the three loans were combined into one loan  which is interest only instead of having a portion as self amortizing and matures in september as of december   million and million was outstanding on each secured term loan and we were in compliance with the covenants contained in each loan 
as of december   the borrowing base for the million and the million original principal amount secured term loans was comprised of properties 
as of december   the borrowing base for the million original principal amount secured term loan was comprised of the three properties secured by the mortgages repaid at origination 
on february   we refinanced our unsecured revolving credit facility  with million outstanding as of december   which was scheduled to expire in june  and secured term loan  with million outstanding as of december   which was scheduled to mature in  with a secured credit facility consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit agreement with keybank  as agent 
the new facility bears interest at over libor and matures in february  but can be extended until february at our option 
the new credit facility is secured by ownership interest pledges and guarantees by certain of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate own interests in a borrowing base consisting of properties 
with the consent of the lenders  we can increase the size of the term loan by million and the revolving loan by million or million in the aggregate  for a total facility size of million by adding properties to the borrowing base 
liquidity needs 
our principal liquidity needs are the contractual obligations set forth under the heading contractual obligations  below  and the payment of dividends to our shareholders and distributions to the holders of op units 
as of december   there were billion of mortgages and notes payable outstanding  exchangeable guaranteed notes and trust preferred securities  including discontinued operations  with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
our ability to make debt service payments depends upon our rental revenues and our ability to refinance the mortgage related thereto  sell the related property  have available amounts under our credit facility or access other capital 
our ability to accomplish such goals will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the real estate industry  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt at the time  our equity in the mortgaged properties  the financial condition and the operating history of the mortgaged properties  the then current tax laws and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
if we are unable to satisfy our contractual obligations with our cash flow from operations  we intend to use borrowings under our secured credit facility and proceeds from issuances of equity or debt securities 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the code  commencing with our taxable year ended december  if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to shareholders 
in connection with our intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we expect to continue paying regular dividends to our shareholders 
these dividends are expected to be paid from operating cash flows and or from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investments  we generally intend to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio or we may issue common shares in lieu of cash dividends as currently permitted under the code  reserving such amounts as we consider necessary for the maintenance or expansion of properties in our portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as our board of trustees considers appropriate 
we paid approximately million in dividends to our common and preferred shareholders in although we receive the majority of our base rental payments on a monthly basis  we intend to continue paying dividends quarterly 
amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution are invested by us in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
capital resources general 
due to the net lease structure  we historically have not incurred significant expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain our properties 
however  as leases expire  we incur costs in extending the existing tenant leases  re tenanting the properties with a single tenant  or converting the property to multi tenant 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
single tenant properties 
we do not anticipate significant capital expenditures at our properties that are subject to net leases since our tenants at these properties generally bear all or substantially all of the cost of property operations  maintenance and repairs 
at certain single tenant properties that are not subject to a net lease  we have a level of property operating expense responsibility 
multi tenant properties 
primarily as a result of non renewals at single tenant net lease properties  we have multi tenant properties in our consolidated portfolio 
while tenants are generally responsible for increases over base year expenses  we are responsible for the base expenses and capital expenditures at the properties 
our property in baltimore  maryland was previously net leased to st 
paul fire and marine insurance company 
in april  we entered into a lease termination with st 
paul fire and marine insurance company  and we assumed the direct subleases for the property 
on september   the lease with the largest subtenant  legg mason  expires and we expect the building to be approximately leased 
we will need to redevelop the property to assist with our leasing effort 
we expect to upgrade the exterior fa ade of the building and redesign the lobby and outside plaza 
we estimate these improvements will cost approximately million and will be completed over the next several years 
we also own an adjacent parcel and are constructing a parking garage to increase the parking ratio at the property 
vacant properties 
to the extent there is a vacancy in a property  we would be obligated for all operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance 
property expansions 
under certain leases  our tenants have the right to expand the facility located on our property 
in the past we have generally funded  and in the future we intend to generally fund  these property expansions with additional secured borrowings  the repayment of which was funded out of rental increases under the leases covering the expanded properties 
ground leases 
our tenants generally pay the rental obligations on ground leases either directly to the fee holder or to us as increased rent 
however  we are responsible for these payments under certain leases and at vacant properties 
environmental matters 
based upon management s ongoing review of our properties  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties  which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  changes in law  the conduct of tenants  or activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties  will not expose us to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of our tenants  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared with december  changes in our results of operations between these periods are primarily due to a decrease in earnings from non consolidated entities and a decrease in gains on sales of properties  offset by an increase in debt satisfaction gains due to the repurchases of our exchangeable guaranteed notes and trust preferred securities at favorable rates 
of the increase in total gross revenues in of million  million is attributable to an increase in rental revenue  primarily due to million recognized in connection with two lease terminations  and an million increase in tenant reimbursements 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in advisory and incentive fees 
the primary decrease in advisory and incentive fees relates to promoted interests million earned in with respect to two former co investment programs and one advisory agreement 
the decrease in interest and amortization expense of million is due primarily to a decrease in long term debt 
the increase in property operating expense of million is primarily due to an increase in properties for which we have operating expense responsibility  including vacancies and properties with tenant leases subject to expense stops and base year clauses 
the increase in depreciation and amortization of million is due primarily to the growth in real estate and intangibles in through the acquisition of properties from our co investment programs and the acceleration of amortization of certain intangible assets relating to lease terminations in intangible assets are amortized over a shorter period of time generally the lease term than real estate assets 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million is due primarily to a reduction in costs of severance agreements with former officers and merger costs incurred in non operating income increased million due primarily to land received in connection with a lease termination 
debt satisfaction gains charges  net changed million primarily due to gains recognized on the retirement of our exchangeable guaranteed notes and trust preferred securities at a discount in the change in value of forward equity commitment represents the change in value of the prepaid portion of our forward purchase equity contract entered into in the increase in gains on sale of properties affiliates relates to the sale of properties to nls 
minority interests share of income loss changed million due primarily to the merger of the mlp with and into us and the exchange of op units held by limited partners in the mlp for common shares 
the equity in earnings losses of non consolidated entities changed million and is primarily due to a decrease in earnings in our investment in lex win concord of million due to impairment charges and loan loss reserves of million recognized by lex win concord  our share of which was million  losses of million recognized on our investment in nls in  and gains on sale realized of million in relating to the dissolution of one of our former co investment programs 
net income decreased by million primarily due to the net impact of items discussed above offset by a decrease of million in income from discontinued operations

net loss applicable to common shareholders in was million compared to net income applicable to common shareholders in of million 
the decrease is due to the items discussed above plus a reduction in series c preferred share dividends of million and a redemption discount of million due to the repurchase of series c preferred shares offset by an increase of million in series d preferred share dividends 
the increase in net income in future periods will be closely tied to the level of acquisitions made by us 
without acquisitions  the sources of growth in net income are limited to index adjusted rents such as the consumer price index  percentage rents  reduced interest expense on amortizing mortgages and variable rate indebtedness and by controlling other variable overhead costs 
however  there are many factors beyond management s control that could offset these items including  without limitation  increased interest rates and tenant monetary defaults and the other risks described in this annual report 
year ended december  compared with december  changes in our results of operations between these periods are primarily due to the newkirk merger  which was effective december   and the acquisition of the outstanding interests in our co investment programs during the second quarter of of the increase in total gross revenues in of million  million is attributable to rental revenue 
the remaining million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in tenant reimbursements of million and an increase in advisory and incentive fees of million 
the primary increase in advisory and incentive fees relates to promoted interests million earned with respect to two co investment programs and one advisory agreement offset by reduced advisory fees due to the acquisition of the co investment programs in the increase in interest and amortization expense of million is due to the increase in long term debt due to the growth of our portfolio resulting from the newkirk merger and the acquisition of the outstanding interests in our co investment programs

the increase in general and administrative expenses of million is due primarily to costs associated with the newkirk merger million  the costs associated with the formation and dissolution of lexington strategic assets corp  which we refer to as lsac  million  costs incurred in the formation of nls million  and professional fees million all of which is offset by a reduction in other costs including personnel costs million  which relates primarily to the accelerated amortization of non vested common shares in of million and an increase in severance costs in of million 
non operating income increased million due primarily to increased interest and dividends from investments 
debt satisfaction gains charges  net increased million due to mortgages being satisfied at a loss in due to sales of properties to affiliates 
the increase in gains on sale of properties affiliates relates to the sale of properties to nls 
benefit provision for income taxes increased million due to the write off deferred tax assets of lsac  the gain realized due to the sale of properties to nls and earnings of the taxable reit subsidiaries

off balance sheet arrangements general 
as of december   we had investments in various real estate entities with varying structures 
the real estate investments owned by the entities are financed with non recourse debt 
non recourse debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage 
the lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the members of the borrower  except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents 
these exceptions generally relate to limited circumstances including breaches of material representations 
net lease strategic assets fund lp nls is a co investment program with inland nls 
nls was established to acquire single tenant net lease specialty real estate in the united states 
other than the acquisition of properties and a interest in a property from us  nls has not acquired any additional properties 
inland nls and we are currently entitled to a return on of each of our respective investments as follows inland nls  on its common equity  us  on our preferred equity  us  on our common equity  return of our preferred equity  return of inland nls common equity return of our common equity and any remaining cash flow is allocated to inland nls and to us as long as we are the general partner  if not  allocations are to inland nls and to us 
in addition to the initial capital contributions  we and inland nls committed to invest up to an additional million and million  respectively  in nls to acquire additional specialty single tenant net leased assets 
lra has entered into a management agreement with nls whereby lra will receive a management fee of of the equity capital  a property management fee of up to of actual gross revenues from certain assets for which the landlord is obligated to provide property management services contingent upon the recoverability of such fees from the tenant under the applicable lease  and an acquisition fee of of the gross purchase price of each acquired asset by nls 
lex win concord llc 
we and winthrop  have a co investment program  lex win concord  to acquire and originate loans secured  directly and indirectly  by real estate assets through concord 
general following the restructuring of our investment in concord during the third quarter of and provided that certain terms and conditions are satisfied  including payment to inland concord of a priority return  both us and winthrop may elect to reduce our aggregate capital investment in concord to million through distributions of principal payments from the retirement of existing loans and bonds in concord s current portfolio 
in addition  lex win concord is obligated to make additional capital contributions to concord of up to million  of which our proportionate share is million  only if such capital contributions are necessary under certain circumstances 
we expect to only make further capital contributions in lex win concord  if a capital contribution is required under the limited liability company agreement or we believe it is appropriate to our overall investment strategy 
concord s business has been to acquire and originate loan assets and loan securities collateralized by real estate assets including mortgage loans  subordinate interests in whole loans  mezzanine loans  preferred equity and commercial real estate securities including cmbs and cdos 
concord sought to finances its loan assets and loan securities through various structures including repurchase facilities  credit lines  term loans and securitizations and  in this regard  concord formed concord real estate cdo  ltd  which we refer to as cdo  pursuant to which it has financed approximately million of its loan assets and loan securities 
concord has also sought additional capital through sales of preferred equity in concord 
concord s loan assets are intended to be held to maturity and are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  repayments and unfunded commitments unless such loan is deemed to be impaired 
concord s loan securities are treated as available for sale securities and are marked to market on a quarterly basis based on management s assessment 
concord initially sought to produce a stable income stream from its investments in loan assets and loan securities by managing credit risk and interest rate risk 
however  the disruption in the capital and credit markets increased margin calls on concord s repurchase agreements 
furthermore  the ability to issue cdos and the availability of new financing has effectively been eliminated  making the execution of concord s strategy unfeasible at this time 
consequently  concord will focus on the recovery of its equity investments by maximizing the value of its existing assets and toward that end  has worked to increase its liquidity and reduce exposure to maturing debt 
concord began experiencing declines in the fair value of its loan securities in the fourth quarter of consistent with liquidity concerns impacting the commercial bond and real estate markets and the overall economy 
as a result concord recorded other than temporary impairment charges of approximately million during the fourth quarter of with growing uncertainty in the commercial bond and real estate markets and the credit crunch impacting the overall financial markets during  concord assessed all its loan assets and loan securities and in recorded additional impairment charges and loan loss reserves of approximately million 
cdo on december   concord formed cdo  pursuant to which it financed its loan assets by issuing an aggregate of approximately million of investment grade debt 
concord retained an equity and junior debt interest in the portfolio with a notional amount of million  which it increased to million when it repurchased million in additional junior debt interest for million 
as a result  if cdo does not ultimately have sufficient funds to satisfy all of its obligations to its noteholders  concord will bear the first million in loss  our proportionate share of which would be million 
the financing through cdo was intended to enhance concord s return on the loan assets and loan securities held in cdo as the weighted average interest rate on the loan assets and loan securities held in cdo at december  was and the weighted average interest rate on the amount payable by concord on its notes at december  was 
accordingly  assuming the loan assets and loan securities are paid in accordance with their terms  concord retains an average spread of the difference between the interest received on the loan assets and loan securities and the interest paid on the loan assets and loan securities

on february   concord received a waiver of the retrospective covenant violation from keybank

repurchase facilities concord has financed certain of its loan assets and loan securities through credit facilities in the form of repurchase agreements 
in the repurchase agreements entered into by concord to date  the lender  referred to as the repurchase counterparty  purchases the loan asset or loan security from or on behalf of concord 
concord then repurchases the loan asset or loan security in cash on a specific repurchase date or  at the election of concord  an earlier date 
while the loan asset is held by the repurchase counterparty  the repurchase counterparty retains a portion of each interest payment made on such loan asset or loan security equal to the price differential which is effectively the interest rate on the purchase price paid the repurchase counterparty to concord for the loan asset or loan security  with the balance of such payments being paid to concord 
pursuant to the terms of the repurchase agreements  if the market value of the loan assets or loan securities pledged or sold by concord decline  which decline is determined  in most cases  by the repurchase counterparty  concord may be required to provide additional collateral or pay down a portion of the funds advanced 
during  concord was required to pay down an aggregate of million against million of outstanding repurchase obligations 
concord satisfied these amounts with cash flow  borrowings under its keybank credit facility and capital contributions from inland concord 
all of concord s repurchase facilities are recourse to concord and require concord to maintain certain loan to asset value ratios  a minimum net worth and minimum liquidity 
in addition  all of the repurchase facilities require that concord pay down borrowings under these facilities as principal payments on the loan assets and loan securities pledged to these facilities are received 
under the terms of three repurchase facilities  concord is required to maintain minimum liquidity  comprised of cash and cash equivalents  of at least million at all times 
at certain times during the year ended december  and at certain times subsequent to the year ended december   concord s cash balance declined to an amount below the million minimum liquidity requirements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our variable rate and fixed rate debt 
as of december  and  our consolidated variable rate indebtedness was approximately million and million  respectively  which represented and of total long term indebtedness  respectively 
during and  our variable rate indebtedness had a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
had the weighted average interest rate been basis points higher  our interest expense for and would have been increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  our consolidated fixed rate debt  including discontinued operations  was approximately billion and billion respectively  which represented and  respectively  of total long term indebtedness 
for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values 
the following fair values were determined using the interest rates that we believe our outstanding fixed rate debt would warrant as of december  and are indicative of the interest rate environment as of december   and do not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we estimate that the fair value of our fixed rate debt is billion as of december  our interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
we may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt 
currently  we have one interest rate swap agreement
