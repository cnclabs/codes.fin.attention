critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  the preparation of which in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due considerations to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
other accounting policies and estimates are detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this k

in addition  the company records specific reserves for receivable balances that are considered high risk due to known facts regarding the customer

the company uses a third party actuary to estimate the casualty insurance obligations on an annual basis 
in determining the ultimate loss and reserve requirements  the third party uses various actuarial assumptions including compensation trends  health care cost trends and discount rates 
the third party actuary also uses historical information for claims frequency and severity in order to establish loss development factors 
the actuarial calculation includes a margin of error to account for changes in inflation  health care costs  compensation and litigation cost trends as well as estimated future incurred claims 
this year  the company utilized a confidence level for estimating the ultimate outstanding casualty liability based on the actuarial report 
approximately of each claim should be equal to or less than the ultimate liability recorded based on the historical trends experienced by the company 
if the company chose a factor  the liability would have been increased by approximate million 
if the company chose a factor  the liability would have increased by approximately million 
this year the company used a investment rate to discount the estimated claims based on the historical payout pattern during and a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have impacted the liability by approximately  actual ultimate losses could vary from those estimated by the third party actuary
