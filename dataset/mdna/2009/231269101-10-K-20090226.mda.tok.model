item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a drug discovery and development company that is committed to leveraging our innovative signaling pathway drug technologies in seeking to develop next generation targeted cancer therapies 
in expanding our drug development efforts with respect to these targeted cancer programs  we are building upon our past experiences in targeting signaling pathways  including the hedgehog pathway 
we seek to conduct research programs both internally and through strategic collaborations 
our most advanced program is a first in class orally administered hedgehog pathway inhibitor program for which our collaborator genentech is conducting clinical trials on the lead molecule  gdc  including a pivotal phase ii clinical trial in advanced basal cell carcinoma patients as well as phase ii clinical trials in first line metastatic colorectal cancer and in advanced ovarian cancer patients 
we believe that gdc is the first hedgehog pathway inhibitor to advance to phase ii clinical testing 
the initiation of these clinical trials has provided us with an important source of financing  resulting in a total of  including the  we will receive in the first quarter of for the initiation of the pivotal phase ii trial 
in addition to these three clinical trials  a phase i clinical trial to treat medulloblastoma patients was initiated by a third party investigator under a cooperative research and development agreement crada between genentech and the national cancer institute nci 
we anticipate that additional clinical trials will be initiated in the future including phase ii clinical trials in small cell lung and pancreatic cancers  among others 
the initiation of trials conducted under the crada do not result in cash payments to us 
we believe  however  that such trials are important to the overall development of gdc since they may provide a greater opportunity to generate additional data in tumor types other than those currently under investigation by genentech 
our internal drug development efforts are focused on our proprietary targeted cancer programs 
however  unlike the hedgehog pathway  a majority of these targeted pathways have been clinically validated by others in various cancer indications 
by directing our efforts toward validated targets  we believe that we can expedite the drug development process by taking advantage of the accumulated scientific knowledge base relating to these targets and the molecules that have been developed to act on them 
these targeted cancer programs primarily consist of several proprietary drug programs that target multiple signaling pathways 
we believe that this approach of targeting multiple nodes in various signaling pathway networks may provide for a better therapeutic effect than many of the targeted cancer drugs currently marketed or in development 
our lead candidate from these programs is cudc  a small molecule that is currently in phase i clinical testing and is designed to target histone deacetylase hdac  epidermal growth factor receptor egfr and epidermal growth factor her 
in addition  we expect to file an investigational drug application ind for cudc  a heat shock protein hsp inhibitor  in mid and provided that we have adequate capital resources  begin clinical testing on this candidate shortly thereafter 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through license fees  contingent cash payments  research and development funding from our strategic collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities and debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we devote substantially all of our resources to our 
table of contents research and development programs 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and do not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we believe that near term key drivers to our success will include genentech s ability to continue to successfully advance its clinical trials for gdc  our ability to successfully enter into a material license or collaboration agreement for cudc and or cudc  our ability to continue to successfully enroll and treat patients in our phase i clinical trial for cudc and achieve the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial  our ability to successfully advance cudc through preclinical ind enabling studies and file an ind application for this compound in  and our ability to advance the preclinical development of other small molecule cancer drug candidates that we are developing under our proprietary pipeline of targeted cancer programs 
in the longer term  a key driver to our success will be our ability  and the ability of any current or future collaborator or licensee  to successfully commercialize drugs based upon our proprietary technologies 
collaboration agreements we are currently a party to a june collaboration with genentech relating to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor technologies and to an april collaboration with genentech relating to the wnt signaling pathway 
our past and current collaborations have generally provided for research  development and commercialization programs to be wholly or majority funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional contingent cash payments principally if specified development and regulatory approval objectives are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon the collaborations 
we are currently not receiving any research funding and we do not expect to receive such funding in the future from our current collaborator  genentech 
we currently expect to incur only nominal research and development costs under these collaborations related to the maintenance of licenses 
in addition  as a result of our licensing agreements with various universities  we are obligated to make payments to these university licensors when we receive certain payments from genentech 
as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of  in expenses related to such payments 
we also expect to incur general and administrative costs associated with our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program related to our share of intellectual property costs 
our current collaboration agreements are summarized as follows genentech hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration 
under the terms of the june agreement with genentech  we granted genentech an exclusive  global  royalty bearing license  with the right to sublicense  make  use  sell and import small molecule and antibody hedgehog pathway inhibitors 
we had responsibilities to perform certain funded preclinical research activities and  from january through august  co funded clinical development costs for certain products 
in november  genentech granted a license to f 
hoffmann laroche  ltd roche for ex us rights to gdc roche received this license pursuant to an agreement between genentech and roche under which genentech granted roche an option to obtain a license to commercialize certain genentech products in non us markets 
we believe that the collaborative worldwide development activities of genentech and roche could expand the potential value of this compound since roche brings significant additional clinical development and commercialization experience to advance and market gdc outside of the us genentech and roche have primary responsibility for worldwide clinical development  regulatory affairs  manufacturing and supply  formulation and sales and marketing 
we are not a party to this agreement between genentech and roche but we are eligible to receive cash payments for regulatory filing and approval objectives achieved and future royalties on products developed outside of the us  if any  under our june collaboration agreement with genentech 

table of contents pursuant to the collaboration agreement  in june genentech made up front payments of  which consisted of a  non refundable license fee payment and a payment of  in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
genentech also made license maintenance fee payments totaling  over the first two years of the collaboration 
we have entered into three amendments to the june collaboration agreement 
pursuant to the amendments  genentech increased its funded research commitment and extended its funding obligation through december as part of these amendments  genentech provided us with  in incremental research funding over the period from december to december at which time  all research funding ended 
we do not expect to receive additional future research funding from genentech or incur any material research costs related to this program 
to date  we have received  in cash payments for the achievement of certain development objectives under the terms of the agreement  and we will receive an additional  during the first quarter of for the february initiation of the pivotal phase ii clinical trial in advanced basal cell carcinoma 
in addition to these payments  we will be eligible to receive additional future cash payments from genentech only upon the achievement of additional specified clinical development and regulatory approval objectives as well as royalties on product sales if any hedgehog pathway inhibitor products are successfully developed and commercialized 
genentech wnt pathway collaboration 
in april  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genentech for discovery and development of small molecule compounds that modulate the wnt signaling pathway 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted genentech an exclusive royalty bearing license to make  use and sell the small molecule compounds that are modulators of the wnt pathway 
genentech paid us an up front license fee of  and funded  for research and development activities during the two year research term  which ended in march  at which time  genentech assumed further responsibility for any future development of this program 
genentech has also agreed to make cash payments to us that are contingent upon the successful achievement of certain research  development  clinical and drug approval objectives  as well as royalties on net product sales if product candidates derived from the collaboration are successfully commercialized 
if genentech does not advance drug candidates generated under this collaboration beyond the discovery research stage  we are not entitled to receive any future cash payments under this collaboration 
we can not predict whether genentech will continue to pursue the development of drug candidates under the agreement or whether any development objectives for which we may be entitled to a cash payment will be achieved 
stryker corporation bmp assignment and sale in december  we sold and assigned our bone morphogenetic protein  or bmp  technologies to stryker corporation 
under the agreement  stryker paid us  in exchange for the sale and assignment of all of our remaining bmp assets 
as a result of the transaction  stryker assumed all future costs subsequent to the december  effective date related to future development activities  as well as to the maintenance and prosecution of the patent portfolio 
under the terms of the agreements  we are entitled to contingent cash payments related to certain clinical development and sales objectives  if achieved 
we can not predict whether any development objectives under this agreement for which we may be entitled to a contingent cash payment will be achieved 
financial operations overview general 
our future operating results will largely depend on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate collaborators and the progress of drug candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations  if any  the timing of the receipt of payments  if any  from new or existing collaborators and the cost and outcome of any preclinical development or clinical trials then being conducted 
we anticipate that existing capital resources at december   together with the  we have earned and will receive from genentech during the first quarter of for the february initiation of a pivotal phase ii clinical trial in advanced basal cell carcinoma  should 
table of contents enable us to maintain current and planned operations into mid our ability to continue funding our planned operations is dependent upon the success of our collaborations with genentech  our ability to control our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through additional corporate collaborations  equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
in october  we implemented a plan to reduce our spending in various general and administrative and research and development expense areas  particularly costs associated with preclinical research 
spending reductions include decreases in contract medicinal chemistry and biology work that was being performed in china  and in personnel  legal and occupancy costs 
as we seek to reduce administrative expenses and our preclinical and discovery research costs  we expect that our expenses associated with the clinical development of cudc and the ind enabling studies underway for cudc will increase  resulting in an overall increase in our research and development expenses for future periods as compared to prior years 
we expect that our reductions in general and administrative expenses will result in modest decreases in such expenses in future periods 
a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity  capital requirements and ability to raise additional funds is set forth under part i  item a risk factors 
revenue 
we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for several years  if ever 
substantially all of our gross revenues to date have been derived from license fees  research and development payments  and other amounts that we have received from our strategic collaborators and licensees 
for the year ended december   each of the following parties accounted for a portion of our total revenue as follows genentech   or  stryker corporation   or  and wyeth   or 
we currently have two collaborations  both of which are with genentech 
we currently receive no research funding for our programs under collaboration with genentech and we do not expect to receive such funding in the future under these collaborations 
accordingly  our only source of revenues and or cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments and funded research and development that we may receive under new collaboration agreements  if any  contingent cash payments for the achievement of development objectives  if any are met  under new collaborations or our existing collaborations with genentech and royalty payments that are contingent upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon collaborations 
the timing of our entrance into any new collaboration agreements and any contingent cash payments under our existing collaboration agreements with genentech are not assured  cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
except for the  we will receive in the first quarter of under our hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech  we do not expect to receive additional contingent cash payments in under our ongoing collaborations based on our current estimates of these development programs 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop our drug candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel including stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses also include the costs of supplies and reagents  outside service costs including clinical research organizations and medicinal chemistry  consulting  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
although we have historically incurred research and development expenses under our collaborations with genentech  we are currently incurring only nominal research and development expenses for these programs which are limited to the maintenance of third party licenses 
for each contingent payment  if any  received under our collaborations with genentech  we would be obligated to make payments to these third parties and recognize the related expense 
our research and development programs  both internal and under collaboration  are summarized in the following table product candidate primary indication collaborator licensee status hedgehog pathway inhibitor gdc advanced basal cell carcinoma genentech pivotal phase ii gdc metastatic colorectal cancer genentech phase ii gdc advanced ovarian cancer genentech phase ii targeted cancer programs cudc hdac  egfr  her inhibitor cancer internal development phase i cudc hsp inhibitor cancer internal development development candidate other targeted cancer programs cancer internal development preclinical in the chart above  pivotal phase ii means that our collaborator genentech is currently treating human patients in a pivotal phase ii clinical trial  the primary objective of which is a therapeutic response in human patients 
the endpoints of this clinical trial  if positive  may serve as the basis for future new drug application nda submission by genentech 
phase ii means that our collaborator genentech is currently treating human patients in a phase ii clinical trial  the primary objective of which is a therapeutic response ie  for the metastatic colorectal cancer trial  progression free survival from randomization to disease progression or death 
phase i means that we are currently treating human patients in a phase i clinical trial  the principal purpose of which is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the compound being tested 
development candidate means that from our testing in several preclinical models of human disease of various compounds from a particular compound class  we have selected a single lead candidate for potential future clinical development and are seeking to complete the relevant safety  toxicology  and other data required to submit an ind application with the fda seeking to commence a phase i clinical trial 
preclinical means we are seeking to obtain evidence of therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of human disease of one or more compounds within a particular class of drug candidates 
because of the early stages of development of these programs  our ability and that of our collaborator to successfully complete preclinical and clinical studies of these drug candidates  and the timing of completion of such programs  is highly uncertain 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs which may affect our and our collaborators future results  including the scope  quality of data  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us or our collaborators  the results of future preclinical and clinical trials  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our drug candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and 
table of contents the cost and effectiveness of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any of our drug candidates 
any failure to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a further discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our research and development programs on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth above in part i  item a risk factors 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  stock based compensation expense and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  patent and accounting services 
patent costs include certain patents covered under collaborations  a portion of which is reimbursed by collaborators and a portion of which is borne by curis 
in october  we extended previously initiated efforts to reduce our spending in various general and administrative expense areas  including personnel  occupancy and legal services  among others 
as a result of these changes  we expect that our general and administration expenses will decline modestly in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates and judgments include the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets  revenue recognition  the value of certain liabilities and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
license fees and multiple element arrangements 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under 
table of contents the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a relative performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the relative performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the relative performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the relative performance method  as of each reporting period 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis and we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential  then the total payments under the arrangement  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory 
revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
in addition  if we are involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
substantive milestone payments 
our collaboration agreements may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance bonuses that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  
table of contents achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort on our part is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and  a reasonable amount of time passes between the up front license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
determination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and therefore the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
in addition  the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone could prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and  as a result  any additional milestone payments could also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable 
reimbursement of costs 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf are met  the amounts are determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  the royalty payments would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and therefore would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
we did not recognize any royalty revenues for the years ended december   or payments from curis as a vendor to a collaborator as a customer 
for revenue generating arrangements where we  as a vendor  provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator  as a customer  we apply the provisions of eitf eitf addresses the accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash payments to each other for services and or products 
a payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
payments to a customer that are deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of revenue  to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to date and of probable future revenues  which include any unamortized deferred revenue balances  under all arrangements with such customer and then as an expense 
payments that are not deemed to be a reduction of selling price would be recorded as an expense 
deferred revenue 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
significant judgments are required in the application of revenue recognition guidance 
for example  in connection with our existing and former collaboration agreements  we have historically recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue would be recognized 
short term deferred revenue would consist of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue  or applied against future co development costs  within the next fiscal year 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized in the next fiscal year would be classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate would be based on our operating plan as of the balance sheet date and on our estimated performance periods under the collaboration in 
table of contents which we have recorded deferred revenues 
if our operating plan or our estimated performance period would change  we could recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the reporting period 
as of december   we had no remaining short or long term deferred revenue related to our collaborations 
the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations have consisted of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates could change 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments were to change over the course of these agreements  it could affect the timing and amount of revenue that we would recognize and record in future periods 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we have recorded employee stock based compensation expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the options outstanding as of december   we estimate that we will record approximately  to  in stock based compensation expense under sfas r in we expect that we will issue additional options in that will increase the amount of stock based compensation ultimately recognized 
the amount of the incremental employee stock based compensation expense attributable to employee stock options will depend primarily on the number of stock options issued to employees in  the fair market value of our common stock at the respective grant dates  and the specific terms of the stock options 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we used a black scholes pricing model for a majority of our stock awards and  for a small subset of our awards that contained a market condition  a lattice model 
both of these models require the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price the expected term of the option the grant date price of our common stock the expected volatility of our common stock the expected dividends on our common stock  which we do not anticipate paying for the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term of the variables above  we believe that the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas r  the grant date estimates of fair value associated with prior awards have not been changed 
the specific valuation assumptions that were utilized for purposes of deriving an estimate of fair value at the time that prior awards were issued are as disclosed in our prior annual reports on form k  as filed with the sec 
upon adoption of sfas r  we were also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur  and record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest 
accordingly  we performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting  and recorded total stock 
table of contents option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate for each of the quarterly periods in  and this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary to reflect the actual forfeitures for the reporting period 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas sfas no 
 fair value measurements for our financial assets and financial liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board staff position fsp no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 we will delay application of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  until january  sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
became effective january  and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
we did not elect to adopt the fair value option for eligible financial instruments under sfas no 
sfas no 
provides a framework for measuring fair value under us generally accepted accounting principles and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are i independent  ii knowledgeable  iii able to transact  and iv willing to transact 
sfas no 
requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach  the income approach and or the cost approach 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts  such as cash flows or earnings  to a single present amount on a discounted basis 
the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset replacement cost 
valuation techniques should be consistently applied 
sfas no 
also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs  where available  and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities have been classified as level assets 
we do not hold any asset backed or auction rate securities 
short term accounts receivable and accounts payable are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at net realizable value  which approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
in general  fair value is based upon quoted market prices  where available 
while we believe our valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and goodwill 
in the ordinary course of our business  we incur costs that at times have been substantial related to property and equipment 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
determining the economic lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
if it were determined that the carrying value of our other long lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure an impairment based on application of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
during  we initiated a realignment of our research programs  shifting our focus on later stage preclinical drug development programs and de emphasizing our earlier discovery research programs 
as a result  in we recorded an impairment charge of  related to certain of our equipment that was no longer used in our discovery or other programs 
in addition  we revised our estimates of the depreciable lives on the remaining equipment currently being used in our discovery research programs as a result of the conclusion of two of our discovery screening programs in late and early in march  our bmp small molecule screening agreement with centocor a johnson johnson subsidiary concluded in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
the bmp small molecule screening program was the only remaining program utilizing the majority of our existing discovery screening equipment 
we determined that we would not fund the bmp small molecule program internally 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded additional property and equipment impairment charges of  because this discovery equipment could not be used on other ongoing programs 
we assess the impairment of identifiable long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually 
since january   we have applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment assessment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill may be impaired 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests in december  and  and determined that as of those dates our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in  and our discussion of our critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

we expect that our future research and development contract revenues will be limited to expenses that we incur on behalf of our collaborator  genentech  for which genentech is obligated to reimburse us 
in addition  our license revenues decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to the recognition of  revenue under our june hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech during resulting from changed facts and circumstances related to our joint steering committee performance obligations 
this amount had been previously deferred indefinitely 
in addition  we recorded  in license fee revenues received from genentech as a contingent cash payment during the year ended december   and we recorded  in license fee revenues received from genentech related to contingent cash payments received during the year ended december  license revenues recognized under our collaborations with procter gamble and wyeth decreased  and  respectively  as a result of the conclusion of these collaborations 
these decreases were offset by  in license revenue recognized for the sale and assignment of our remaining bmp assets to stryker corporation during the year ended december

our lead targeted drug development candidate  cudc  which was selected for clinical development in march and for which we initiated a phase i clinical trial in august  accounted for a decrease in spending of  offsetting these decreases  spending on our second development candidate  cudc  accounted for an increase in spending of  we expect that our targeted cancer programs will consist of a majority of our ongoing future research and development expenses for the foreseeable future 
during the year ended december   we also incurred expenses of  an increase of  over the same prior year period  related to  in sublicense payments we were required to make under our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program as a result of the  in contingent payments received from genentech for the achievement of clinical development objectives during during  we incurred sublicense payments of  related to this program

stock based compensation decreased  for the year ended december  as a result of the grant of stock options for a smaller number of shares  and related expense  awarded during compared to the prior year period 
in addition  legal services decreased  primarily due to costs associated with foreign patent applications in the prior year period  and employee costs decreased  for the year ended december   employee costs related to bonuses and k matching contribution costs were  we did not incur such costs during due to spending reductions taken in an effort to conserve cash 
in furtherance of these efforts  our executive officers reduced their respective salaries in october in exchange for stock options and restricted stock 
offsetting these decreases  occupancy and depreciation costs increased  as a result of proceeds received under a settlement agreement entered into with a former subtenant that had defaulted on a sublease of our moulton street facility during the year ended december  other income expense for the year ended december   interest income was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or

the net decrease was due to decreases in research funding and substantive milestone revenues offset by an increase in license revenues 
the decrease in research and development contracts of  was the result of the conclusion of research funding in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of under four collaborations  including the conclusion of the research funding portion of our hedgehog pathway inhibitor and wnt collaborations with genentech  a sponsored research agreement with the sma foundation and a screening agreement with centocor 
the termination of research funding under these arrangements accounted for  of the decrease in research and development contract revenues 
in addition  during the first quarter of wyeth decreased from eight to five the number of our researchers supported by wyeth under our hedgehog agonist program 
license revenues increased  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the recognition of  in revenue under our june hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we could not estimate the performance period related to our ongoing joint steering committee obligation under this collaboration and therefore deferred  in payments that we had received from genentech in prior years 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of changed facts and circumstances  we concluded that our joint steering committee performance obligation had become inconsequential and perfunctory to the agreement 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of we recorded as licensing revenues the  in previously deferred revenues as well as  from a contingent cash payment that we received in october in addition  we accelerated recognition of license fee revenue related to our september collaboration with procter gamble  since 
table of contents procter gamble terminated this collaboration effective november this termination resulted in a decrease in our estimated performance period under this collaboration  resulting in additional revenue of  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in license fee revenues under our june hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech and our september collaboration with procter gamble were partially offset by decreases in license fee revenues for two of our other research programs 
we recorded  in license revenue during under our april wnt collaboration with genentech  as compared to  for the prior year period 
in addition  during the year ended december   we recognized  in license fee revenue as part of a settlement agreement with a former collaborator  micromet 
we did not record any license fee revenue under this agreement in we also recorded  in substantive milestone revenue during the year ended december  under our june collaboration with genentech 
in addition  we did not record contra revenues for the year ended december  compared to contra revenues of  for the year ended december  on august   we ceased our participation in a co development arrangement with genentech of a basal cell carcinoma drug candidate pursuant to which we had been recording contra revenues

this is due to the result of several offsetting variances within our various programs 
we increased spending by  for the internal development of our targeted cancer drug development programs  including cudc  as we shifted spending from several previously funded programs that have concluded 
these previously funded programs decreased by  from the prior year period and included i the conclusion in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of of the research funding under our ongoing hedgehog pathway inhibitor and our wnt signaling pathway collaborations with genentech  ii the termination by procter gamble of a september hedgehog agonist collaboration agreement for hair loss  and iii the conclusion of a sponsored research agreement with the sma foundation and a bmp small molecule screening agreement with centocor  both to conduct discovery research activities 
spending on our collaborator funded program with wyeth decreased  as a result of fewer researchers supporting the respective program 
funding on this program concluded in february in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

table of contents stock based compensation expense also decreased  as a result of a decline in the grant date fair value of stock options issued in as compared to  which resulted in lower compensation expense 
as the research funding concluded on programs under collaboration and as we shifted our research focus  we reallocated certain of these resources to our internal targeted cancer drug development programs  including cudc  which we initiated in the first half of these programs accounted for  or  of our research and development expense compared to  for the same prior year period  an increase of  general and administrative expenses are summarized as follows for the year ended december  percentage increase decrease personnel occupancy and depreciation legal services consulting and professional services insurance costs other general and administrative expenses stock based compensation total general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased  or  for the year ended december  as compared to as a result of expense reductions in most cost categories  offset by increases in spending for legal services and other administrative expenses 
these decreases included our receipt in of  in proceeds under an april settlement agreement entered into with a former subtenant that had defaulted on a sublease of our moulton street facility 
we recorded  of this amount as a reduction of expense 
in addition  our lease on our moulton street facility concluded on april   which reduced our overall occupancy costs 
professional and consulting services decreased  as a result of expenses incurred for the restatement of our prior financial statements during the first quarter of and costs incurred during associated with the formation of our chinese subsidiary  including technology evaluations and review of business development opportunities in china 
in addition  personnel costs and stock based compensation decreased  and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense decreased as a result of a decline in the grant date fair value of stock options issued in as compared to  which resulted in lower compensation expense 
offsetting these decreases  legal services increased  as a result of increased spending related to our patent portfolio  including filings related to cudc  other programs under our targeted cancer drug development platform and foreign patent applications 
other general and administrative costs are comprised of travel costs  temporary help  and computer and office supplies 
these costs increased  primarily due to increased travel costs and higher nasdaq filing fees resulting from our august private placement

net loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the foregoing  we incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through license fees  contingent cash payments and research and development funding from our collaborators and licensors  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  excluding restricted long term investments of  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations 
we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
while as of the date of this filing  we are not aware of any downgrades  material losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or marketable securities since december   no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or marketable securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives 
further dislocations in the credit market may adversely impact the value and or liquidity of marketable securities owned by us 
the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office and laboratory  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  laboratory supplies  consulting fees and legal fees 
during the third quarter of  we began incurring clinical costs associated with our phase i trial of cudc we expect that costs associated with clinical studies will increase in future periods assuming that cudc advances into further stages of clinical testing and other of our targeted cancer drug candidates reach clinical trials 
to date  the primary source of our cash flows from operations has been payments received from our collaborators and licensors 
as a result of the conclusion of all research funding  the majority of our research and development effort and expense has shifted from our programs that were funded under collaborations relating to the hedgehog pathway and various discovery and preclinical programs to the development of our targeted cancer programs  particularly for our lead targeted cancer drug candidate  cudc  and cudc  which we selected as a development candidate in july and is currently being evaluated in ind enabling studies 
while we are seeking a corporate collaborator for one or more of our targeted cancer programs  we are currently progressing the research and development of these programs on our own 
we believe that our research and development expenses will increase in future years in connection with our plans to continue phase i clinical testing for cudc and to progress cudc in preclinical testing toward an anticipated ind filing in mid we are actively seeking collaborators for our targeted cancer drug candidates  particularly cudc  but have not reached advanced stages of negotiation with any party 
our intention is to enter into a license 
table of contents or collaboration agreement with cudc prior to initiation of phase i clinical testing 
if we are unable to consummate such a transaction  we would consider our further development options for cudc our ability to progress cudc would depend on a number of factors including  our future cash position and the overall financial markets  and phase i data generated by cudc  among others 
in general  our only source of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments and funded research and development that we may receive under new collaboration agreements  if any  contingent cash payments for the achievement of development objectives  if any are met  under new collaborations or our existing collaborations with genentech and royalty payments that are contingent upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon collaborations 
the timing of or entrance into any new collaboration agreements and any contingent cash payments under our existing collaboration agreements with genentech are not assured  cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  in addition  changes in certain operating assets and liabilities affected operating cash during the year ended december   including a decrease in deferred revenue of  as a result of the recognition of the  license fee that we received in december under our bmp transaction with stryker corporation and a decrease of  in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
offsetting these decreases were noncash items stock based compensation expense of  and depreciation of  cash used in operating activities during the years ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  in addition  changes in certain operating assets and liabilities offset these increases in operating cash during year ended december  specifically  our deferred revenue decreased  as a result of accelerated license fee amortization under our genentech and procter gamble collaborations 
offsetting this decrease  our accounts receivables decreased  primarily related to our microment settlement  and our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased  finally  several noncash items further offset our net loss  including stock based compensation expense of  depreciation of  and impairment of assets of  we expect to continue to use cash in operations as we continue to seek to advance our targeted cancer drug programs through preclinical testing and into clinical development 
in addition  in the future we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensors based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and other specified objectives 
investing activities provided cash of  for the year ended december   resulting from  in net investment sales to fund ongoing operations 
investing activities used  of cash for the year ended december   resulting from  in net investment purchases primarily related to investment of funds received from our august private placement 
in addition  for the year ended december   we received  in net proceeds from the sale of certain of our assets used to pay down our outstanding principal obligations to the boston private bank trust company 
we currently do not expect to undertake any significant capital projects during financing activities used cash of approximately  for the year ended december   resulting from repayment of  on our notes with the boston private bank trust company  which were canceled in april this decrease in cash was offset by cash received of  upon the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities provided cash of  for the year ended december   resulting primarily from  received in issuances of common stock  including net proceeds of  from our august private placement of common stock and  received upon the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
offsetting these increases in cash  we repaid  of our term debt with the boston private bank trust company 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   we had future payments required under contractual obligations and other commitments  including an operating lease related to our facility  research services agreements  consulting agreements  and license agreements  as follows payment due by period amounts in s total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating lease obligations outside service obligations licensing obligations total future obligations outside service obligations consist of agreements we have with outside labs  consultants and various other service organizations 
in the future  we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensees based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and specified other objectives 
these potential future obligations are not included in the above table 
we anticipate that existing capital resources at december   together with the  we will receive from genentech in the first quarter of  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into mid we expect to incur substantial additional research and development and other costs  including costs related to preclinical studies and clinical trials  for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue funding planned operations beyond mid is dependent upon  among other things  the success of our collaborations  our ability to control our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through additional corporate collaborations  equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
we are seeking additional collaborative arrangements and also anticipate that we will seek to raise funds through one or more financing transactions  if conditions permit 
due to our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to seek to raise funds through the sale of debt or equity securities when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
our general business strategy may be adversely affected by the recent economic downturn and volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
if the current equity and credit markets deteriorate further  or do not improve  it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult or impossible  more costly  and more dilutive 
failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy  financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans 
in addition  there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers  manufacturers and other partners may not survive these difficult economic times  which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget 
see part i  item a risk factors  for a further discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity  capital requirements and ability to raise additional capital 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations since inception

we have historically entered into collaborative arrangements in which this issue would be applicable  however  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as it relates to joint operating activities under current collaborations 
management will have to evaluate the impact of this issue on future collaborations that we may enter into 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our current cash balances in excess of operating requirements are invested in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  which consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations with an average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
this objective may be adversely affected by the recent economic downturn and volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
while as of the date of this filing  we are not aware of any downgrades  material losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or marketable securities since december   no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or marketable securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives 
further dislocations in the credit market may adversely impact the value and or liquidity of marketable securities owned by us 
our investments are investment grade securities  and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we currently have the ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to recover the fair value of the investment and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the fair value of the investment is recoverable 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a change in interest rate percentages would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income
