item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including business  selected financial data  and financial statements and supplementary data  as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this md a contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations  beliefs and strategies and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the risk factors section 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements 
see risk factors and special note regarding forward looking statements in this report on form k and the risks discussed in other reports we have furnished or filed from time to time with the sec 
our business general actuate corporation we  actuate or the company was incorporated in november in the state of california and reincorporated in the state of delaware in july actuate provides software and services to develop and deploy rich internet applications ria that deliver rich interactive content that improve customer loyalty and corporate performance 
applications built on actuate s open source based platform provide all stakeholders inside and outside the firewall  including employees  customers  partners and citizens with information that they can easily access and understand to maximize revenue  cut costs  improve customer satisfaction  streamline operations  create competitive advantage and make better decisions 
our goal is to ensure that all users can use decision making information in their day to day activities  opening up completely new avenues for improving corporate performance 
the software industry is currently experiencing significant challenges  primarily due to a deteriorating macroeconomic environment  which is primarily characterized by diminished product demand 
as a result of this downturn  some of our customers may face financial challenges in fiscal it is unclear when the macroeconomic environment may improve 
we are seeing increasing pressures on our customers information technology budgets  and therefore our customers are looking for more flexibility in the type of software and the timing of such purchases 
the current economic downturn in our customers industries has contributed to the reduction in our license revenues and could continue to adversely impact our future business  operating results and financial condition 
facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses  some of our customers are waiting to purchase our products and are increasingly seeking purchasing terms and conditions that are less favorable to us 
this trend has partially contributed to lower license revenues for fiscal and this trend may continue in fiscal our customers may also experience adverse changes in their business and  as a result  may delay or default on their payment obligations  file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products 
if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us  although these obligations are generally not cancelable 
additionally  our customers may seek to renegotiate existing contractual commitments 
though we have not yet experienced any unusual levels of defaults  any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

table of contents business model we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
fiscal year our total revenues for fiscal year were million  which were approximately lower than our prior fiscal year revenues of million 
license revenues decreased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to unfavorable economic conditions that began in late fiscal and continue to adversely impact the financial services industry  a key component of actuate s customer portfolio 
this decrease in license revenue was partially offset by a increase in services revenues 
this increase was primarily driven by maintenance and support revenues that continue to grow as our installed base increases 
for fiscal year  we reported net income of million or per diluted share compared to net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal year this decrease in net income was driven primarily by the lower license revenues over the same period last year 
our operating margin decreased from million or of total revenues in fiscal year to million  or of total revenues in fiscal year our operating margins were negatively impacted by approximately  as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which positively impacted our revenues by approximately  and negatively impacted our expenses by approximately  for fiscal year in order to size the operations to meet the expected business and economic environment for our products  we implemented a restructuring plan during the second half of the year to eliminate positions held by actuate employees primarily in north america 
this restructuring impacted all functional areas 
the reduction in force was completed in fiscal year the restructuring plan also resulted in the recognition of costs related to the consolidation of facilities  the cancellation of certain lease contracts and the write off of fixed assets located at facilities that have been vacated 
in early november of  we entered into a revolving credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  llc wff  part of wells fargo company 
the credit agreement provided for a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of up to million and was arranged in anticipation of a stock buyback through a modified dutch auction tender offer in december the tender offer was successfully completed in late december and resulted in repurchase of approximately million shares at a price of per share 
the offering resulted in a total cost of million and was equally funded with both cash reserves and borrowings from the credit agreement with wff 
prior to the commencement of the tender offer in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we had repurchased an additional million shares through our accelerated stock buy back program that was authorized by our board in early february recent us sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets  causing global credit and liquidity issues 
the short term funding markets experienced credit issues during fiscal this led to liquidity disruption in asset backed commercial paper and failed auctions in the auction rate market 
if the global credit market continues to deteriorate  our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are other than temporarily impaired 
this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we own investments in marketable securities that have been designated as available for sale or trading securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported in 
table of contents accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in results of operations 
at december   we held million par value of investments comprised of ars  which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest rate being reset through dutch auctions that are typically held every days 
prior to february  the securities had historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer 
interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually 
at december   all of the ars we held were aaa aaa rated  with most collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
in november  we elected to participate in a rights offering by ubs  our investment broker  which provides us with rights the put option to sell ubs million of our ars portfolio at par value  at any time during a two year sale period beginning june  by electing to participate in the rights offering  we granted ubs the right  exercisable at any time prior to june  or during the two year sale period  to purchase or cause the sale of our ars the call right 
ubs has stated that it will only exercise the call right for the purpose of restructurings  dispositions or other solutions that will provide their clients with par value for their ars 
ubs has agreed to pay their clients the par value of their ars within one day of settlement of any call right transaction 
notwithstanding the call right  we are permitted to sell ars to parties other than ubs  in which case the put option attached to the ars that are sold would be extinguished 
we classified the put option as a non current security 
as such  we recorded a net realized loss of approximately  related to the difference between the gain recognized on the put option and the realized loss on the million par value portion of our ars portfolio 
we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ars are presently at risk of default 
through december   we have continued to receive interest payments on the ars in accordance with their terms 
we believe we will ultimately be able to liquidate our ars related investments without significant loss primarily due to the collateral securing ars and the legal settlements we have entered into with ubs 
however  it could take until final maturity of the ars up to years to realize our investments par value 
due to the changes and uncertainty in the ars market  we believe the recovery period for these investments is likely to be longer than months and as a result  we have classified these investments as long term as of december  since february  most ars auctions have failed for these securities and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed and  as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the par value in the near term may be limited non existent 
in the event the company needs to access these funds  it will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  unless a future auction on these investments is successful 
the company has reduced the carrying value of these ars investments as of december  through a charge to other income expense 
this reduction was largely offset by a gain recognized on the put option described above 
the net reduction amounted to approximately  the company will evaluate these investments on a quarterly basis 
for additional discussion please refer to the note of our consolidated financial statements 
during the first half of fiscal year  we recorded facility related restructuring charges totaling  these charges primarily related to lease exit costs associated with our south san francisco facility  the closure of one of the three floors in our toronto  canada facility and the consolidation of our vienna  virginia facilities into one location 
we also incurred approximately  in legal fees related to a previous restructuring which involved the terminations of former employees in one of our european subsidiaries 
during the second half of fiscal year  we recorded approximately million in costs consisting of severance  benefits and related legal fees when we initiated a restructuring of our north america sales force to size the operation to meet the expected business and economic environment 
this restructuring resulted in workforce reductions of total personnel and was concentrated mainly in north america across all levels of the sales organization 

table of contents all restructuring charges were accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
our total headcount at the end of fiscal year was compared to employees at the end of last year 
fiscal year a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers in the financial services industry 
the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from these financial services customers for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions starting in late fiscal have adversely impacted the financial services industry throughout fiscal if this trend continues into  it will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently anticipate that our total revenues in fiscal year will be lower than those levels experienced in fiscal year  and fiscal year license revenues may decrease by as much as from fiscal year levels 
during fiscal year  we expect three additional trends to continue that would have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow only modestly if at all in the fiscal year  particularly among financial services companies in the united states 
second  corporations are reluctant to buy software from new vendors and we continue to witness corporations consolidating their business intelligence  ria and performance management software purchases into fewer suppliers 
finally  we expect to experience vigorous competition in the ria market 
several of our competitors have released products that are marketed to be directly competitive with our ria offerings 
the existence of these competitive products may require additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which could result in extended sales cycles 
we believe that competition in the ria market will be vigorous in the near future 
for fiscal year  we will continue to pursue the strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth that we began introducing in fiscal year as well as an initiative related to performance management  which we introduced in fiscal these initiatives are as follows selling to it management we are re focusing our sales efforts on selling our products to it managers who we believe generally recognize the technical advantages of our products 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short term 
solution selling to line of business management we are creating performance management applications and software solutions to market to line of business managers 
these offerings are in the areas of performance management and customer self service reporting 
we hope these initiatives will result in increased license revenue over the medium to long term 
investing in birt we are continuing to make a significant investment in creating a new open source business intelligence and reporting tool  known as birt 
we hope that birt will eventually become widely adopted by java developers and will create demand for our other commercially available products 
the birt project is a long term initiative 
selling to global corporations in the financial services sector we are continuing to focus on selling our products to global financial services companies in an effort to increase our substantive market share in this sector 
we anticipate a negative impact of the ongoing credit crunch on the financial services sector in however  we believe that once the short term issues in financial services are resolved  the industry will once again lead in the adoption of ria both inside and outside the firewall 
delivering a highly differentiated performance management offering we intend to combine actuate performancesoft performance management applications and actuate s ria ready information platform to provide capabilities for distributing accountability throughout the enterprise 

table of contents we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  valuation and impairment of investments  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  contingencies  restructuring and integration costs  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see the discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
actuate generates revenues from sales of software licenses and related services 
the company receives software license revenues from licensing its products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers oems 
the company receives service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that actuate performs for customers 
actuate recognizes revenues in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
for sales to end user customers  actuate recognizes license revenues when a license agreement has been signed by both parties or a definitive agreement has been received from the customer  the product has been shipped  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence of sales to end users is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
actuate has not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for its licenses 
therefore  the company recognizes revenues from arrangements with multiple elements involving software licenses under the residual method 
if the license agreement contains payment terms that would indicate that the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as the payments become due and payable  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
actuate enters into reseller and distributor arrangements that typically give such distributors and resellers the right to distribute its products to end users headquartered in specified territories 
actuate recognizes license 
table of contents revenues from arrangements with us resellers and distributors when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the reseller or distributor  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
actuate recognizes license revenues from arrangements with international resellers and distributors upon receipt of evidence of sell through and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if it is not practical to obtain evidence of sell through  the company defers revenues until the end user has been identified and cash has been received 
in some instances there is a timing difference between when a reseller completes its sale to the end user and the period in which actuate receives the documentation required for revenue recognition 
because actuate delays revenue recognition until the reporting period in which the required documentation is obtained  it may recognize revenue in a period subsequent to the period in which the reseller completes the sale to its end user 
actuate also enters into oem arrangements that provide for license fees based on the bundling or embedding of its products with the oem s products 
these arrangements generally provide for fixed  irrevocable royalty payments 
actuate recognizes license fee revenues from us and international oem arrangements when a license agreement has been executed by both parties  the product has been shipped  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
credit worthiness and collectibility for end users are assessed based on payment history and current credit profile 
when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenues are deferred and recognized upon cash receipt 
actuate recognizes maintenance revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and unspecified product updates  ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to standard implementation and configuration 
training revenues are generated from classes offered at the company s headquarters and customer locations 
revenues from consulting and training services are typically recognized as the services are performed 
when a contract includes both  license and service elements  the license fee is typically recognized on delivery of the software  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the product and are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors 
we look at factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
these factors are reviewed to determine whether a specific reserve for bad debt should be recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also cease recognizing future revenues on any outstanding domestic maintenance renewal invoices which are older than days past due 
we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
a reserve percentage is applied to various aged categories of receivables based on historical experience to determine how much of an unspecified reserve is needed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
fair value of financial instruments and concentration of credit risk 
carrying amounts of our financial instruments including accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and long term debt approximate fair value 
the fair values of our cash equivalents  available for sale investments in marketable securities and derivative instruments are detailed further in note of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost was recognized based on the requirements of sfas r for a all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
fas r requires the use of judgment and estimates in performing multiple calculations 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future 
our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
our estimate of the expected term of options granted is derived from historical share option exercise experience 
in the future  we may change our estimate of the expected term 
this change could impact the fair value of our options granted in the future 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
sfas no 
requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
for fiscal year  we continue to believe there is sufficient positive evidence to support the utilization of our deferred tax assets 
this positive evidence includes the continued experience of generating net income and positive projections of future us and foreign net income 
we believe this constitutes significant positive evidence which indicates that there is no need for a valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets 
we do have certain deferred tax assets that require a valuation allowance 
a portion of our deferred tax assets are related to foreign net operating losses where there is sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance 
the remaining deferred tax assets that have a valuation allowance are related to research and development tax credits which have been previously benefited on a book basis 
a valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets is required until the credits are actually utilized 
at future dates  if sufficient positive evidence exists with regards to the foreign deferred tax assets and it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized with respect to the remaining deferred tax assets  we will release a portion of the remaining valuation allowance 
this adjustment to the valuation allowance depending on the respective deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense  reduce goodwill or intangibles and or increase shareholder s equity in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  if there is a reduction in the projection of future us and foreign net income and significant negative evidence exists  we would be required to increase the valuation allowance with respect to 
table of contents specific deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance depending on the respective deferred tax assets would increase tax expense  increase goodwill or intangibles or decrease shareholder s equity in the period such a determination was made 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin on january  fin prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  only income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized in the financial statements 
an income tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant judgment is required in applying the principles of fin and sfas no 
the calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations 
however  the final outcome of tax examinations  including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues  cannot be predicted with certainty 
in addition  we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination  we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 
on october   congress enacted hr  the emergency economic stabilization act of the act 
the act renewed the federal r d credit which previously expired on december  through the r d credits calculated in the income tax provision are estimates based on the expected final calculations which will be completed at the time the federal and california income tax returns are finalized 
contingencies 
we are or have been engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in litigation or settlement strategy for a particular matter 
accrual for restructuring charges 
during the fiscal years ended december   and we incurred certain restructuring charges that were a combination of reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and disposals of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred including estimates of sublease income on portions of our idle facilities that we periodically update based on market conditions and in accordance with our restructuring plans 
these estimates were impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
in process research and development 
we have recorded in process research and development as a component of our acquisitions 
at the time of these acquisitions  sfas business combinations was the relevant guidance 
subsequently  sfas r was issued which alters the treatment of in process research and development in accounting for business combinations 
however  sfas r treatment is only applicable prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  
table of contents in adherence to sfas  we reviewed our acquisitions and determined if there were any intangible assets relating to purchased in process research and development 
projects that had not achieved technological feasibility and had no alternative future use were valued at fair market value using a discounted cash flow analysis and were expensed in the consolidated statement of income on the date of acquisition 
we used a discount rate that reflected the development stage of the technology and the risks associated with attaining full technological and commercial feasibility 
when we valued in process research and development  we had to make a number of estimates  including the timing and amounts of future cash flows to be generated as a result of the projects  how close the projects were to technological feasibility and how much risk and cost were involved in finalizing the projects 
it was reasonably likely that our estimates for these amounts would differ from actual results  in which case our in process research and development charge may have been over or under valued  which would also have resulted in an under or over valuation of our goodwill 
valuation of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  customer lists  non compete agreements  experienced workforce  and trademarks 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if the assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  we will reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
as of december  the net carrying amount of our intangible assets was million 
we evaluate goodwill at least annually for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that there was no impairment 
valuation of minority interest in actuate japan 
the minority shareholders of actuate japan have the non expiring option to put their equity interest minority interest in actuate japan to the company and the company has the option to call the minority interest 
the minority interest as of december  was approximately of the total equity interest 
if the minority interest shareholder chose to put these remaining shares to the company  actuate would be required to pay approximately  to purchase these shares 
the company will record a liability  if any  at the time that the put or call is probable of being exercised 
should an indicator arise that the minority interest has declined in value below the exercise price of the put and call option  the company would conclude that exercise is probable at that point in time and recognize a liability for the intrinsic value of the option 
the company performs a periodic review of the value of the minority interest 
this review may include making assumptions regarding projected future cash flows and discount rates 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the company s conclusion as to whether it is necessary to record a liability 
as of december   the company concluded that it was not necessary to record a liability 
the company consolidated of the operating results of actuate japan and all investments in the subsidiary are eliminated in consolidation 
as of the date of this filing  the remaining minority shareholder has not notified the company of any intent to exercise its put option 
recoverability of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets periodically by analyzing its operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
at some point in the future  we may determine that our long lived assets are impaired 
the timing 
table of contents of such impairment may result in charges to our consolidated statement of income to reduce the value of the asset carried on our consolidated balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge based on various assumptions and estimates 
assumptions and estimates about future values can be complex and are often subjective 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of income data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license fees maintenance professional services and training total revenues costs and expenses cost of license fees cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of other intangibles purchased in process research and development restructuring charges total costs and expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before income taxes benefit from income taxes net income revenues year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands our revenues are derived from license fees and services  which include software maintenance and support  consulting  and training 
the decrease in total revenue for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to lower demand for our products as a result of unfavorable economic conditions that began in late fiscal year and continue to adversely impact the financial services industry  a key component of our customer portfolio 
as a result  license sales experienced a decline of approximately over the prior year 

table of contents we experienced declines in license sales across most of our sales regions including or approximately million in north america and or approximately million outside north america 
professional services revenues decreased and was primarily the result of the continued increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not result in professional service revenues to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
our birt related business increased by approximately over the same period last year 
the success of the company s birt initiative therefore results in a downward trend in the company s revenue from professional services  as seen during the last two fiscal years 
our birt related business is expected to grow at a rate of approximately in fiscal year these decreases in license and consulting revenues were partially offset by an or million increase in maintenance and support revenues over the same period last year 
of this increase in maintenance and support revenues  the majority was attributable to normal growth in support for our installed base 
since our existing renewal rate remains high  we anticipate maintenance revenues to continue to grow in regardless of software license growth 
for fiscal year we managed to close approximately transactions in excess of  compared to in fiscal year in addition  we recognized license revenue of million or more on transactions during fiscal year compared to transactions in fiscal year the number of orders greater than million has historically ranged from none to three per quarter 
we do not expect to rely on any one customer for our future business 
the increase in total revenue for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in demand and a wider acceptance of our products by global customers companies with annual revenues greater than billion 
this wider acceptance resulted in an increase in the number of large dollar value license deals deals in excess of million over fiscal year we experienced a increase in our maintenance and support revenues 
approximately of this increase related to a transaction with a customer who was out of compliance with its maintenance agreement and accordingly paid back maintenance 
we also experienced a growth in international license sales 
finally  the expansion of our birt initiative and application of our business intelligence  performance management and reporting products and services resulted in the expansion of our products across more diverse industry groups in fiscal year including retail  government  technology and health care

total license revenues were positively impacted by approximately  due primarily to the strength of the asian currencies against the us dollar 
as a percentage of total revenues  license fee revenues decreased from in the fiscal year to in fiscal year the european region realized the most significant license revenue growth in fiscal year from fiscal year approximately million of this growth was due to exchange rate fluctuations as a result of the strength of the euro and the british pound against the us dollar

the increase in services revenues was driven by the growth in our maintenance and support revenues  which continued to increase in fiscal year the fourth quarter of included an unusually large million maintenance catch up transaction 
excluding this one time transaction for back maintenance  fiscal year maintenance revenue increased by over fiscal year the increase in the installed base was evidenced by the fact that in fiscal year we were supporting a large percentage of the million in licenses sold in fiscal year  while our maintenance declination rate has remained consistent as we continue to experience high renewal rate from our existing customers 

table of contents the decrease in professional services revenues was primarily the result of the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
our birt related business increased by approximately over the same period last year 
the success of the company s birt initiative therefore results in a downward trend in the company s revenue from professional services  as seen during the last two fiscal years 
due to this increased trend in birt related business  we continued to experience reductions in our services headcount in fiscal year versus the same period last year 
by region  europe accounted for the highest increase in services revenues for these increases were due primarily to the growth in our installed base of customers under maintenance plans in that region 
the growth in services revenues for fiscal year versus fiscal year was primarily attributed to the increase in our maintenance and support revenues driven by a continued growth in our installed base of customers under maintenance plans 
the increase in the installed base was evidenced by the fact that in fiscal year we supported a large percentage of the million in licenses sold in fiscal year  while our maintenance declination rate has remained consistent 
in addition  we concluded a transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year with one of our customers who was out of compliance on their maintenance agreements 
this arrangement brought the customer current on their maintenance and included approximately million of revenue related to maintenance periods preceding fiscal year  but was recognized in fiscal year the amount related to the prior year was less than of total revenue 
the increase in maintenance revenue was offset by a decrease in professional services revenues 
this decrease was primarily the result of the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not generate professional service revenues to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
the success of the company s birt initiative therefore resulted in a reduction in the company s revenue from professional services during the year

table of contents cost of license fees consists primarily of salaries  production costs including printing and packaging  amortization of purchased technologies  third party royalty fees and localization costs 
the decreases in cost of license fees in absolute dollars for fiscal year  compared to the prior year  was due primarily to full amortization of purchased technologies totaling approximately  in fiscal year relating to our acquisition of nimble technologies  which was acquired in fiscal year the decrease in cost of license fees for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was not significant

the decrease in cost of services in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily driven by a decrease in our consulting headcount which consequently resulted in reductions in employee salaries  associated benefits and employee travel costs totaling approximately million 
this decrease was primarily driven by the adoption of birt based projects by our customers 
birt based projects do not generate professional service revenues to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
we also realized reductions in facilities related charges of approximately  due partially to the closure of our service facility in iselin  new jersey in the second half of fiscal year these reductions were offset by an approximately  increase in third party consulting fees as demand for actuate s professional services engagements during the first half of fiscal year exceeded the supply of in house consultants 
the decrease in cost of services in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a reduction in headcount from employees at the end of fiscal year to employees at the end of fiscal year in addition  in fiscal year we also made a shift in company practice to reduce the use of outside third party consultants  thereby reducing costs 
third party consulting revenue decreased by from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year also  there was lower demand for our professional services during as compared to last year primarily due to the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not generate professional service revenues to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
finally  there was a reduction in the allocation of sales support to the services function due to a decrease in professional consulting revenues

for fiscal year  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily due to decreases in salaries  sales commissions and employee travel of approximately million due to lower software sales and reductions in headcount 
total sales and marketing headcount decreased from at december  to at december  these decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately million in marketing expenses driven by webinars  direct marketing  and tradeshows 
in fiscal year  we also recorded approximately  in accrued legal fees related to a one time employee termination charge as a result of the termination of a sales employee in our european division 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year over was primarily due to increases in salaries  sales commissions  related compensation and employee recruiting costs totaling approximately million 
these increases were driven by higher headcount in fiscal year and an increase in software license sales 
in addition  as a result of lower consulting revenues  fewer sales support costs were allocated from sales and marketing to our professional services group in fiscal year these increases in cost were partially offset by an approximately  decrease in travel and entertainment expense mainly due to improved cost controls

the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year  was attributed to employee compensation and related costs driven mainly by annual salary adjustments and stock compensation expense 
our headcount remained comparable at at the end of fiscal year compared to at the end of fiscal year this increase in employee compensation expense was partially offset by decreases in facilities related charges due partially to the consolidation of our vienna  virginia facilities into one location and lower fees paid to external contractors 

table of contents the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  was attributed to employee compensation driven by a increase in our product development headcount  primarily in our shanghai research and development facility 
this increase was partially offset by lower professional consulting costs used for research and development purposes

the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was mainly due to increased salaries and stock based compensation expense of approximately million due primarily to annual salary adjustments and a increase in headcount over the same period last year 
we also experienced increases in legal and corporate advisory fees totaling approximately  in fiscal year related to advice regarding strategic alternatives 
these increases were partially offset by approximately  in lower general accounting  tax and professional consulting services driven by lower sox compliance costs 
in addition  in fiscal year  we experienced approximately  lower costs for strategic consulting services in support of our birt initiative 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a increased stock based compensation expense of approximately million which was driven primarily by the issuance of new grants during fiscal year as well as increased stock prices during the year  b  increase in bad debt expense  which was primarily due to the fact that fiscal year bad debt expenses were unusually low as a result of significant improvements in our accounts receivable aging  and c increase in strategic consulting services of approximately  provided in support of our birt initiative

these annual impairment tests have not resulted in an impairment of recorded goodwill in fiscal  or for each year ended december   and we recorded  for the amortization of other purchased intangibles 
these costs represent the amortization of the intangibles associated with the acquisition of performancesoft on a straight line basis

this charge was directly related to the consolidation of our three offices located in the united kingdom into one office 
these restructuring charges were accounted for in accordance with sfas  which requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
during the second half of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge related to the relocation of our headquarters facility from south san francisco to san mateo  california and the closure of our service facility in iselin  new jersey 
these charges were primarily comprised of rent and operating expenses through the end of the lease term for the fully vacated portion of the south san francisco facility  impairment of fixed assets and leasehold improvements considered abandoned  and relocation costs to the new facility 
we also recorded restructuring charges for rent and operating expenses for the iselin  new jersey facility 
as a result of these relocations  we recorded a total restructuring charge of approximately million in the second half of fiscal year in accordance with sfas during the first half of fiscal year  we recorded facility related restructuring charges totaling  these charges primarily related to lease exit costs associated with our south san francisco facility  the closure of one of the three floors in our toronto  canada facility and the consolidation of our vienna  virginia facilities into one location 
we also incurred approximately  in legal fees related to a previous restructuring which involved the terminations of former employees in one of our european subsidiaries 
in order to size the operations to meet the expected business and economic environment  we implemented a restructuring plan during the second half of the year to eliminate positions held by actuate employees primarily in north america 
this restructuring impacted all functional areas 
the reduction in force was completed in fiscal year the restructuring plan also resulted in the recognition of costs related to the consolidation of facilities  the cancellation of certain contracts and the write off of fixed assets located at facilities that have been vacated

for the year ended december   the decrease in interest and other income was due primarily to a lower weighted average interest rate on our investments resulting in a decrease in interest income 
in addition  we recorded interest expense totaling approximately  on the utilized portion of our credit facility with wff 
we also recorded commitment fees and capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately  that are being amortized in accordance with sfas  accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases over the term of the credit facility 
we incurred foreign exchange losses that were primarily the result of sharp devaluations of the british pound  the euro and the us dollar currencies held by our swiss subsidiary against the swiss franc mainly during the first half of fiscal year 
table of contents the increase for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate received on our investments which resulted in approximately million in higher interest income  offset by accrued interest on the performancesoft earnout obligation and translation losses due to a weaker us dollar compared to major foreign currencies in fiscal year we expect interest and other income to decrease in fiscal year as we expect interest rates to remain low and we expect to incur a full year of interest charges under the credit facility signed with wff in late fiscal year benefit from income taxes year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands the benefit from income taxes represents primarily federal  state and foreign taxes as adjusted for the impact of operating losses utilized  income tax credits benefited and the reversal or establishment of reserves

the increase in the benefit for income taxes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the tax benefit expected on the us income tax returns for write off of the investment in and specific loans related to the tax liquidation of a foreign subsidiary 
additionally  there was a decrease in the provision for income taxes due to a million and million benefit from the decrease in the valuation allowance in and  respectively 
the decrease in the valuation allowance in fiscal year was the result of changes to our foreign deferred tax assets due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign tax rates and the expected utilization of specific deferred tax assets 
without the write off from the liquidation of the foreign subsidiary or the benefit from the decrease in the valuation allowance  there would have been an increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year the decrease in the valuation allowance in fiscal year was the result of management s determination that it was more likely than not that the deferred assets would be realized after weighing the applicable positive and negative evidence

table of contents the software industry is currently experiencing significant challenges  primarily due to a deteriorating macroeconomic environment  which is primarily characterized by diminished product demand 
as a result of this downturn  some of our customers may face financial challenges in fiscal it is unclear when the macroeconomic environment may improve 
we are seeing increasing pressures on our customers information technology budgets  and therefore our customers are looking for more flexibility in the type of software and the timing of such purchases 
the current economic downturn in our customers industries has contributed to the reduction in our license revenues and could continue to adversely impact our future business  operating results and financial condition 
facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses  some of our customers are waiting to purchase our products and are increasingly seeking purchasing terms and conditions that are less favorable to us 
this trend has partially contributed to lower license revenues for fiscal and this trend may continue in fiscal our customers may also experience adverse changes in their business and  as a result  may delay or default on their payment obligations  file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products 
if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us  although these obligations are generally not cancelable 
additionally  our customers may seek to renegotiate existing contractual commitments 
though we have not yet experienced any unusual levels of defaults  any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
fiscal cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon collection of monies from our license and maintenance agreements which consist of software fees and for ongoing support and unspecified product updates 
our maintenance revenues have remained robust over the past five years and have increased from of total revenues or million in fiscal year to of total revenues or million in fiscal year historically  the maintenance renewal rates have remained strong 
based on these factors  we believe that future proceeds from the maintenance renewals will be the primary source of our operating cash flows 
in order to fund our on going operations  we rely heavily on timely collections of our revenue stream 
we therefore continue to place emphasis on our collection efforts as indicated by reductions in the days sales outstanding dso in trade receivables which decreased from days at the end of fiscal year to days at the end of fiscal year we also continue to closely monitor the credit quality and payment history of our existing and new customers to better identify and minimize  in advance  the risk of our customers potential inability to make required payments 
the primary uses of cash from operations consist of salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to our employees 
these costs combined  accounted for approximately of our total operating expenses for both fiscal years and we pay our employees on a semi monthly basis and we generally pay our vendors within one month from receiving an invoice for services rendered 
we are also contractually committed to pay rent and facility related charges in support of our worldwide operations 
as of december   we remained contractually committed to million in net operating lease obligations related to our worldwide facilities and million in other operating and purchase obligations with our vendors 
the majority of these obligations are due within the next five years 
despite a challenging economic environment  we remain focused on increasing our cashflows from operations and improving our operating margins and profitability 
the current economic uncertainties have reduced our visibility in forecasting our future license revenues  from which we largely depend on achieving these goals 
as visibility associated with these future license revenues remain limited  we may  from time to time  rely on cost cutting and swift resizing measures to achieve our objective of growth in operating cashflows  operating margins and profitability 

table of contents our capital expenditures for the past two years have primarily consisted of leasehold improvements related to our headquarter facility in san mateo  california and software costs associated with our internal customer portal project 
we currently do not foresee material cash outlays associated with capital projects in the coming fiscal year and expect to see lowered cash payments associated with these activities 
in early november of  we entered into a revolving credit agreement with wells fargo foothill and secured a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of up to million 
during fourth quarter of fiscal year  we used million of our cash along with million of funds available through this credit facility to complete a million common stock buy back 
as of december   we owed million on the credit facility 
unpaid charges related to the issuance of the credit facility include legal and closing fees totaling approximately  at december  of these total fees  approximately  will be payable in fiscal year and the remainder in fiscal year we are also obligated to make monthly interest payments and expect to pay approximately million in interest on the outstanding million loan balance annually 
we expect that these payments will be made through fiscal year and total approximately million 
these payments may fluctuate depending on the outstanding principal balance and changes in interest rates 
we currently have full access to the remaining million of unused balance on the credit line and may use this amount to fund future operations or potential acquisitions 
because of our indebtedness  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is and will be required for debt service 
our levels of debt could have negative consequences for us 
it should be noted that a substantial portion of our cash flow is  and will be  dedicated to debt service and is not  and will not be  available for other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes may be impaired in the future  our borrowings are  and will be  at variable rates of interest  which may expose us to the risk of increases in interest rates  and our level of indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
we believe that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our current debt service requirements for interest and any required prepayments under the credit agreement 
however  if such cash flow is not sufficient  we may be required to issue additional debt or equity securities  refinance our obligations  or take other actions in order to make such scheduled payments 
we cannot be sure that we would be able to effect any such transactions on favorable terms  if at all and failure to do so may cause an event of default under the credit agreement  which will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial conditions 
similarly  the credit agreement includes limitations on the company s ability to incur debt  grant liens  make acquisitions  make certain restricted payments such as dividend payments  and dispose of assets 
the events of default under the credit agreement include payment defaults  cross defaults with certain other indebtedness  breaches of covenants and bankruptcy events 
in the case of a continuing event of default  the lenders under the credit agreement may  among other remedies  eliminate their commitments to make credit available  declare due all unpaid principal amounts outstanding  and require cash collateral for any letter of credit obligations and foreclose on all collateral which will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial conditions 
in november  we elected to participate in a rights offering by ubs  our investment broker  which provides us with the right the put option to sell ubs million of our ars portfolio at par value  which we purchased through ubs  at any time during a two year sale period beginning june  we classified this portion of our ars portfolio as a non current security 
this treatment has resulted in a significant decrease to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as well as our working capital 
despite these decreases  
table of contents we believe that participation in this offering allows us further liquidity and access to available cash which enhances our operating position especially during the current period of economic uncertainty 
we hold our cash  cash equivalents and investments primarily in the united states  switzerland  and singapore 
as of december   we held an aggregate of approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and investments in the united states and an aggregate of million in foreign accounts 
funds in foreign accounts are primarily generated from revenue outside north america and are used to fund oversea operations 
we expect cash provided by operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including timing of our billings and collections  our operating results  the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions 
fiscal cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year  of million was primarily comprised of net income  net of non cash related expenses 
the primary working capital source of cash was an increase in deferred revenue due primarily to continued increase in maintenance and support obligations

thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may find it necessary to sell additional equity  or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  including the acquisition of the minority interest in our owned subsidiary in japan  or complementary products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies

this review may include assumptions regarding projected future cash flows and discount rates 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the company s conclusion as to whether it is necessary to record a liability 
as of december   the company concluded that it was not necessary to record a liability 
the company consolidated of the operating results of actuate japan and all investments in the subsidiary are eliminated in consolidation 
as of the date of this filing  the remaining minority shareholder has not notified the company of any intent to exercise its put option 
indemnification 
in the normal course of business  we provide customers with indemnification provisions of varying scope against claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of credit risk  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange risk 
during fiscal years  and we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
we face exposure to market risk on the related receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains and losses may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations were approximately million in fiscal year compared to losses of approximately  during fiscal year and gains of approximately  in fiscal year interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we typically invest in high quality debt securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on variable rate debt under our revolving credit facility 
we have drawn million on the million credit facility as of december  and expect to pay approximately million in interest annually through fiscal year the interest may increase significantly if we decide to draw on the remaining million balance under this arrangement 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on the outstanding portion of our debt obligation as of december  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in annual interest expense that would result from an immediate increase decrease in interest rates 
the analysis is shown as of december  change in interest expense in thousands credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments in investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified by geography and no single customer has accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue on an annual basis 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments portfolio includes ars 
prior to february  these securities historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer 
interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period 
at the end of fiscal  all of the long term ars we held were aaa aaa rated with most collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
until fiscal  the auction rate securities market was highly liquid 
during fiscal year  a substantial number of auctions failed  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue of the securities that holders desired to sell at auction 
the immediate effect of a failed auction is that certain holders cannot sell the securities at auction and the interest or dividend rate on the security generally resets to a maximum auction rate 
in the case of 
table of contents a failed auction  with respect to the ars held by us  the ars is deemed not currently liquid 
in the case of funds invested by us in ars which are the subject of a failed auction  we may not be able to access the funds prior to maturity without a loss of principal  unless a future auction on these investments is successful or the issuer calls the security pursuant to a mandatory tender or redemption 
in november  we elected to participate in a rights offering by ubs  our investment broker  which provides us with rights the put option to sell ubs million of our ars portfolio at par value  at any time during a two year sale period beginning june  by electing to participate in the rights offering  we granted ubs the right  exercisable at any time prior to june  or during the two year sale period  to purchase or cause the sale of our ars the call right 
ubs has stated that it will only exercise the call right for the purpose of restructurings  dispositions or other solutions that will provide their clients with par value for their ars 
ubs has agreed to pay their clients the par value of their ars within one day of settlement of any call right transaction 
notwithstanding the call right  we are permitted to sell ars to parties other than ubs  in which case the put option attached to the ars that are sold would be extinguished 
we classified the put option as a non current security 
as such  we recorded a net realized loss of approximately  related to the difference between the gain recognized on the put option and the realized loss on the million par value portion of our ars portfolio 
additional information regarding our investment portfolio is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we do not believe that future market equity or interest rate risks related to our marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on our results of operations
