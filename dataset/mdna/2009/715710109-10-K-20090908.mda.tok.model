executive overview our business pervasive software is a global software and services company focused on helping companies get the most out of their data investments through embeddable data management and agile integration software 
our embeddable pervasive psql database engine allows organizations to successfully embrace new technologies while maintaining application compatibility and robust database reliability in a near zero database administration environment 
our agile  multi purpose pervasive data integrator integration platform accelerates the sharing of information between multiple databases  applications  or hosted business systems and allows customers to re use the same software for diverse integration scenarios 
our psql database products continued to generate approximately two thirds of our revenue during fiscal year and channel adoption trends for version of our pervasive psql database have been good since its launch in september  and in june we released pervasive psql summit v  which is microsoft certified for windows server our integration products continued to generate the remaining one third of our revenue 
these products and services continue to be well received by our existing and new customers  including end users and commercial software developers alike 
our solid results in both of our core product lines allow us to continue to fund our commitment to innovation 
we will continue to invest in innovation by allocating dedicated funds for research focused on new ways to serve our existing customers and attract new customers 
our innovation efforts in fiscal year and have resulted in the introduction and further development of two new product and service offerings pervasive datasolutions subscription based integration as a service delivered on premises or as a multi tenant service hosted by pervasive and potentially by our isv customers  and 
table of contents pervasive datarush our high performance software platform for scalable data intensive data services and analytics  designed to capture the parallel processing capabilities of multi core technologies 
for more than two decades  pervasive products have delivered value with a compelling combination of performance  flexibility  reliability and low total cost of ownership 
in addition  significant portions of our database and integration flagship product lines are embeddable into commercial applications for sale predominantly to small to mid sized enterprises smes through a well developed channel of independent software vendors isvs  software as a service saas vendors  value added resellers vars and system integrators 
on july   the company completed the purchase of assets from greenville  sc based channelinx  inc for total consideration of approximately million in cash 
the channelinx business generated approximately million unaudited in revenue over the twelve months ended june  and includes dedicated software professionals 
the former channelinx team will operate as pervasive business xchange 
we develop  market  sell and support our offerings worldwide through our principal office in austin  texas and our greenville  south carolina office and through international offices in brussels  frankfurt  paris and london and a joint venture in japan 
our operating results our comparative results for the fiscal year ended june  revenue was million and million in the fiscal year ending june  and  respectively 
the company closed one relatively large transaction with a database customer representing approximately million in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal year net income was million and million in the fiscal year ending june  and  respectively 
net income in the fiscal year included an increase in revenue of million  an increase in operating expense of million  reduced interest income of million  and an increase in our income tax provision of million for a combined net increase in net income of million for fiscal year operating income  a financial measure before interest income and taxes  was million and million in the fiscal year ending june  and  respectively 
we continued to generate positive cash flow from operations with and million in the fiscal year ending june  and  respectively 
we ended fiscal year with million in cash and marketable securities 
we acquired approximately million shares of our common stock  at a cost of approximately million in the fiscal year ending june  issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of june  totaled approximately million 
market trends over the past years  businesses of all sizes have invested billions of dollars in application software that enabled them to automate and simplify their business processes 
as the sales and implementation of these application packages proliferated  including increasingly heterogeneous environments that use both saas and on premises software  organizations have faced increasing data and application infrastructure challenges and an entire software market segment emerged to address these challenges 
the past growth of the infrastructure software market in the united states  we believe  can primarily be traced to the demand for technologies that extend the use of established systems  enable the rapid deployment of new applications  and improve the ability to collaborate and communicate with customers and suppliers 

table of contents at the same time  we believe that the software markets as a whole are going through rapid change 
the emergence of cloud based infrastructure and applications is testament to the increasing demand for the scalability and rapid deployment provided by the saas delivery model 
in this environment  having a value orientation delivering flexibility and performance with the lowest tco becomes increasingly critical 
we believe infrastructure software will be a key ingredient for all businesses as they seek to integrate and streamline their back end systems and eliminate delays in the management and execution of critical processes 
infrastructure software includes  among other things  application development tools  integration tools and solutions  business intelligence  database  and security solutions 
we believe that these trends will favor pervasive 
we believe the market for data infrastructure software  in particular  is experiencing significant market disruption due to the high cost of many competing  more labor intensive solutions 
we further believe well established value leaders tend to prevail in cost sensitive markets  and pervasive  with its strengths in scalable data management and integration solutions  is well positioned to benefit from the trends in these markets 
in addition  the ability to deliver preconfigured packaged integration solutions offers the opportunity to attract non technical users and address unmet market needs 
while the economic slowdown in the us continues  we believe our value orientation and reputation as an established vendor with highly reliable offerings positions pervasive to continue to prosper 
risks to our success risks and uncertainties include  among others  our ability to attract and retain existing and or new customers  our ability to issue new products or releases of solutions that meet customers needs or achieve acceptance by the company s customers  changes to current accounting policies which may have a significant  adverse impact upon the company s financial results  the introduction of new products by competitors or the entry of new competitors  our ability to preserve our key strategic relationships  our ability to hire and retain key employees  and economic and political conditions in the us and abroad 
all of these factors  as well as those discussed in item a risk factors  may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and or our ability to sustain or increase our profitability 
going forward in  the company is focused on the continued marketing of our embedded database product  pervasive psql summit v  and development of our next version release  pervasive psql  scheduled for release in the second half of calendar growing the sales of our integration product line both through direct sales and through highly leverageable indirect channels  continuing the investment in new product and service innovation  including the further advancement of our innovation initiatives from fiscal pervasive datasolutions to take advantage of market trends in integration as a service and other on demand data solutions and pervasive datarush to serve revolutionary next generation data intensive data services and analytics by capturing the parallel processing capabilities of proliferating multi core technologies 
growing the pervasive business xchange web based electronic data interchange business and customer base  and  the continued focus on generating profitable results and positive cash flows  while we look for opportunities to reduce our issued and outstanding shares  putting to work our approved share repurchase program 
we remain committed to a strategic balance of investment in both our flagship and emerging products while also maintaining an intense focus on operating profitability 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales returns and bad debt reserves goodwill and other intangible assets stock based compensation expense taxes revenue recognition we license our software through oem license agreements with software developers  or isvs and through shrink wrap software licenses  sold through isvs  vars  systems integrators and distributors  or direct to end users 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
revenues related to oem license agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
per copy royalties related to oem license agreements in excess of a fixed minimum amount are recognized as revenue when such amounts are reported to us 
revenue from post contract support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades is recognized ratably over the contract term 
we generally provide telephone support to customers and end users in the days immediately following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call 
we accrue the cost of providing this support 
revenue from consulting services and training is recognized when the related services are performed 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return product in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
revenue from shipping and handling is recognized at the shipping date 
shipping and handling costs are included in costs of product license revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
sales returns and bad debt reserves we reserve the cost of estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights as well as uncollectible accounts based on experience 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns  stock rotation and price protection 
because these reserves are based on our judgments and estimates  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we assess whether goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are impaired on an annual basis and review for triggering events on an ongoing basis 
upon determining the existence of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles impairment  we measure impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties in an orderly transaction between market participants 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstance that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles has been impaired 
stock based compensation expense we account for employee share based compensation costs  to include stock options and restricted stock  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock option compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical volatility was used in estimating the fair value of our share based awards rather than implied volatility  while the expected life was estimated to be four years based on historical trends since our initial public offering 
further  as required under sfas r  we now estimate forfeitures for options granted  which are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
the estimated fair value is charged to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options having no vesting restrictions and being fully transferable 
accordingly  our estimate of fair value may not represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially impacts our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
taxes under the liability method of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
prior to fiscal year  we had concluded that a valuation allowance was required for all periods presented to the extent that we do not anticipate the ability to utilize a portion of the deferred tax assets 
in subsequent years  we were able to determine that we expected to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in excess of the net recorded amount  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
additionally  the valuation allowance was reduced by canada net operating loss carryforwards that expired prior to utilization and were previously offset by a valuation allowance 
state tax credit carryforwards are subject to potential expiration if not utilized by certain dates in the future 
the valuation allowance remaining at june  relates entirely to estimated expiration of state tax credit carryforwards prior to utilization 
on july  the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the company did not have an adjustment to report in conjunction with the adoption of fin 
table of contents we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are frequently under audit by tax authorities in various jurisdictions 
prior to july   accruals for tax contingencies were provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter  which matters result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing 
although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain  therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
due to the complexity involved  we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by certain lines in our consolidated statements of income 
year ended june  revenues product licenses services and others total revenues costs and expenses cost of product licenses cost of services and other sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income interest and other income  net income tax benefit provision net income revenues revenue from our embedded database product  pervasive psql  increased in fiscal year relative to fiscal year and increased in fiscal year relative to fiscal year we believe the current year increase was primarily due to a number of relatively large transactions with database customers and an increase in our professional services revenue 
the prior year increase was due to the release of our latest version of pervasive psql version our embedded database and related products represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year in addition  we believe the integration products we acquired in fiscal year as a 
table of contents result of our acquisition of data junction corporation represent a growth opportunity as we invest in opportunities presented by the acquired business and related innovative initiatives 
our integration products represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year a reduction in our embedded database business  or our inability to grow our integration products business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we generated total revenue of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to  and an increase of from fiscal to our product license revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to  and an increase of from fiscal to our service and other revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to  and an increase of from fiscal to international revenues  consisting of all revenue from customers located outside of north america  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in international revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributed to an increase in our embedded database revenue in both europe and japan 
the increase in international revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributed to an increase in our embedded database revenue in europe  partially offset by a decrease in japan 
we expect international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
costs and expenses cost of product licenses 
cost of product licenses consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for our shrink wrap software products  payment of license fees for third party technologies embedded in our products and amortization of purchased technology 
cost of product licenses was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues respectively 
the decrease in cost of product licenses revenue in fiscal year is primarily the result of the completion of the amortization of purchased technology associated with the acquisition of data junction during the second quarter of fiscal year we anticipate that cost of product licenses revenue in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year due to the amortization of purchased technology relating to our recent acquisition of the assets of channelinx on july  the channelinx acquisition 
cost of services and other 
cost of services and other consists primarily of the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support  which is typically provided within days of purchase  and the costs to deliver professional services and training services to others 
cost of services and other was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we anticipate cost of services and other in fiscal year will increase as a result of our recent channelinx acquisition 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in costs related to sales and marketing personnel and increased investment in marketing programs in support of new and upgraded product releases 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in costs related to sales and marketing personnel and increased investment in marketing programs in support of new product releases and our efforts around our innovation products 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses will increase during fiscal year as we increase our sales and marketing personnel and invest in marketing programs in support of our new products and services as well as our recent channelinx acquisition 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to increased investment in innovation of extensions to existing products as well as new products and services 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to increased investment in innovation of extensions to existing products as well as new products and services 
we anticipate our research and development spending will increase in fiscal year as a result of our recent channelinx acquisition 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel salaries and other costs of our finance  human resources and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal year  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar amount in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in legal expenses and an increase in our bad debt expense 
we believe our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year share based compensation expense 
share based compensation expense reflects non cash compensation expense associated with restricted stock purchase rights and employee stock options accounted for under sfas r 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation expense was included in costs and expenses as follows amounts in thousands cost of service and other revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total the decrease in share based compensation expenses in resulted primarily from reductions in senior management positions in the decrease in share based compensation expenses in resulted primarily from changes in the mix of the types of awards granted and the number of awards granted 
we believe our share based compensation expense in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year interest and other income 
interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on various investments and was approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal and is primarily the result of lower yields on invested funds and investing a portion of our investments in tax advantaged instruments 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes related to operations was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal years  and consist of income taxes related to both our foreign and domestic operations  offset by a change in our valuation allowance 

table of contents quarterly results from operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  and we believe all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below

table of contents our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
we establish our expenditure levels based on expectations as to future revenue  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
as a result  a drop in near term demand for our products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
in the future  our operating results may fluctuate for this reason or as a result of a number of other factors  including increased expenses  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of sales  announcements of new products by us or our competitors and capital spending patterns of our customers 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
see risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal year as our trade receivables remained at normalized levels compared to revenues following significant collections experience in fiscal and our income tax expenses increasingly resulted in cash payments to taxing jurisdictions 
cash provided by operations decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of an increase in our trade receivables 
we invested  net  million and million in marketable securities in fiscal and  respectively 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale or maturity of marketable securities in fiscal in addition  we purchased property and equipment totaling approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this property consisted primarily of computer hardware and software for general upgrade requirements for all fiscal years 
during fiscal years  and  we repurchased approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  of common stock at a cost of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in march  we announced the authorization of a new million stock repurchase plan which became effective on march   of which million remains available as of june  depending on market conditions and other factors  such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice 
during fiscal years ended june   and  we received approximately million  million and million  respectively  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options resulting in the issuance of shares of our common stock of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ending june   and  respectively 
we are exploring new opportunities to build  license or acquire products and services for introduction to and through our expansive worldwide channel 
any such transaction could cause us to issue dilutive equity securities  reduce our cash and marketable securities  or incur debt or contingent liabilities

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fsp fas on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position fsp fas  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  to provide additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased 
the fsp also

the fsp emphasizes that  regardless of whether the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have decreased significantly and regardless of which valuation technique was used  the objective of a fair value measurement under fasb statement  fair value measurements  remains the same to estimate the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the fsp also requires expanded disclosures

we are not aware of any subsequent events which would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in belgium  germany  france and england and a joint venture in japan  and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in operating income of approximately million 
the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of all other currencies for fiscal  and was not material 

table of contents we monitor our foreign currency exposure and  from time to time  will attempt to reduce exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended june    and as such hedging activities were minimal 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as our investment policy requires us to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
