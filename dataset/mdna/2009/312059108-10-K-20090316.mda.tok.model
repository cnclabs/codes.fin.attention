critical accounting policies general 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 

table of contents a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in our estimates 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable accounting method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact the company s transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on three basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance and iii sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  which requires adequate documentation to support the allowance for loan losses estimate 
the company s allowance for loan losses has two basic components the specific allowance and the general allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for larger balance  non homogeneous loans 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
first  analysis of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  the prospects for support from financial guarantors  and the fair market value of collateral are used to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
then the migration of historical default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  industry and market conditions and trends  and other environmental factors are considered 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the general allowance is used for estimating the loss on pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans  including family mortgage loans  installment loans  other consumer loans  and outstanding loan commitments 
also  the general allowance is used for the remaining pool of larger balance  non homogeneous loans which were not allocated a specific allowance upon their review 
the general allowance begins with estimates of probable losses inherent in the homogeneous portfolio based upon various statistical analyses 
these include analysis of historical and peer group delinquency and credit loss experience  together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions 
the company also considers trends and changes in the volume and term of loans  changes in the credit process and or lending policies and procedures  and an evaluation of overall credit quality 
the general allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses 
as a result  even though this history is regularly updated with the most recent loss information  it could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the general allowance also captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in the specific allowances 
executive overview this discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding the company and the bank and may not contain all the information that is important to the reader 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of our financial statements 
as such  this discussion should be read carefully in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere in this report 
the bank is the primary independent community bank in its immediate market area as measured by deposit market share 
it seeks to be the primary financial service provider for its market area by providing the right mix of consistently high quality customer service  efficient technological support  value added products  and a strong commitment to the community 
net income of million in was a decrease from net income of million 
the company and the bank s primary operating businesses are in commercial and retail lending  deposit accounts and core deposits  and assets under wms management 
loans  net of reserve  increased in compared with a decline of in and growth of   and of net loans in   and  respectively 

table of contents deposits decreased in compared with a decrease of in  an increase of in  and an increase of from year end to year end the market value of assets under wms management decreased from to  but increased and  respectively  from to and from to the changes in assets under wms management reflect  in large part  the changes in the overall us and international bond and stock markets 
net interest income is the largest component of net income  and equals the difference between income generated on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
future trends regarding net interest income are dependent on the absolute level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the amount of lost income from non performing assets  the amount of prepaying loans  the mix and amount of various deposit types  and many other factors  as well as the overall volume of interest earning assets 
these factors are individually difficult to predict  and when taken together  the uncertainty of future trends compounds 
based on management s current projections  net interest income may increase in and beyond as average interest earning assets increase  but this may be offset in part or in whole by a possible contraction in the bank s net interest margin resulting from competitive market conditions and a flat or inverted yield curve 
a steeper yield curve is projected to result in an increase in net interest income  while a flatter or inverted yield curve is projected to result in a decrease in net interest income 
the specific nature of the bank s variability in net interest income due to changes in interest rates  also known as interest rate risk  is to a large degree the result of the bank s deposit base structure 
during  demand deposits  now  and savings deposits averaged   and of total average deposits  respectively  while the more interest rate sensitive premium money market accounts  money market accounts  and certificates of deposit averaged  and of total average deposits  respectively

the bank is looking toward these new retail markets for growth in deposits and wms income 
management seeks to increase the level of its fee income from deposits and wms through the increase of its market share within its marketplace

the average rate on total interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in compared with net interest income decreased  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income was due to the company s net interest margin decreasing from in to in  primarily due to the flat and inverted yield curve through the first three quarters of  as well as competitive pricing 
partially offsetting the impact of the declining net interest margin was the relatively small impact of total average earning assets increasing from million in to million in the percentage of average earning assets to total assets increased in to from in the net interest margin pressure caused by the economic environment of a flat and inverted yield curve proved to be challenging for the bank during much of at june   just as the federal open market committee the fed began raising the federal funds rate  the yield on a three month maturity treasury bond was or basis points below the yield on a five year treasury and basis points below the yield on a year treasury 
at october   that yield had inverted to the point that a three month treasury was yielding  while the five year and ten year treasury were yielding and  respectively 
the yield curve changed from a more than basis point premium for a longer investment to a position where there is no premium or  in fact  a discount 
this presented funding and interest margin management pressures  as a flat or inverted yield curve significantly increased competition for deposits and their cost 
while deposit costs rapidly increased  the lack of a similar movement in longer term rates limited the yield increase on fixed rate loans 
during the fourth quarter of  the fed began lowering the federal funds rate  and the shape of the yield curve became less flat and more positively sloped 
as a result  the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of improved to as compared to for the fourth quarter of

provision for loan losses  allowance for loan losses  and asset quality the provision for loan losses was million for   for  and  for the amount of the provision for loan loss for   and was based upon management s continual evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which encompasses the overall risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  trends in the bank s delinquent and non performing loans  estimated values of collateral  and the impact of economic conditions on borrowers 
greater weight is given to the loss history by loan category  prolonged changes in portfolio delinquency trends by loan category  and changes in economic trends 
there can be no assurances  however  that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts  or that increased amounts of provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
the increase in the provision for loan losses during was largely in response to the increase in non performing assets and net loan chargeoffs in  as well as the impact of a slowing economy  declining real estate values  and continued growth in new loan originations during and the increase in the provision for loan 
table of contents losses from to was largely in response to the increase in net loan chargeoffs 
loan chargeoffs  net of recoveries  totaled million for  million for  and  for loan portfolio at december    and  net loans accounted for   and of total assets  respectively  and were the largest category of the company s earning assets 
loans are shown on the balance sheets net of unearned discounts and the allowance for loan losses 
interest is computed by methods that result in level rates of return on principal 
loans are charged off when deemed by management to be uncollectible  after taking into consideration such factors as the current financial condition of the customer and the underlying collateral and guarantees 
the company has adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
fasb statement no 
 as amended  requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation is to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral 
fasb statement no 
 as amended  also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  financial condition of the borrower  and the current economic conditions 
a performing loan may be considered impaired if the factors above indicate a need for impairment 
a loan on non accrual status may not be impaired if it is in the process of collection or if the shortfall in payment is insignificant 
a delay of less than days or a shortfall of less than of the required principal and interest payments generally is considered insignificant and would not indicate an impairment situation  if in management s judgment the loan will be paid in full 
loans that meet the regulatory definitions of doubtful or loss generally qualify as impaired loans under fasb statement no 
as is the case for all loans  charge offs for impaired loans occur when the loan or portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectible 
the bank considers all consumer installment loans and residential mortgage loans to be homogenous loans 
these loans are not subject to individual impairment under fasb statement no 
asset quality non performing assets  in most cases  consist of loans that are days or more past due and for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
management evaluates all loans that are days or more past due  as well as borrowers that have suffered financial distress  to determine if they should be placed on non accrual status 
factors considered by management include the net realizable value of collateral  if any  and other resources of the borrower that may be available to satisfy the delinquency 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they have been specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent for days or more  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed from income 
interest income generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
interest payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
interest income on other non accrual loans is recognized only to the extent of interest payments received 
non performing assets totaled million or of total loans and other real estate owned at december   as compared with million or of total loans at december  and million  or of total loans at december  non performing assets as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses were  and at december   and  respectively 
the number of non performing loan 
table of contents relationships increased from seventeen at december  to thirty two at december   but decreased to nineteen at december  the reduction in the number of non performing loan relationships from the end of to the end of was primarily due to the reduction in non performing consumer loans  primarily auto loans  over that same time period 
the bank s other real estate owned consists of two properties with a total value  net of cost to sell  of  at december  compared with none at december  and the first property has a net value of approximately million and consists of acres of undeveloped land in opal  virginia 
the second property has a net value of approximately million and consists of a  square foot office condominium located in warrenton  virginia 
loans that were days past due and accruing interest totaled   and  at december    and  respectively 
no loss is anticipated on any loan days past due and accruing interest 
of the loans days past due and accruing at december   both were subsequently brought current as of january  additionally  there were four loan relationships totaling  that were accruing interest at december   but which were considered impaired and were allocated specific loan loss reserves 
there are no loans  other than those disclosed above as either non performing or impaired  where information known about the borrower has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to repay 
at december   there are no other interest bearing assets that would be subject to disclosure as either non performing or impaired 
at december   no concentration of loans to commercial borrowers engaged in similar activities exceeded of total loans 
the largest industry concentrations at december  were approximately of loans to the hospitality industry hotels  motels  inns  etc for more information regarding the bank s concentration of loans collateralized by real estate  please refer to the discussion under risk factors in item a of this report entitled we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate and a downturn in the real estate market  for any reason  may increase our credit losses  which would negatively affect our financial results 
based on recently enacted regulatory guidelines  the bank is now required to monitor the commercial investment real estate loan portfolio for a concentrations above of tier capital and loan loss reserve for construction and land loans and b for permanent investor real estate loans 
as of december   construction and land loans are million or of the concentration limit  while permanent investor real estate loans by naics code are million or of the concentration level

analysis of loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  credit concentration  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans  and current economic conditions 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio to determine probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on net realizable values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
changes in the allowances relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance remains subject to change 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  recorded as the provision for loan losses on the company s statements of income  are made monthly to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged off or recovered during a given period and current national and local economic conditions 
at december      and  the allowance for loan losses was     and  respectively

the proceeds of the sale were redeployed into securities with an average assumed life of approximately five years 
management seeks to increase the level of its future fee income from wealth management services and deposits through the increase of its market share within its marketplace 
wealth management fees are projected to continue to grow at a pace closer to the growth seen in  rather than the growth seen in and the decline in this assumes that the market value of the us and international stock markets increases

defined benefit pension plan expenses are projected to be approximately  during and k expenses are projected to increase approximately  in growth in k after is projected to increase approximately at the same rate of increase as salaries 

table of contents the bank expects personnel costs  consisting primarily of salary and benefits  to continue to be its largest non interest expense 
as such  the most important factor with regard to potential changes in other expenses is the expansion of staff 
the cost of any additional staff expansion  however  would be expected to be offset by the increased revenue generated by the additional services that the new staff would enable the bank to perform 
during  the company projects the increase of approximately full time equivalent people

the primary sources of funds are deposits  repayment of loans  maturities of investments  funds provided from operations and advances from the fhlb of atlanta 
while scheduled repayments of loans and maturities of investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan repayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank uses its sources of funds to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  to maintain liquidity  and to meet operating expenses 
management monitors projected liquidity needs and determines the desirable funding level based in part on the bank s commitments to make loans and management s assessment of the bank s ability to generate funds 
management is not aware of any market or institutional trends  events or uncertainties that are expected to have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of the company or the bank 
nor is management aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have a material effect on liquidity  capital resources or operations 
the bank s internal sources of such liquidity are deposits  loan and investment repayments  and securities available for sale 
the bank s primary external source of liquidity is advances from the fhlb of atlanta 

table of contents cash and amounts due from depository institutions  interest bearing deposits in other banks  and federal funds sold totaled million at december  compared with million at december  these assets provide a primary source of liquidity for the bank

capital the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined in the regulations  and of tier i capital to average assets as defined in the regulations 
management believes  as of december   that the company and the bank more than satisfy all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of the company and the bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than inflation does 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk an important component of both earnings performance and liquidity is management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income and economic value of equity from a change in market interest rates 
the bank is subject to interest rate sensitivity to the degree that its interest earning assets mature or reprice at different time intervals than its interest bearing liabilities 
however  the bank is not subject to the other major categories of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
the bank uses a number of tools to manage its interest rate risk  including simulating net interest income under various scenarios  monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios  and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling 
the earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value equity under varying market rate assumptions 
the bank monitors exposure to instantaneous changes in rates of up to basis points up or down over a rolling month period 
the bank s policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net interest income and change in equity from instantaneous changes in interest rates of basis points over months is and  respectively 
management has maintained a risk position well within these guideline levels during
