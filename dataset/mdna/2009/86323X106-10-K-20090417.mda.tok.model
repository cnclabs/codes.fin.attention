item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations backlog  for an explanation of the current year backlog compared with the prior year backlog 
streamline health enters into master agreements with its customers to specify the scope of the system to be installed and or services to be provided by streamline health  the agreed upon aggregate price and the timetable for implementation 
the master agreement typically provides that streamline health will deliver the system in phases  thereby allowing the customer flexibility in the timing of its receipt of systems and to make adjustments that may arise based upon changes in technology or changes in customer needs 
the master agreement also allows the customer to request additional components as the installation progresses  which additions are then separately negotiated as to price and terms 
historically  customers have ultimately purchased systems and services in addition to those originally contemplated by the master agreement  although there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
at january   streamline health has master agreements and purchase orders from remarketing partners for systems and related services excluding support and maintenance  and transaction based revenues for the application hosting services that have not been delivered  and or installed which  if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  the related solutions and services are expected to be delivered over the next two to three years 
furthermore  streamline health has entered into application hosting agreements  which are expected to generate revenues in excess of  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years through streamline health s master agreements also generally provide for a limited initial maintenance period and require the customer to subscribe for maintenance and support services on a monthly  quarterly  or annual basis 
maintenance and support revenues for fiscal years   and were approximately   and  respectively 
maintenance and support revenues are expected to increase in the future 
at january   streamline health had maintenance agreements and purchase orders from remarketing partners for maintenance  which if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal year the commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system  the implementation schedule requested by the customer and usage by customers of the application hosting services 
therefore  streamline health is unable to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period 
streamline health s master agreements generally provide that the customer may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by streamline health  or may delay certain aspects of the installation 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of streamline health to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on streamline health s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
royalties and license fees streamline health incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate streamline health s proprietary software 
streamline health licenses these software products  and pays the required royalties and or license fees when such software is delivered to streamline health s customers 

table of contents employees as of january   streamline health had full time employees  a decrease of during the fiscal year as a result of a company wide reorganization plan put in place in the third quarter of in an effort to reduce costs and improve cash flow to align with its emphasis on the saas based hosting model 
in addition  streamline health utilizes independent contractors to supplement its staff  as needed 
none of streamline health s employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
streamline health has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good

item a risk factors see also  part i  item  business 
the following is a list of risk factors that affect the company 
they are not listed in any particular order or relative importance and no inferences should be given to the listing order 
in addition  risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company  its financial condition and or operating results 
the variability of the company s quarterly operating results can be significant 
the company s operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past  and the company expects continued fluctuations in the future 
future revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these factors include the relatively large size of customer agreements  unpredictability in the number and timing of system sales and sales of applications hosting services  length of the sales cycle  delays in installations  changes in customers financial condition or budgets  increased competition  the development and introduction of new products and services  the loss of significant customers or remarketing partners  changes in government regulations  particularly as to the healthcare industry  the size and growth of the overall healthcare information technology markets  any liability and other claims that may be asserted against the company  the company s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  national and local general economic and market conditions  and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this form k and any other filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s sales have been concentrated in a small number of customers 
the company s revenues have been concentrated in a relatively small number of large customers  and the company has historically derived a substantial percentage of its total revenues from a few customers 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of streamline health to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on streamline health s business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents sales to the company s largest application hosting client ceased at the end of july the company s largest application hosting client did not renew its hosting agreement at the end of july  which resulted in lower application hosting services revenues for the company s fiscal year 
although this client had renewed its hosting agreement with the company several times over the previous five and a half year period  this client built its own locally installed solution 
if the company is unable to replace the revenue stream from this client  which had been approximately million annually  the termination of this agreement will have a material adverse effect on the company 
although the company signed eight new additional application hosting services agreements in  which revenues have not yet fully come on line  those new contracts are expected to generate revenues estimated to be approximately only of the revenues attributable to the loss of this single large customer 
the company needs to continue to expand its customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future 
in addition to direct sales  the company relies on third party remarketing alliances for a substantial portion of its revenues 
the company seeks to expand its distribution channels by creating remarketing alliances with third parties who are engaged in the sale of healthcare information systems  medical records management and outsourcing  and other healthcare information technology and patient care solutions 
ge healthcare  the company s major remarketing partner  could choose to discontinue reselling streamline health products  and significant customers could elect to discontinue using the company s products 
the company needs to ensure that it expands its distribution channels to reduce the reliance on a single major reseller 
the company could be less profitable than expected 
because of the relatively fixed operating expenses and overhead  the future profitability of the company is dependent on increasing revenues which may not materialize as anticipated 
because of the company s anticipated shift in strategic focus towards remote application hosting services software as a service saas  upon obtaining new application hosting customers  the company will have to expend a significant amount of costs and time before those new customers are able to begin using such services and the company cannot begin to recognize revenues from those clients until the commencement of such services 
accordingly  the company anticipates that its near term cash flow  revenue and profitability may be adversely affected by this shift in strategic focus until new hosting customers go into production 
while the company anticipates long term growth through increases in recurring subscription fees and significantly improved profit visibility  the company s failure to successfully implement its focus on building its application hosting services business  or the failure of such initiative to result in improved profitability  could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
the company needs to manage its costs while planning for growth 
the company is currently experiencing a period of growth primarily through its remote application hosting line of business and this could continue to place a significant strain on the company s cash flow 
this could also strain the services and support operations  sales and administrative personnel and other resources as they are requested to handle the added work load with existing support resources 
streamline health believes that it must continue to focus on these remote hosting services  develop new products  enhance existing solutions and serve the needs of its existing and anticipated customer base 
the company s ability to successfully maintain and expand its operations will depend  in large part  upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees 
the company s ability to manage its planned growth effectively also will require the company to continue to improve its operational  management  and financial systems and controls  to train  motivate  and manage its employees and to judiciously manage its operating expenses in anticipation of increased future revenues 

table of contents the potential impact on the company of new or changes in existing federal  state  and local regulations governing healthcare information could be substantial 
healthcare regulations issued to date have not had a material adverse affect on the company s business 
however  the company cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently existing regulations and which could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate patient health information 
streamline health believes that the features and architecture of its existing solutions are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations  but there can be no assurances 
while new laws and regulations may increase the demand for healthcare information technology  including the solutions offered by the company  such laws and regulations may have adverse consequences on the company 
legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the federal and state level including  but not limited to  the healthcare initiatives set forth in the american recovery and reinvestment act of the stimulus bill signed into law by president obama on february  notwithstanding that the stimulus bill places substantial emphasis on the modernization of the us healthcare system by using healthcare information technology  with a primary focus on electronic medical records  the company s ability to benefit from such initiatives is uncertain at this time 
the implementation of the provisions in the stimulus bill may create new requirements for healthcare information technology that would require the company to incur additional research and development expenditures to modify or expand its solutions in order to be fully compliant 
in addition  until it becomes more clear how the government will apply its anticipated substantial funding of these healthcare initiatives  hospitals and other healthcare providers may delay purchases of new solutions until additional details become known 
in such event  the company may experience delays in entering into new agreements with existing customers and potential new customers 
the substantial sums of money contemplated by the stimulus bill to be spent on healthcare information technology further may increase competition by attracting new and financially stronger entities to this industry 
streamline health faces significant competition  including from companies with significantly greater resources 
the company currently competes with many other companies for the licensing of similar software solutions and related services 
several companies historically have dominated the clinical information systems software market and several of these companies have either acquired  developed or are developing their own document management and workflow technologies 
the industry is undergoing consolidation and realignment as companies position themselves to compete more effectively 
many of these companies are larger than streamline health and have significantly more resources to invest in their business 
in addition  information and document management companies serving other industries may enter the market 
suppliers and companies with whom streamline health may establish strategic alliances may also compete with streamline health 
such companies and vendors may either individually  or by forming alliances excluding streamline health  place bids for large agreements in competition with streamline health 
a decision on the part of any of these competitors to focus additional resources in the image enabling  workflow  and other markets addressed by streamline health could have a material adverse effect on streamline health 
the healthcare industry is evolving rapidly  which may make it more difficult for the company to be competitive in the future 
the us healthcare system is under intense pressure to improve in many areas  including modernization  universal access and controlling skyrocketing costs of care 
streamline health believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are customer recommendations and references  company reputation  system reliability  system features and functionality including ease of use  technological advancements  customer service and support  breadth and quality of the systems  the potential for enhancements and future compatible products  the 
table of contents effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts  price and the size and perceived financial stability of the vendor 
in addition  the company believes that the speed with which companies in its market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that streamline health will be able to keep pace with changing conditions and new developments such that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors 
rapid technology changes and short product life cycles could harm streamline health s business 
the market for streamline health s solutions and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  regulatory requirements  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing solutions obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  streamline health s position in the healthcare information technology market could change rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
streamline health s future success will depend  in part  upon streamline health s ability to enhance its existing solutions and services and to develop and introduce new solutions and services to meet changing requirements 
the company needs to maintain an ongoing research and development program to continue to develop new solutions and apply new technologies to its existing products  but may not have sufficient funds with which to undertake such required research and development 
if the company is not able to foresee changes and or to react in a timely manner to such developments  the company may experience a material  adverse impact on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
streamline health s intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of streamline health s solutions and services 
the company trademarks and copyrights its intellectual property  which represents an important asset to the company 
streamline health does not have any patent protection on any of its software 
the company relies upon license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc 
to maintain the confidentiality of streamline health s proprietary information and trade secrets 
notwithstanding these precautions  others may copy  reverse engineer or design independently  technology similar to streamline health s products 
if the company fails to adequately protect the intellectual property through trademarks and copyrights  license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc  the intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated  or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate the company s technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technology advantage the company may have 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend streamline health s proprietary technology or to determine the validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation  could be successful or unsuccessful  may result in substantial cost and require significant attention by management and technical personnel 
due to the rapid pace of technology change  the company believes its future success is likely to depend upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of our property rights 
however  the company has in the past  and intends in the future  to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary 
the company could be subjected to claims of intellectual property infringement  which claims could be expensive to defend 
while the company does not believe that its products and services infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  the potential for intellectual property infringement claims continually increases as the number of software patents and copyrighted and trademarked materials continues to rapidly expand 
any claim for intellectual property right infringement  even if not meritorious  would be expensive to defend 
if the company were to become liable for infringing third party intellectual property rights  the company could be liable for substantial damage awards  and potentially be required to cease using the technology  to produce non infringing technology  or to obtain a license to use such technology 
such potential liabilities or increased costs could be materially adverse to the company 

table of contents the company s customers must comply with extensive regulations relating to confidentiality and  accordingly  the company s solutions must be able to assist its customers in complying with such regulations 
federal and state laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
regulations governing electronic health data privacy are continuing to evolve 
the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of  enacted august   is designed to improve the efficiency of healthcare by standardizing the interchange of specified electronic data  and to protect the security and confidentiality of protected health information 
hipaa requires that covered entities comply with national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions  and adopt policies and practices to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of phi 
streamline health cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
streamline health believes that the features and architecture of streamline health s solutions are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations 
however  if the regulations are unduly restrictive  this could cause delays in the delivery of new versions of solutions and adversely affect the licensing of streamline health s solutions 
however  there can be no assurance that an increase in the purchase of new systems or additional use of streamline health software and services will occur 
third party products are essential to streamline health s software 
streamline health software incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate some of the company s proprietary software modules 
the loss of the ability to use these third party products  or ability to obtain substitute third party software at comparable prices  could have a material adverse affect on the ability to license streamline health software 
streamline health s solutions may not be error free and could result in claims of breach of contract and liabilities 
streamline health s solutions are very complex and may not be error free  especially when first released 
although the company performs extensive testing  failure of any product to operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require streamline health to correct the deficiency 
if such deficiency is not corrected within the agreed upon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner  it could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and possibly subjecting the company to liability 
also  streamline health sometimes indemnifies its customers against third party infringement claims 
if such claims are made  even if they are without merit  they could be expensive to defend 
streamline health s license agreement generally limits the company s liability arising from claims such as described in the foregoing sentences  but such limits may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions or under some circumstances 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company could be liable to third parties from the use of the company s solutions 
the company s solutions provide access to patient information used by physicians and other medical personnel in providing medical care 
the medical care provided by physicians and other medical personnel are subject to numerous medical malpractice and other claims 
the company attempts to limit any potential liability of the company to customers by limiting the warranties on its solutions in the company s agreements with the company s customer  the healthcare provider 
however  such agreements do not protect the company from third party claims by patients who may seek damages from any or all persons or entities connected to the process of delivering patient care 
the company maintains insurance  which provides limited protection from such claims  if such claims against the company would result in liability to the company 
although no such claims have been brought against the company to date regarding injuries related to the use of our solutions  such claims may be made 
table of contents in the future 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company s remote application hosting services and support services could experience interruptions 
the company provides remote hosting services for many clients  including the storage of critical patient  financial and administrative data 
in addition  it provides support services to clients through the client support facility 
the company has redundancies  such as backup generators  redundant telecommunications lines  and backup facilities built into its operations to prevent disruptions 
however  complete failure of all generators or impairment of all telecommunications lines or severe casualty damage to the primary building or equipment inside the primary building housing our hosting center or client support facilities could cause a temporary disruption in operations and adversely affect clients who depend on the application hosting services 
any interruption in operations at its data center or client support facility could cause the company to lose existing clients  impede our ability to obtain new clients  result in revenue loss  cause potential liability to our clients  and increase our operating costs 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect streamline health s business 
streamline health s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management  sales force and technical personnel 
the company must recruit  motivate  and retain highly skilled managers  sales  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants  and system architects who have the requisite expertise in the technical environments in which our solutions operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
the company s failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may not have access to sufficient capital to be competitive in its markets 
streamline health may need additional capital in the form of loans or equity in order to operate and to be competitive 
the company may be limited to the availability of such capital or may not have any availability  in which case the company s future prospects may be materially impaired 
the company must maintain compliance with the terms of its existing credit facilities 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to finance its ongoing operations and the company may not be able to find an alternative lending source if a default would occur 
on january   the company entered into a revised revolving credit facility with its existing lender 
upon doing so  the company was able to negotiate modified terms in order to cure the company s previous non compliance with the minimum tangible net worth requirement  which non compliance had been previously waived 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain compliance with all of the covenants and other terms and conditions of this credit facility on an ongoing basis 
if not  the company could be required to pay back the amounts borrowed on an accelerated basis  which could subject the company to decreased liquidity and other negative impacts on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  if the company would need to find an alternative lending source  the company may have difficulty in doing so  particularly in the current credit environment which is not favorable to borrowers 
without a sufficient credit facility  the company would be adversely affected by a lack of access to liquidity needed to operate the company s business 
any disruption in access to credit could force the company to take measures to conserve cash  such as deferring important research and development expenses  which measures could have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents if the national and global financial crisis intensifies  potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business  including the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet long term commitments  which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if internal funds are not available from operations  the company may be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet its financial commitments and short term liquidity needs 
the company s access to funds under its revolving credit facility or pursuant to arrangements with other financial institutions is dependent on the ability of the financial institution s ability to meet funding commitments 
financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience high volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time 
the current financial crisis in the united states and globally may have significant effects on the company s customers and suppliers that would result in material adverse effects on the company s business  operating results and stock price 
the current financial crisis in the united states and globally and the concern that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary period may materially adversely affect the company s customers access to capital or willingness to spend capital on the company s products and services and or their levels of cash liquidity in with which or willingness to pay for products that they will order or have already ordered from the company 
continuing adverse economic conditions would also likely negatively impact the company s business  which could result in reduced demand for the company s products and services  increased price competition for the company s products and services  increased risk of collectability of cash from the company s customers  increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable  reduced revenues  and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 
all of the foregoing potential consequences of the current financial crisis are difficult to forecast and mitigate 
as a consequence  the company s operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict  and  therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of future results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect the company s stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile 
the public trading of the company s common stock is based on many factors  which could cause fluctuation in the price of the company s common stock 
these factors may include  among other things general economic and market conditions  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  lack of research coverage by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the healthcare information technology industry  changes in the market valuations of other companies in the company s industry  announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  divestitures  joint ventures or other strategic initiatives  capital commitments  additional or departures of key personnel  and sales and repurchases of the company s common stock 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
these factors may cause the market price of the company s common stock to decline  regardless of the company s operating performance 

table of contents the preparation of the company s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements 
one of the company s most critical estimates is the capitalization of software development costs 
due to the inherent nature of these estimates  the company cannot provide absolute assurance that it will not significantly increase or decrease such estimates upon determination of the actual results 
any required adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations  and could result in the restatement of the company s prior period financial statements 
changes in accounting standards could impact the company s reported earnings and financial condition 
the accounting standard setters  including the financial accounting standards board  the us securities and exchange commission and other regulatory bodies  periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  which could result in the restatement of the company s prior period financial statements 
failure to improve and maintain the quality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide timely and accurate financial information about the company 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the company s third fiscal quarter ended october   management identified a deficiency in the internal controls over financial reporting relating to the capitalization of software development costs for the company s second fiscal quarter ended july  while such deficiency did not rise to the level of a material weakness or significant deficiency  an adjustment of approximately  was made in the third quarter to capitalize certain software development expenses that had been expensed in the second quarter 
management cannot be certain that other deficiencies will not arise in the future or be identified or that the company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating results or cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner 
these risks are not exhaustive 
other sections of this form k may include additional factors which could adversely impact the company s business and financial performance 
moreover  the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the company s management to predict all risk factors  nor can the company assess the impact of all factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results

revenues from agreements that contain multiple element arrangements are allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the elements 
revenues related to routine installation and integration and project management are deferred until the work is performed 
revenues from consulting  education  and application hosting services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from short term support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables 
under the terms of a remarketing agreement with ge healthcare  streamline health records this revenue when the solutions are made available to end users

corrective action  if necessary  is taken by streamline health to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables

if the financial condition of streamline health s customers or resellers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
streamline health s customers typically have been well established hospitals  medical facilities  or major healthcare information systems companies that resell streamline health s products  which have good credit histories  and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry

in the fourth quarter of  the company expensed approximately  for partial impairment on a specific workflow product that had been under development for the past few years 
the development efforts on this product are now temporarily on hold pending a new beta partner and final completion 
the capitalized costs relating to this product were written down to its expected net realizable value based upon the current future sales estimates 
this impairment change is reflected in the financial statements as capitalized software amortization in the cost of system sales 
this asset could be further written down if future sales do not materialize as expected 
streamline health believes that to replicate its existing software would cost significantly more than the stated net book value of  at january  over the last three years  streamline health has spent approximately  in research and development  of which  or  has been capitalized

a valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to a level which will  more likely than not  be realized 
whether the deferred tax assets will be realized depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax asset become deductible 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
as of january   streamline health believes that a valuation allowance is required to reduce a portion of the deferred tax assets  primarily relating to certain net operating loss carry forwards  for the following reasons there can be no assurance that streamline health will be able to achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or be able to sustain or increase its revenue growth in future periods and believes historical operating results may not be indicative of the future performance of streamline health in the near or long term 
streamline health has incurred net losses as indicated by the carry forwards of approximately  based on the expenses associated with current and planned staffing levels  continued profitability and utilization of carry forwards to be evaluated as more likely than not is dependent upon increasing revenues 
as of january   streamline health estimates that a valuation allowance of approximately  was required to reduce the deferred tax assets  primarily relating to loss carry forwards  to a level streamline health currently believes will be utilized to offset future earnings before income taxes based on the current backlog and forecasts over the next two years 
the valuation allowance is required due to the inability to predict on a longer term basis that streamline health will more likely than not attain levels of profitability required to utilize additional carry forwards
