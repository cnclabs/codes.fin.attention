item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations some information contained in the management s discussion and analysis is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties 
the company operates in a cyclical industry and the results achieved this year are not necessarily an indication of future prospects for the company 
actual results in future years may differ materially from the results presented below 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  fluctuations in the volume and timing of product orders  changes in demand for the company s products  changes in technology  continued competitive pressures in the marketplace  outcomes of environmental contingencies  availability of raw materials  the ability to pass on raw material price increases  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
overview the company produces and sells intermediate chemicals that are used in a wide variety of applications worldwide 
the overall business comprises three reportable segments surfactants surfactants  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales  are principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products such as detergents for washing clothes  dishes  carpets  floors and walls  as well as shampoos  body washes  toothpastes and fabric softeners 
other applications include germicidal quaternary compounds  lubricating ingredients  emulsifiers for spreading agricultural products  plastics and composites and biodiesel 
surfactants are manufactured at six north american sites five in the us and one in canada  three european sites united kingdom  france and germany and three latin american sites mexico  brazil and colombia 
the company also owns percent of a surfactant joint venture in the philippines  which is not included in consolidated results or in the surfactant segment results  as it is accounted for under the equity method 
in september  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with nalco company 
the joint venture tiorco  llc was formed to market chemical solutions for increased production of crude oil and gas from existing fields 
the company has a percent ownership interest in tiorco  llc and accounts for the venture under the equity method 
polymers polymers  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales  include three primary product lines phthalic anhydride  polyols and polyurethane systems 
phthalic anhydride is used in polyester alkyd resins and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive  boating and other consumer products 
polyols are used in the manufacture of laminate insulation board for the construction industry and are also sold to the appliance  flexible foam and coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers case markets 
polyurethane systems products are used in specialty applications like aerospace and adhesives 
in the us  polymer product lines are manufactured at the company s millsdale  illinois  site 
polyols are also manufactured at the company s wesseling cologne  germany facility  as well as at its joint venture in nanjing  china which is included in consolidated results 
during the 
table of contents second quarter of  the company raised its ownership interest in the joint venture from percent to percent 
the company also has a polymer sales office in brazil that does not include manufacturing facilities 
specialty products specialty products  which accounted for three percent of consolidated net sales  include flavors  emulsifiers and solubilizers used in the food and pharmaceutical industries 
specialty products are manufactured primarily at the company s maywood  new jersey  site 
the company has numerous competitors due to the diverse markets it serves 
competition is generally based on price  product performance and the ability to meet specific needs of customers 
in some instances  particularly in the surfactants segment  the company competes with internal manufacturing capabilities of its customers 
this situation can lead to large period to period sales volume swings when such customers decide to internally manufacture product that the company once supplied 
in addition  the company s manufacturing costs are relatively fixed in nature 
as a result  gross profit defined as net sales less cost of sales is susceptible to disproportionate declines when volume decreases 
a number of the company s key raw materials and energy sources are commodities  principally petroleum based and plant based materials and natural gas used to power the company s manufacturing facilities  whose prices fluctuate due to weather  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
in recent years  raw material costs have escalated due to increased global demand  instability in the middle east and tight supplies 
this trend continued throughout most of  and the company passed on the increased costs to customers as quickly as the marketplace allowed 
in the fourth quarter of the trend reversed  and raw material costs began to decline as a result of the global economic slowdown 
the company s administrative expenses are subject to period to period fluctuations due principally to obligations associated with environmental remediation and related legal issues and to the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans 
the company operates in a setting of extensive local  state and federal regulations concerning the environment and has been named as a potentially responsible party to perform environmental remediation at a number of geographic sites 
the company believes it has adequate reserves for all known environmental sites  but an adverse determination could result in a significant negative effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
expenses related to legal and environmental matters were essentially unchanged from to and declined million from to compensation expense related to the company s deferred compensation plans declined over million between and and million between and not included in administrative expenses is the investment related income or expense for the mutual funds held by the company to fund its deferred compensation obligations 
the investment income or expense is included in the other  net line in the other income expense section of the consolidated statements of income 
the pretax effect of all deferred compensation related activities is displayed below income expense for the years ended december dollars in millions deferred compensation administrative expense investment income other  net unrealized gain loss on investments other  net a net pre tax income effect a on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the company elected the fair value option for the mutual fund investment assets held for its deferred compensation plans 
as a result  unrealized gains and losses for the mutual funds are recorded in the income statement

as a result  a million non cash goodwill impairment loss was recorded in the goodwill impairment reflected an estimated reduction in the fair value of stepan uk s business as a result of lower discounted cash flow forecasts 
improvements in operating results were lower than previous forecasts used to test for impairments 
results of operations compared with summary net income for improved percent to a record million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year to year changes in net sales  profits and expenses 
a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 
consolidated net sales increased million  or percent  between years 
all reportable segments reported net sales increases 
higher average selling prices and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately million and million  respectively  of the net sales increase 
the recovery of higher raw material costs was the principal driver for the increase in average selling prices 
a more favorable customer and product mix of sales also contributed 
sales volume fell two percent between years  which reduced the growth in net sales by million 
the lower sales volume was primarily due to lower phthalic anhydride and biodiesel volume  whereas higher margin products posted sales volume growth 
specialty products was the sole segment reporting a year over year increase in sales volumes  as surfactants and polymers posted volume declines of one percent and two percent  respectively 
operating income for was million  or percent  greater than operating income 
gross profit was up million  or percent  from year to year 
the 
table of contents surfactants segment accounted for essentially all the year to year growth in gross profit 
a favorable customer and product mix coupled with selling price increases that continued to recover margin lost in prior years due to rising raw material costs drove the surfactants result 
gross profit for the specialty products segment was up slightly 
lower sales volume and higher raw material and production costs led to a decline in polymer gross profit 
operating expenses declined million  or seven percent  between years 
operating expenses for included the million gain on sale of the commodity polyurethane systems product lines and the million gain on the sale of millsdale land 
operating expenses for included a million benefit from the gain on the sale of the company s specialty esters product line  partially offset by a million impairment charge of stepan uk goodwill 
excluding the gains on sales and the impairment charge  operating expenses increased million  or percent 
the following accounted for the increase dollars in millions increase decrease incentive based compensation provision for bad debts salaries transition pension expense foreign currency translation consulting and professional fees deferred compensation expense other total improved operating results drove the rise in incentive based compensation  which includes stock based pay  bonuses and profit sharing 
the increase in bad debt expense reflected provision increases for specific customers and reserves for non specific accounts 
the increase in defined contribution transition pension expense was principally attributable to a board of directors approved acceleration of a portion of discretionary company contributions established to compensate certain employees for benefits lost when the company froze its defined benefit plans in consolidated pension transition expense was up million between years  million was allocated to cost of sales 
the reduction in deferred compensation expense reflected a large drop in the market values of mutual funds held for the deferred compensation plans  which was somewhat mitigated by a per share increase in the price of company common stock see the critical accounting policies section of this management discussion and analysis for an explanation of the accounting treatment for the company s deferred compensation plans 
the other category primarily comprises the culmination of smaller year to year variances for temporary help  agents commissions  travel and entertainment expenses and miscellaneous fringe benefits 
losses from equity joint ventures  which includes results for the percent owned stepan philippines inc spi and percent owned tiorco  llc joint ventures  increased million between years 
spi s loss increased million between years and reflected the effect approximately million of the company reserving for royalty receivables due from spi  the 
table of contents collection of which was determined to be unlikely 
lower sales volume  unplanned production outages and foreign exchange losses also contributed to the increased loss 
the recently formed tiorco  llc contributed million to the year to year increase in losses due to planned start up costs 
other  net expense increased million from year to year 
a million drop in investment related income partially offset by a million favorable swing in foreign exchange gains and losses  accounted for the year to year expense change 
unrealized losses on the mutual fund investments held for the company s deferred compensation plans caused million of the decline in investment related income 
prior to the company s january   election of fair value accounting treatment for mutual fund investment assets  unrealized investment gains and losses were recorded directly to the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
lower capital gains distributions made by the mutual funds in than in accounted for the remainder of the investment income decline 
much of the favorable swing in foreign exchange gains and losses was attributable to the impact that the recent strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar had on a us dollar denominated receivable carried on stepan canada s books 
the effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for the prior year rate was unusually high due to the recording of a charge for uk goodwill impairment for which no tax benefit was realized

the increase in selling prices accounted for approximately million of the net sales increase  while the decline in sales volume reduced the growth in net sales by million 
the higher average selling prices resulted from the recovery of higher raw material costs 
the sales volume decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of phthalic anhydride 
sales volume for phthalic anhydride dropped percent between years due largely to ongoing sluggishness in the unsaturated polyester resins market  which sells products to the automotive  recreational vehicles and boating industries 
sales volume for polyols  the largest polymer product line  increased six percent between years as demand from existing roofing insulation customers remained strong  particularly through the first three quarters of demand was down in the fourth quarter due to the downturn in the overall economy and to delayed order patterns in anticipation of lower

there is a risk that  at a future time  any of these banks could become unable to fulfill its commitment to lend on request under this agreement  which would negatively impact the company s short term liquidity 
however  it is the opinion of management that this risk has been significantly mitigated by the multi bank structure of this agreement

table of contents the above table does not include million of other non current liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at december   as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant non current liabilities excluded from the table are defined benefit pension  deferred compensation  environmental and legal liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits for which payment periods can not be reasonably determined 
pension plans the company has a number of defined benefit pension plans  the most significant of which cover employees in its us and us locations 
the us and us plans have been frozen  and service benefit accruals are no longer being made 
the underfunded status of the company s defined benefit pension plans increased percent from million at december   to million at december  poor performance of the investment assets held to fund the liabilities of the company s various pension plans accounted for most of the increase in the underfunded status 
the performance of the company s pension investment assets reflected the downturn in the equity and bond markets precipitated by the troubled us and global economies 
although the us congress approved the worker  retiree and employer recovery act of  which provides some relief from the funding requirements of the pension protection act  the required contributions to the company s defined benefit plans will increase

environmental and legal matters the company s operations are subject to extensive local  state and federal regulations 
although the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation could require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental 
table of contents expenditures 
the company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations 
during  the company s expenditures for capital projects related to the environment were million 
these projects are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which is typically years 
recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at our manufacturing locations were approximately million for  million for and million for while difficult to project  it is not anticipated that these recurring expenses will increase significantly in the future 
over the years  the company has received requests for information related to or has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at waste disposal sites where cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under cercla and similar state statutes 
in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites 
the company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it may incur with respect to the sites 
see the critical accounting policies section that follows for a discussion of the company s environmental liabilities accounting policy 
because reported liabilities are recorded based on estimates  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
after partial remediation payments at certain sites  the company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses from million to million at december   compared to million to million at december  at december  the company s accrued liability for such losses  which represents the company s best estimate within the estimated range of possible environmental and legal losses  was million compared to million at december  during  non capital cash outlays related to legal and environmental matters approximated million compared to million expended in settlement payments were down between years 
for certain sites  estimates cannot be made of the total costs of compliance or the company s share of such costs  consequently  the company is unable to predict the effect thereof on the company s cash flows or results of operations 
management believes that in the event of one or more adverse determinations in any annual or interim period  the impact on the company s cash flows or results of operations for those periods could be material 
however  based upon the company s present belief as to its relative involvement at these sites  other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred  the company believes that these matters will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
certain of these matters are discussed in item  legal proceedings  in this report and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company 
see also note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the environmental proceedings related to certain environmental sites 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
table of contents assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
deferred compensation the company sponsors deferred compensation plans that allow management to defer receipt of its bonuses and outside directors to defer receipt of their director fees until retirement  departure from the company or as elected 
the company funds its obligations associated with these plans by purchasing investment assets that match the investment choices made by the plan participants 
the investment options include company common stock and a limited selection of mutual funds 
the company maintains sufficient shares of treasury stock to cover the equivalent number of shares resulting from participants electing the company common stock option 
as a result  the company must periodically purchase its common shares on the open market 
the plans allow for the compensation being deferred to grow or decline based on the results of the investment options chosen by the participants 
some plan distributions may be made in cash or company common stock at the option of the participant 
certain plan distributions can only be made in company common stock 
upon retirement or departure from the company  participants receive cash amounts equivalent to the payment date value of the investment choices they have made or company common stock shares equal to the number of units held in their account 
for deferred compensation obligations that may be settled in cash  appreciation in the value of stepan company common stock or the mutual fund options under the plan results in additional compensation expense to the company 
conversely  declines in the value of company stock or the mutual funds result in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
it is these market price movements that result in the significant period to period fluctuations that impact the company s consolidated statements of income 
because the obligations that must be settled only in company common stock are treated as equity instruments  fluctuations in the market price of the underlying company stock do not affect earnings 
at december   the company s deferred compensation liability was million  of which approximately percent represented deferred compensation tied to the performance of the company s common stock  the remainder was tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of the company s common stock will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense 
similarly  a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will fluctuate generally in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
the mutual fund assets are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the company elected the fair value option for the mutual fund investment assets related to its deferred compensation plans 
the fair value election for the mutual fund investment assets was made to reduce the income volatility caused by the current accounting treatment for the company s deferred compensation plans 
specifically  beginning in  
table of contents market value changes for the mutual fund investment assets are recorded in the income statement in the same periods that the offsetting changes in the deferred compensation liabilities are recorded 
in and prior years  value changes for the mutual fund investments were recorded as direct adjustments to shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the accounting treatment for the portions of the deferred compensation liabilities that are tied to the company s common stock values are not affected by the fair value election 
see note  long term investments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a more detailed discussion of the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
had on the accounting treatment of the company s mutual fund investments 
dividends  capital gains distributed by the mutual funds  unrealized gains and losses and realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income loss in the other  net line of the consolidated statements of income 
because the company s common stock is held as treasury stock  no further adjustments are made to equity as a result of market price movements in the stock 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within a range of possible costs is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the remediation of environmental contamination 
see the environmental and legal matters section of this management s discussion and analysis for discussion of the company s reserves and range of loss estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
for arrangements where the company consigns product to a customer location  revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due to customers are estimated and recorded in the same period as the sales to which the discounts relate and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk because the company operates in the global marketplace  its cash flows and operating results are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company manufactures and sells products in many foreign locations and  therefore  believes its currency exchange risk is well diversified 
except as noted below  substantially all the company s foreign subsidiaries financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
gains or losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are included in income 
the company uses short term forward contracts to limit the exposure of certain foreign currency transactions and balances to fluctuating exchange rates 
at december   the company had one forward contract to sell million on behalf of its canadian subsidiary 
the company also had contracts to purchase million on behalf of its uk subsidiary 
finally  the company had contracts to sell million and to buy million on behalf of its french and german subsidiaries  respectively 
from time to time  the company and its subsidiaries extend us dollar and euro denominated trade receivables or loans to each other 
gains or losses on such transactions are recorded in income 
foreign currency exposures for the company s canadian and european subsidiaries are substantially all covered by forward contracts as noted above 
as of december   the company had net trade receivables of million due from its brazilian subsidiary 
hypothetical fluctuations of percent in the exchange rate of the brazilian real would result in a gain or loss of million 
interest rates the company s debt was composed of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  for  it is projected that interest on variable rate borrowings will total approximately million 
a hypothetical percent average change to short term interest rates would result in a million increase or decrease to interest expense for the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   which was approximately million below the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase to the fair value that would result from a hypothetical percent decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rates at december   or million 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are subject to price volatility caused by weather  petroleum prices  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
increased raw material costs are recovered from customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent the recovery of cost increases from customers  particularly in periods where there is excess industry capacity 
as a result  for some 
table of contents product lines or market segments it may take time to recover raw material price increases 
periodically  firm purchase commitments are entered into which fix the price of a specific commodity that will be delivered at a future time 
forward contracts are used to aid in managing the company s natural gas and electric costs 
at december   the company had open forward contracts for the purchase of million dekatherms of natural gas at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of natural gas  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of natural gas would cause the company s actual natural gas cost to be million higher or lower than the market price 
also at december   the company had contracts to purchase a minimum of  megawatt hours of electricity at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of electricity  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of electricity would cause the company s actual electric cost to be million higher or lower than the market price
