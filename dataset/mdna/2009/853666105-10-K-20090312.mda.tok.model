item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended december  overview we are a leading independent manufacturer  distributor and marketer of replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry 
we are organized into two major operating segments  each of which focuses on a specific segment of replacement parts 
our engine management segment manufactures ignition and emission parts  ignition wires  battery cables and fuel system parts 
our temperature control segment manufactures and remanufactures air conditioning compressors  and other air conditioning and heating parts 
we sell our products primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
we also sell our products in europe through our european segment 
we place significant emphasis on improving our financial performance by achieving operating efficiencies and improving asset utilization  while maintaining product quality and high customer order fill rates 
we intend to continue to improve our operating efficiency and cost position by focusing on company wide overhead and operating expense cost reduction programs  such as closing excess facilities and consolidating redundant functions 
for additional information about our business  strategy and competitive environment  see item  business 
seasonality 
historically  our operating results have fluctuated by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest  specifically in the temperature control segment of our business 
in addition to this seasonality  the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories 
for example  a cool summer may lessen the demand for our temperature control products  while a hot summer may increase such demand 
as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products  our working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
during this period  our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility 
inventory management 
we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns 
many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications 
in addition to warranty returns  we also permit our customers to return products to us within customer specific limits which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us in the event that they have overstocked their inventories 
we accrue for overstock returns as a percentage of sales  after giving consideration to recent returns history 
in order to better control warranty and overstock return levels  we tightened the rules for authorized warranty returns  placed further restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program so that our management can better estimate potential future product returns 
in addition  with respect to our air conditioning compressors  which are our most significant customer product warranty returns  we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not provide acceptable proof that complete air conditioning system repair was performed 
discounts  allowances and incentives 
in connection with our sales activities  we offer a variety of usual customer discounts  allowances and incentives 
first  we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discount terms of the invoice 
second  we offer pricing discounts based on volume and different product lines purchased from us 
these discounts are principally in the form of off invoice discounts and are immediately deducted from sales at the time of sale 
for those customers that choose to receive a payment on a quarterly basis instead of off invoice  we accrue for such payments as the related sales are made and reduce sales accordingly 
finally  rebates and discounts are provided to customers as advertising and sales force allowances  and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we account for these discounts and allowances as a reduction to revenues  and record them when sales are recorded 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
consolidated net sales for were million  a decrease of million or  compared to million in  driven by a million decrease in our temperature control segment due to price reductions initiated in to compete against low cost chinese imports and a decrease in our traditional market sales 
this decline was offset by increased sales in our engine management and european segments of million and million  respectively 
the increase in consolidated net sales of engine management was mainly due to continued growth in our oes customer sales combined with a year over year reduction in sales deductions such as customer returns and allowances 
these improvements were offset by a reduction in sales to our traditional market as our customers reduced their inventory due to the economic environment 
the increase in net sales in our european segment resulted from our wire and cable business acquisition in december gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  decreased by percentage points to in from in the lower gross margin resulted from decreases in engine management margins of percentage points  temperature control margins of percentage points offset  in part  by a percentage point increase in margin in our european segment 
the decrease in the engine management margin was primarily due to unabsorbed fixed costs in our planned closure of the puerto rico and long island city  new york manufacturing plants  start up and training costs at our new mexico plant  and an increase in sales from our oes customers with lower margins 
temperature control s gross margin decrease resulted primarily from price reductions initiated in and changes in product mix where sales of lower margin products have increased 
europe s increase in gross margin was due to higher margin sales from the wire and cable business acquisition partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates on increased raw material procurements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by million to million or of consolidated net sales in  as compared to million or of consolidated net sales in the decrease in sg a expenses is due primarily to a million benefit recognized in from the post retirement benefit plan amendment  which benefit commenced in june  and other cost reduction efforts offset by discount fees of million related to our customer accounts receivable factoring program and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and other indefinite life assets 
we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite life assets as of december  global economic and financial market conditions during the fourth quarter of  including severe disruptions in credit markets and the continuing economic recession  have caused us to reduce our business outlook and revenue forecasts  thereby negatively impacting our estimates of fair value 
as a result of these factors  the carrying amount of our engine management segment goodwill exceeded its corresponding fair value  resulting in a non cash goodwill impairment charge to operations of million during the fourth quarter of in addition  during we implemented a plan to transition products sold under the neihoff name to our bwd name and discontinue the neihoff brand name 
as such  we recognized a non cash impairment charge for the neihoff trademark value of million 
there were no such charges in restructuring and integration expenses 
restructuring and integration expenses increased to million in compared to million in during  we incurred million related to workforce reductions and million related to other exit costs for lease and contract termination costs as well as upkeep costs associated with vacated facilities 
the expenses are primarily for charges incurred in connection with our company wide voluntary separation package  the shutdown of our long island city  new york manufacturing operations  the closure of our puerto rico manufacturing operations  the integration of operations to our facilities in mexico and for severance in connection with the consolidation of our reno distribution operations and shutdown of our edwardsville  kansas manufacturing operations 
the expense related to charges made for the closure of our puerto rico and fort worth  texas production operations  the integration of operations to our facilities in mexico  and severance and related costs in connection with the shutdown of our long island city manufacturing operations including a million increase in our environmental reserve and an estimated million withdrawal liability as a result of our agreement with the union representing the hourly employees at our long island city manufacturing facility 
as part of the agreement  we agreed to the payment of certain severance payments upon termination of employment and to the withdrawal from the union s multi employer pension plan 
the present value of the liability was estimated at million as of december  and was recorded as part of restructuring and integration expenses 
operating income loss 
operating loss was million in  compared to operating income of million in the decrease of million was primarily due to a decline in consolidated net sales  lower gross margins as a percentage of sales driven by higher cost of goods sold due to unabsorbed fixed costs during our planned transition to new manufacturing facilities  increased restructuring and integration expenses  non cash impairment charges of million and million for goodwill and as a result of our plan to discontinue an acquired trademark  and receivable draft expenses incurred of million in connection with our factoring program that commenced in april these combined factors offset the benefit received from the post retirement plan amendment of million in other income expense  net 
other income  net was million in  which was million higher than other income  net of million in during  we completed the sale of our long island city  new york property for a sale price of million resulting in a recognized gain in of million  offset partially by a million charge related to the defeasance of our mortgage on the property 
in addition  other income  net during included a million gain on the repurchase of million principal amount of our convertible debentures 
other income  net in included a million gain on the sale of our fort worth  texas manufacturing facility  a million gain in foreign exchange  and million in dividend and interest income 
interest expense 
interest expense of million in was lower than interest expense of million in mainly due to lower borrowing costs as a result of the interest rate benefit on our restated credit agreement and accounts receivable factoring programs initiated with some of our larger customers to accelerate collection of accounts receivable balances 
discount fees associated with the program of million were recorded in sg a 
income tax provision 
the income tax benefit was million for compared to an income tax provision of million for the decrease was due to lower earnings and a lower effective tax rate  which is in compared to in the rate was lower primarily due to the tax impact of the non deductibility of a portion of the million distribution in the unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan and a portion of the goodwill impairment charge 
the rate benefited from the release of the valuation allowance related to us capital losses in consideration of the expected capital gain in connection with our sale of our long island city  new york facility 
we have concluded that our current level of valuation allowance of million continues to be appropriate  as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
earnings loss from discontinued operation 
earnings loss from discontinued operation  net of tax  reflects legal expenses associated with our asbestos related liability and adjustments thereto based on the information contained in the august actuarial study and all other available information considered by us 
we recorded million as a loss and million as a loss  both net of tax  from discontinued operation for and  respectively 
the loss for reflects a million pre tax adjustment to increase our indemnity liability in line with the august actuarial study  as well as legal fees incurred in litigation offset by a million payment received from our insurance carrier in november as discussed more fully in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
consolidated net sales for were million  a decrease of million or  compared to million in  driven by decreases in our engine management  temperature control and european segments of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in engine management sales was mainly due to higher sales deductions consisting primarily of customer warranty and overstock returns and other rebates and allowances 
the net sales decrease in our temperature control segment was due primarily to lower pricing and volume erosion caused by low cost foreign imports  partially offset by lower customer warranty returns 
europe net sales in included million related to the european temperature control business that was divested in december excluding this divested business  europe sales increased million 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  increased by percentage points to in from in mainly due to margin improvements in our engine management and european segments of percentage point and percentage points  respectively  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in our temperature control margin 
the margins in engine management and europe benefited mainly from continued improvements in procurement and lower manufacturing costs 
partially offsetting these savings in engine management were the impact of million of higher sales deductions for the year that negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of sales 
the european segment also benefited from the divestiture of its temperature control business which carried lower margins 
the decrease in temperature control margin was primarily affected by selective price decreases to match offshore price competition 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million to million or of consolidated net sales in  as compared to million or of consolidated net sales in the increase was due to a higher bad debt provision on certain accounts receivable and slightly higher general and administrative expenses  partially offset by a reduction in distribution expenses 
restructuring and integration expenses 
restructuring expenses  which include restructuring and integration expenses  increased to million in  compared to million in the expense related to charges made for the closure of our puerto rico production operations  the integration of operations in mexico  the closure of our fort worth  texas production facility and severance and related costs in connection with the shutdown of our long island city manufacturing operations 
in december  we reached an agreement with the union representing the hourly employees at our long island city manufacturing facility relating to the shutdown of our manufacturing operations 
as part of the agreement  we agreed to the payment of certain severance payments upon termination of employment and to the withdrawal from the union s multi employer pension plan 
the estimated withdrawal liability related to the multi employer plan is calculated at million paid quarterly over years 
the present value of the liability is estimated at million and was recorded as part of restructuring and integration expenses in in addition  a million increase in our environmental reserve was recorded in for remediation related to the planned sale of our long island city building 
restructuring and integration expense in related mostly to severance costs related to the move of our european and puerto rican production operations and the divestiture of a production unit of our temperature control segment 
operating income 
operating income was million in  compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to lower consolidated net sales  as well as higher restructuring and integration expenses 
other income expense  net 
other income  net was million in  which was million higher than other expense  net of million in other income  net in includes a million gain on the sale of our fort worth  texas manufacturing facility  a million gain in foreign exchange  and million in dividend and interest income 
other income expense  net in included a million loss incurred on the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business 
offsetting the loss incurred on the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business are a million gain in foreign exchange  million in joint venture equity income and million in dividend and interest income 
interest expense 
interest expense of million in was million lower than interest expense of million in the lower interest expense in was due primarily to lower borrowing costs and lower average borrowings during the year 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision was million for compared to million in the million decrease was primarily due to a lower effective rate in  which was compared to in the rate was lower due to the release of the valuation allowance related to us capital losses in consideration of the expected capital gain in connection with our sale of our long island city  new york facility 
the rate was higher due to the adverse impact of discrete items attributable to changes in state tax rates  while the estimated tax rate benefited from pre tax income in europe where previously unrecognized losses carried forward offset taxes otherwise payable 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million and are net of a valuation allowance of million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
earnings loss from discontinued operation 
earnings loss from discontinued operation  net of tax  reflects legal expenses associated with our asbestos related liability and adjustments thereto based on the information contained in the august actuarial study and all other available information considered by us 
we recorded million as a loss and million as income  both net of tax  from discontinued operation for and  respectively 
the loss for reflects a million pre tax adjustment to increase our indemnity liability in line with the august actuarial study  as well as legal fees incurred in litigation  whereas the income for reflects a million pre tax adjustment to reduce our indemnity liability in line with the august actuarial study  partially offset by legal fees incurred in litigation in liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during  cash provided by operations amounted to million  compared to cash used by operations of million million in the million increase in operating cash flow is primarily due the result of improved working capital management when compared to last year 
during the second quarter of  we began a program to sell undivided interests in certain of our receivables which improved our year over year comparison 
further working capital management improvements were realized as inventory was reduced from levels built up in in preparation for our production facility moves and accounts payable balances increased 
during  cash used by operations amounts to million  compared to cash provided by operations of million in the year over year decline of million is primarily due to an increase in inventories in order to bridge our requirements while we proceeded with facility integration efforts  an increase in accounts receivable and lower net earnings 
investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to cash used in investing activities of million in cash provided by investing activities in includes million in net cash proceeds from the sale of the long island city  new york property and million paid relating to the purchase of certain assets from a third party 
capital expenditures in were million compared to million in the comparable period last year 
for  the cash used in investing of million was a million increase to the million used in the increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of million in and the acquisition in december of a european wire and cable business for million  offset in part by proceeds of million from the sale of our fort worth  texas manufacturing facility 
during  we received million in proceeds from the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in during  we reduced our total borrowings using the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the long island city  new york property and proceeds received from our improved working capital management 
during  we defeased the remaining million mortgage loan on our long island city  new york property and repurchased million principal amount of our debentures 
during  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options was million and we purchased million of our common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the change was primarily due to higher borrowings  an increase in cash overdrafts  and proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by a million purchase of treasury stock  essentially completing our share buyback program 
in march  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation  as agent  and a syndicate of lenders for a secured revolving credit facility 
this restated credit agreement replaces our prior credit facility with general electric capital corporation  which prior credit facility provided for a million credit facility and which was to expire in the restated credit agreement provides for a line of credit of up to million inclusive of the canadian term loan described below and expires in the restated credit agreement also provides a million accordion feature  which would allow us to expand the facility 
direct borrowings under the restated credit agreement bear interest at the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined  or floating at the index rate plus the applicable margin  at our option 
the interest rate may vary depending upon our borrowing availability 
the restated credit agreement is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by certain of our assets 
in december  we amended our restated credit agreement to establish a limit of million on the amount of subordinated convertible debentures that we can repurchase in the open market prior to the closing of any additional debt financing transaction  to establish a minimum borrowing availability reserve of million  except in certain circumstances  provided that the minimum borrowing availability reserve shall be reduced to zero on the effective date of the redemption or repayment of our convertible subordinated debentures  to establish a million minimum borrowing availability requirement effective on the date of redemption or repayment of our convertible subordinated debentures  which amount may be reduced by up to million in certain circumstances  and to increase the margin added to the prime rate to and the margin added to the libor rate to  and on the earlier of a march  or b the closing of any refinancing of our convertible subordinated debentures  to further increase the margin added to the prime rate to between and the margin added to the libor rate to between  in each case depending upon the level of excess availability as defined in the credit agreement 
borrowings under the restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and those of certain of our subsidiaries 
after taking into account outstanding borrowings under the restated credit agreement  there was an additional million available for us to borrow pursuant to the formula at december   of which million is reserved for repayment  repurchase or redemption  as the case may be  of the aggregate outstanding amount of our convertible debentures 
at december  and december   the interest rate on our restated credit agreement was and  respectively 
outstanding borrowings under the restated credit agreement inclusive of the canadian term loan described below  which are classified as current liabilities  were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
at any time that our average borrowing availability over the previous thirty days is less than million or if our borrowing availability is less than million for more than two days in a consecutive day period and until such time that we have maintained an average borrowing availability of million or greater for a continuous period of ninety days  the terms of our restated credit agreement provide for  among other provisions  financial covenants requiring us  on a consolidated basis  to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage at the end of each fiscal quarter rolling twelve months  and to limit capital expenditure levels 
as of december   we were not subject to these covenants 
availability under our restated credit agreement is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets 
pursuant to our december amendment to the restated credit agreement  beginning january  and on a monthly basis thereafter  our borrowing availability will be reduced by million for the repayment  repurchase or redemption of the aggregate outstanding amount of our convertible debentures 
our restated credit agreement also permits dividends and distributions by us provided specific conditions are met 
in march  we amended our credit agreement with ge canada finance holding company  for itself and as agent for the lenders 
this amendment modifies our existing million credit agreement which was to expire in the amended credit agreement provides for a line of credit of up to million  of which million is currently outstanding and which amount is part of the million available for borrowing under our restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation described above 
the amended credit agreement is guaranteed and secured by us and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and expires in direct borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at the same rate as our restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation described above 
in december  we amended our credit agreement with ge canada finance holding company  for itself and as agent for the lenders 
the amendment provides for  among other things the allowance of cash proceeds from the divestiture of the blue streak electronics joint venture to be applied in accordance with the requirements of our us restated credit agreement  and an increase in the interest rates applicable to our outstanding borrowings under the canadian credit agreement to be in line with the increases set forth in our us restated credit agreement described above 
our european subsidiary has revolving credit facilities which  at december   provide for aggregate lines of credit up to million 
the amount of short term bank borrowings outstanding under these facilities was million on december  and million on december  the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings on december  and december  was and  respectively 
in july  we issued convertible debentures  payable semi annually  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the debentures carry an interest rate of  payable semi annually 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock  and mature on july  we may  from time to time  repurchase the debentures in the open market  or through privately negotiated transactions  on terms that we believe to be favorable with any gains or losses as a result of the difference between the net carrying amount and the reacquisition price recognized in the period of repurchase 
we intend to fund any such purchases from available cash 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of the debentures resulting in a gain on the repurchase of million 
as of december   the remaining convertible debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock at the option of the holder 
pursuant to our amendment to our revolving credit facility in december  we are limited to million in the aggregate in subordinated debentures that can be repurchased in the open market 
in order to reduce our accounts receivable balances and improve our cash flow  we sold undivided interests in certain of our receivables to financial institutions 
we entered these agreements at our discretion when we determined that the cost of factoring was less than the cost of servicing our receivables with existing debt 
pursuant to these agreements  we sold million of receivables for the year ended december  under the terms of the agreements  we retain no rights or interest  have no obligations with respect to the sold receivables and do not service the receivables after the sale 
as such  these transactions are being accounted for as a sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
a charge in the amount of million related to the sale of receivables is included in selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in august  our board of directors authorized a million increase in our stock repurchase program 
the program was in addition to our then existing program authorizing million of stock repurchases 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock  essentially completing the entire million repurchase program 
no shares of our common stock were repurchased in the comparable and periods 
we anticipate that our present sources of funds  including funds from operations and additional borrowings  will continue to be adequate to meet our financing needs over the next twelve months 
in addition  we are currently reducing spending to improve our cash flow in anticipation of the maturity of our convertible debentures 
reduction efforts include suspension of our quarterly dividend  foregoing salary increases and reduced capital expenditures 
we continue to evaluate alternative sources to further improve the liquidity of our business and to fund the refinance  repurchase or redemption  as the case may be  of the aggregate outstanding amount of our convertible debentures  which may include cash  securities or a combination thereof 
the timing  terms  size and pricing of any alternative sources of financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing 
in addition  we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could  among other things  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our convertible debentures  limit our ability to pay future dividends  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and require that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our indebtedness and the redemption of our convertible debentures instead of for funding working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
if we default on any of our indebtedness  or breach any financial covenant in our revolving credit facility  our business could be adversely affected

in march  in connection with the closing of the sale of our long island city  new york property the remaining balance of the million mortgage loan was defeased and we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser whereby we would lease space at the property 
the initial term of the lease is ten years and contains four year renewal options 
refer to note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
in july  we issued convertible debentures  payable semi annually  in the aggregate principal amount of million that are scheduled to mature on july  in  we repurchased million principal amount of the debentures resulting in a gain on the repurchase of million 
refer to note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
you should be aware that preparation of our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our engine management and temperature control segments 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for some of our sales of remanufactured products  we also charge our customers a deposit for the return of a used core component which we can use in our future remanufacturing activities 
such deposit is not recognized as revenue but rather carried as a core liability 
the liability is extinguished when a core is actually returned to us 
we estimate and record provisions for cash discounts  quantity rebates  sales returns and warranties in the period the sale is recorded  based upon our prior experience and current trends 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating sales returns and allowances relating to revenue recognized in any accounting period 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon the inventory at that location taken as a whole 
these estimates are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
we utilize cores used parts in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors 
the production of air conditioning compressors involves the rebuilding of used cores  which we acquire generally either in outright purchases or from returns pursuant to an exchange program with customers 
under such exchange programs  we reduce our inventory  through a charge to cost of sales  when we sell a finished good compressor  and put back to inventory at standard cost through a credit to cost of sales the used core exchanged at the time it is eventually received from the customer 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
at december   the allowance for sales returns was million 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts and for discounts was million 
new customer acquisition costs 
new customer acquisition costs refer to arrangements pursuant to which we incur change over costs to induce a new customer to switch from a competitor s brand 
in addition  change over costs include the costs related to removing the new customer s inventory and replacing it with standard motor products inventory commonly referred to as a stocklift 
new customer acquisition costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or recovery  respectively  within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of the adequacy of our valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods for current trends or expected changes in our estimating assumptions  we may need to modify the level of valuation allowance which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  we recognize in our financial statements only those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
we establish tax reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold 
interest and penalties associated with income tax matters are included in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consists of trademarks and trade names  patents and customer relationships 
the fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on management s assessment and independent third party appraisals 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives are not amortized to earnings  but instead are subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
we assess the impairment of long lived and identifiable intangibles assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
with respect to goodwill  we test for impairment of goodwill of a reporting unit on an annual basis or in interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  b significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and c significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to perform a second step  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fasb statement no

the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  we compare the carrying value of such assets with finite lives to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets fair value and their carrying value 
there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows requiring management s judgment in applying these assumptions and estimates to the analysis of identifiable intangibles and long lived asset impairment including projecting revenues  interest rates  tax rates and the cost of capital 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments 
in the event our planning assumptions were modified resulting in impairment to our assets  we would be required to include an expense in our statement of operations  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
retirement and post retirement medical benefits 
each year  we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions and sfas  employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
the determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated costs requires the use of actuarial computations to estimate participant plan benefits the employees will be entitled to 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are the eligibility criteria of participants  the discount rate used to value the future obligation  and expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate reflects the yields available on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current review of the long term returns on assets held by the plans  which is influenced by historical averages 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
during  we announced that  in lieu of the current us post retirement medical and dental plans previously funded on a pay as you go basis  a health reimbursement account hra will be established beginning january  for each qualified retiree thereby eliminating the need for the medical cost trend rate assumption in our actuarial computation for this plan 
share based compensation 
fas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical trends in order to estimate the amount of share based awards that will ultimately vest 
furthermore  fas r requires the monitoring of actual forfeitures and the subsequent adjustment to forfeiture rates to reflect actual forfeitures 
environmental reserves 
we are subject to various us federal and state and local environmental laws and regulations and are involved in certain environmental remediation efforts 
we estimate and accrue our liabilities resulting from such matters based upon a variety of factors including the assessments of environmental engineers and consultants who provide estimates of potential liabilities and remediation costs 
such estimates may or may not include potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted to reflect the time value of money due to the uncertainty in estimating the timing of the expenditures  which may extend over several years 
asbestos reserve 
we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
in accordance with our accounting policy  our most recent actuarial study as of august  estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments  excluding legal costs  ranging from million to million for the period through as a result  in an incremental million provision in our discontinued operation was added to the asbestos accrual increasing the reserve to approximately million as of that date 
based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all other available information considered by us  we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  according to the updated study  legal costs  which are expensed as incurred and reported in earnings loss from discontinued operation  are estimated to range from million to million during the same period 
we will continue to perform an annual actuarial analysis during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis and all other available information  we will continue to reassess the recorded liability and  if deemed necessary  record an adjustment to the reserve  which will be reflected as a loss or gain from discontinued operation 
other loss reserves 
we have other loss exposures  for such matters as product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk we have exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro  the polish zloty and the hong kong dollar 
as of december   our monetary assets and liabilities which are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore  the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rates affecting the foreign currencies in which monetary assets and liabilities are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes  we have in the past entered into interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
our percentage of variable rate debt to total debt was and at december  and  respectively 
depending upon the level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our excess cash  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have an approximate million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows
