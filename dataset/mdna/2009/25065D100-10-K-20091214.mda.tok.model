item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider significant may also have an adverse effect on us 
if any of the risks below actually occur  our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition could suffer 
our performance may be affected by general economic conditions and the continued global financial difficulties 
our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending  which have deteriorated significantly over the past approximately one year and may remain depressed  or be subject to further deterioration  for the foreseeable future 
some of the factors that are having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions  employment  consumer debt  reductions in net worth based on securities market declines  residential real estate and mortgage markets  taxation  healthcare costs  fuel and energy prices  interest rates  credit availability  consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors 
the worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles 
apparel retailing is a cyclical industry that is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending 
purchases of specialty apparel and related goods tend to be highly correlated with the cycles of the levels of disposable income of consumers 
as a result  any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect our net sales and results of operations 
downturns  or the expectation of a downturn  in general economic conditions could adversely affect consumer spending patterns  our sales and our results of operations 
consumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected 
the downturn in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our merchandise and have an adverse impact on our sales  results of operations and cash flow 
because apparel generally is a discretionary purchase  declines in consumer spending may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than on other retailers 
we may not be profitable if there is a decline in consumer spending 
the turmoil in the financial markets over the past approximately months has resulted in extreme volatility in security prices and diminished liquidity and credit availability  and there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy 
tightening of the credit markets and recent or future turmoil in the financial markets could also make it more difficult for us to access funds  to refinance our existing indebtedness if necessary  to enter into agreements for new indebtedness  or to obtain funding through the issuance of our securities 
in addition  the continued fallout from last year s credit crisis is having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world  and the impact of this crisis on our suppliers cannot be predicted 
the inability of suppliers to access liquidity  or the insolvency of suppliers  could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise 
worsening economic conditions could also result in difficulties for financial institutions including bank failures and other parties that we may do business with  which could potentially impair our ability to access financing under existing arrangements or to otherwise recover amounts as they become due under our other contractual arrangements 
additionally  either as a result of or independent of the current financial difficulties and economic weakness in the united states  material fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a negative impact on our business 
our comparable store sales and quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future and  as a result  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline substantially 
our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future and are affected by a variety of factors  including the opening of new stores and success of our leased department and licensed relationships  the timing of new store openings and leased department and licensed brand business openings  the timing of the fulfillment of purchase orders under our product and license arrangements  the extent of cannibalization of sales volume of some of our existing retail locations by our new retail locations opened in the same geographic markets  changes in our merchandise mix  any repositioning of our brands  general economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment  calendar shifts  including shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  or shifts in the number of weekend days occurring in a given month  changes in pregnancy rates  actions of competitors  the level of success and or actions of anchor tenants where we have stores or leased department and licensed relationships  fashion trends  and weather conditions and seasonality 
if  at any time  our comparable store sales or quarterly results of operations decline or do not meet the expectations of investors  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
our share price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is expected to continue to be  volatile  both because of actual and perceived changes in our financial results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the factors that could cause fluctuations in our share price may include  among other factors discussed in this section  the following actual or anticipated variations in the financial results and prospects of our business or other companies in the retail business  changes in financial estimates by wall street research analysts  actual or anticipated changes in the united states economy or the retailing environment  changes in the market valuations of other specialty apparel or retail companies  announcements by our competitors or us  additions and departures of key personnel  changes in accounting principles  the passage of legislation or other developments affecting us or our industry  the trading volume of our common stock in the public market  changes in economic conditions  financial market conditions  natural disasters  terrorist acts  acts of war or periods of civil unrest  and the realization of some or all of the risks described in this section entitled risk factors 
in addition  the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations from time to time  and the market prices of the equity securities of retailers have been extremely volatile and are sometimes subject to sharp price and trading volume changes 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may not be successful in expanding our business and opening new stores 
any future growth depends significantly on our ability to successfully establish and operate new stores including combo stores and superstores and our leased department and licensed relationships on a profitable basis  as well as the success and profitability of our international business  including through franchising relationships 
this growth  if it occurs  will place increased demands on our management  operational and administrative resources 
these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which  in turn  could cause a deterioration in our financial performance and negatively impact our growth 
any planned growth will also require that we continually monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems  as well as our distribution infrastructure 
our ability to establish and operate new stores and our leased department and licensed relationships successfully depends on many factors  including  among others  our ability to identify and obtain suitable store locations  including mall locations  the availability of which is outside of our control  retain existing  expand existing and establish new leased department and licensed relationships  negotiate favorable lease terms for stores  including desired tenant improvement allowances  negotiate favorable lease terminations for existing store locations in markets where we intend to open new combo stores or superstores  source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores and our leased department and licensed relationships  successfully address competition  merchandising and distribution challenges  and hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified store personnel 
the success and profitability of our international relationships depends on many factors  including  among others the ability of our franchisees to identify and obtain suitable store locations  including mall locations  the availability of which is outside of their control  the ability of our franchisees to negotiate favorable lease terms for stores  including desired tenant improvement allowances  our ability to source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of our franchisees international operations  our ability and the ability of our franchisees to successfully address competition  merchandising and distribution challenges  and the ability of our franchisees to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified store personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our business and achieve our goals 
even if we succeed in establishing new stores  further developing our leased department and licensed relationships and further expanding our international relationships  we cannot assure that these initiatives will achieve planned revenue or profitability levels in the time periods estimated by us  or at all 
if any of these initiatives fails to achieve or is unable to sustain acceptable revenue and profitability levels  we may incur significant costs 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by few barriers to entry 
we compete against department stores  specialty retail chains  discount stores  independent retail stores and catalog and internet based retailers 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
further  we do not typically advertise using television and radio media and thus do not reach customers through means our competitors may use 
our mid and luxury priced merchandise faces a highly fragmented competitive landscape that includes locally based  single unit retailers  as well as a handful of multi unit maternity operations  none of which we believe have more than stores nationwide 
in the value priced maternity apparel business  we face competition on a nationwide basis from retailers such as gap  jcpenney  old navy  target and wal mart 
all of these competitors also sell maternity apparel on their websites 
over the past few years  there has been increased competition in the maternity apparel business from both new and existing competition 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by this competition  including the potential for increased competition in the future 
for example  the maternity apparel business has previously experienced oversupply conditions due to increased competition in the maternity apparel business  which resulted in a greater level of industry wide markdowns and markdowns recognized by us on sales from our retail locations 
there can be no assurance that these conditions will not occur again or worsen 
our relationships with third party retailers may not be successful 
we cannot guarantee successful results from or the continuation of our leased department and licensed relationships with third party retailers such as sears  kmart  macy s  bloomingdales  babies r us  boscov s  gordmans and kohl s 
under our agreement with kohl s  subject to certain notice obligations  kohl s is not obligated to purchase any maternity apparel from us and we are not obligated to sell any maternity apparel to them 
under our agreement with our leased department partners  those partners do not make any promises or representations as to the potential amount of business we can expect from the sale of our product in their stores 
we do not control the pricing terms or the timing or degree of the markdowns at kohl s 
the success of our leased department and licensed brand businesses is highly dependent on the actions and decisions of the third party retailers  which are outside of our control 
the retailers could limit the merchandise carried  close stores  go out of business or terminate their agreements with us 
our failure to properly manage our leased department and licensed brand businesses including any failure by us in timely delivering goods to any third party retailer or any failure to respond to the actions of or changes in business conditions at third party retailers would have a direct impact on the profitability and continuation of these relationships 
we require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness  which reduces the cash available to finance any growth and could adversely affect our financial health 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness and we have the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
our ability to make required payments on our indebtedness  as well as to fund our operations and future growth  depends upon our ability to generate cash 
our success in generating cash depends upon the results of our operations  as well as upon general economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to making payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to implement our growth strategy  or to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate needs  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates as some of our debt is  and will continue to be  at variable rates of interest  and our available borrowings under our credit facility  to the extent borrowed in the future  would be at variable rates of interest  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  or debt at lower interest rates  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  make it more difficult for us to open new stores or improve or expand existing stores  restrict our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders  require us to pledge all or substantially all of our assets as collateral to secure indebtedness  and make it more difficult for us to pursue strategic acquisitions  alliances and partnerships 
if we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before the scheduled maturity dates of such debt  sell assets or raise equity 
on such maturity dates  we may need to refinance our indebtedness if our operations do not generate enough cash to pay such indebtedness in full and if we do not raise additional capital 
our ability to refinance will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
our term loan  with an outstanding balance of million as of september   bears interest at a variable rate equal to  at our election  either i the prime rate plus  or ii a libor rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings is either or  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined 
based upon our applicable quarterly consolidated leverage ratio during fiscal  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings remained at for fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal based upon our consolidated leverage ratio as of september   the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings will be effective for the second quarter of fiscal in order to mitigate our floating rate interest risk on the variable rate term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that commenced on april  and expires on april  the interest rate swap agreement enables us to effectively convert an amount of the term loan equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swap from a floating interest rate of libor plus subject to reduction to libor plus if we achieve a specified leverage ratio  to a fixed interest rate of subject to reduction to if we achieve a specified leverage ratio for the significant majority of the term loan 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at the inception of the swap agreement and decreases over time to a notional amount of million at the expiration date 
the notional amount of the swap was million as of september  and over the next eighteen months decreases as follows to million starting october   to million starting april   and to million starting october  regardless of our attempts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the interest rate swap  we still have exposure for the un swapped amounts of the term loan borrowings  which remain subject to a variable interest rate 
as a result  an increase in interest rates could result in a substantial increase in interest expense  especially as the swapped amount of the term loan decreases over time 
we are heavily dependent on our management information systems and our ability to maintain and upgrade these systems from time to time 
the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on our internally developed management information systems 
in particular  we rely on point of sale terminals  which provide information to our customized merchandise analysis and planning system used to track sales and inventory 
the merchandise analysis and planning system helps integrate our design  manufacturing  distribution and financial functions  and also provides daily financial and merchandising information 
although our software programs and data are backed up and securely stored off site  our servers and computer systems are located at our headquarters in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if our servers and systems were inoperable or inaccessible 
from time to time  we improve and upgrade our management information systems 
we have a proprietary  internet based point of sale system 
if we are unable to maintain and upgrade our systems or to integrate new and updated systems in an efficient and timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as an apparel retailer  we rely on numerous third parties in the supply chain to produce and deliver the products that we sell  and our business may be negatively impacted by disruptions in the supply chain 
if we lose the services of one or more of our significant suppliers or one or more of them fail to meet our product needs  we may be unable to obtain replacement merchandise in a timely manner 
if our existing suppliers cannot meet our increased needs and we cannot locate alternative supply sources  we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the most popular items at attractive prices  which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations 
we obtain apparel and other merchandise from foreign sources  both purchased directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 
to the extent that any of our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products  any event causing a disruption of imports  including the imposition of import restrictions  could harm our ability to source product 
this disruption could materially limit the merchandise that we would have available for sale and reduce our sales and earnings 
the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability  or war  in or affecting any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured or through which they flow 
trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas  embargos and customs restrictions that are applicable to the products that we sell also could affect the import of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us 
any material increase in tariff levels  or any material decrease in quota levels or available quota allocation  could negatively impact our business 
further  changes in tariffs or quotas for merchandise imported from individual foreign countries could lead us to shift our sources of supply among various countries 
any such shift we undertake in the future could result in a disruption of our sources of supply and lead to a reduction in our sales and earnings 
supply chain security initiatives undertaken by the united states government that impede the normal flow of product could also negatively impact our business 
in addition  decreases in the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies could increase the cost of products that we purchase from overseas vendors 
we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with relying on vendors that do business in foreign markets and import merchandise from abroad  such as political instability or the threat of terrorism  particularly in countries where our vendors source merchandise  enhanced security measures at united states and foreign ports  which could delay delivery of imports  imposition of new or supplemental duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  delayed receipt or non delivery of goods due to the failure of foreign source suppliers to comply with applicable import regulations  delayed receipt or non delivery of goods due to organized labor strikes or unexpected or significant port congestion at united states ports  and local business practice and political issues  including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards  which may result in adverse publicity 
the united states may impose new initiatives that adversely affect the trading status of countries where apparel is manufactured 
these initiatives may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that  if enacted  would increase the cost of products imported from countries where our vendors acquire merchandise 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be materially and adversely affected if our distribution operations were disrupted 
to support our distribution of product throughout the world  we operate our main distribution facility in philadelphia  pennsylvania and two significantly smaller distribution facilities  one in philadelphia  pennsylvania and the other  serving as our canadian distribution facility  in mississauga  ontario 
finished garments from contractors and other manufacturers are inspected and stored for distribution to our stores 
we do not have other distribution facilities to support our distribution needs 
if our main philadelphia distribution facility were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason  we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products to our stores during the time it takes to reopen or replace this facility 
in light of our strategic emphasis on rapid replenishment as a competitive strength  a distribution disruption might have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operations and profitability relative to other retailers 
in addition  the loss or material disruption of service from any of our shippers for any reason  whether due to freight difficulties  strikes  natural disaster or other difficulties at our principal transport providers or otherwise  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain sufficient raw materials or maintain satisfactory manufacturing arrangements 
we do not own any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend on third parties to manufacture our products 
we place our orders for production of merchandise and raw materials by purchase order and do not have any long term contracts with any manufacturer or supplier 
we compete with many other companies for production facilities and raw materials 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
if we fail to maintain favorable relationships with these third parties  or if we cannot obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials on commercially reasonable terms  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stores are heavily dependent on the customer traffic generated by shopping malls 
we depend heavily on locating our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls in order to generate customer traffic 
we cannot control the development of new shopping malls  the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls or the success of existing or new mall stores 
the success of all of our mall stores will depend  in part  on the ability of each mall s anchor tenants  such as large department stores  other tenants and area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores  and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations 
many traditional enclosed malls are experiencing significantly lower levels of customer traffic than in the past driven by overall poor economic conditions as well as the closure of certain mall anchor tenants 
sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area  the closing of anchor tenants or competition from non mall retailers and other malls where we do not have stores 
our success depends on our ability to identify and rapidly respond to fashion trends 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  our success depends on the priority that our target customers place on fashion and our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends 
our ability or our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles or trends could lead to  among other things  excess inventories and higher markdowns  as well as the decreased appeal of our brands 
particular fashion trends  or an inaccuracy of our forecasts regarding fashion trends  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in fiscal we were negatively impacted from the popularity of certain styles in the non maternity women s apparel market  such as trapeze and baby doll dresses and tops  which can more readily fit a pregnant woman early in her pregnancy than typical non maternity fashions 
the failure to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified senior management personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to timely deliver and display fashionable merchandise in appropriate quantities in our stores 
this execution requires experienced and talented management 
we currently have a management team with a great deal of experience with us and in apparel retailing 
if we were to lose the benefit of this experience  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
on november   we announced the retirement of rebecca matthias  our co founder  at the end of fiscal pursuant to our transition agreement with ms 
matthias  she will be a full time employee of the company until june  after june   ms 
matthias will remain in an employment relationship with us on a part time basis through september   and will then provide consulting services to us  as requested  through september  if we were unable to compensate for the loss of the benefit of ms 
matthias experience  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  as our business expands  we believe that our success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there is a high level of competition for personnel in the retail industry 
like most retailers  we experience significant employee turnover rates  particularly among store sales associates and managers  and our continued growth will require us to hire and train even more new personnel 
we therefore must continually attract  hire and train new personnel to meet our staffing needs 
we constantly compete for qualified personnel with companies in our industry and in other industries 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs and could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity 
if we are unable to retain our employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other skilled personnel in the future  we may not be able to service our customers as effectively  which could impair our ability to increase sales and could otherwise harm our business 
our quarterly operating results and inventory levels may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality in our business 
our business  like that of other retailers  is seasonal 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon  among other things  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  the timing of new store openings and new leased department openings  net sales and profitability contributed by new stores and leased departments  the timing of the fulfillment of purchase orders under our product and license arrangements  adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays and promotions  changes in inventory and production levels and the timing of deliveries of inventory  and changes in our merchandise mix 
our quarterly net sales have historically been highest in our third fiscal quarter  corresponding to the spring selling season  followed by our first fiscal quarter  corresponding to the fall holiday selling season 
given the historically higher sales level in our third fiscal quarter and the relatively fixed nature of most of our operating expenses and interest expense  we have typically generated a very significant percentage of our full year operating income and net income during our third fiscal quarter 
thus  any factors which result in a material reduction of our sales for the third quarter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for our fiscal year as a whole 
seasonal fluctuations in sales also affect our inventory levels  as we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory  especially before the fall holiday and spring selling seasons 
if we are not successful in selling our inventory during this period  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to sell the excess inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on sustained demand for maternity clothing and is sensitive to birth rates  women s fashion trends  economic conditions and consumer spending 
our business depends upon sustained demand for maternity clothing 
our future performance will be subject to a number of factors beyond our control  including demographic changes  fashion trends  economic conditions and consumer spending 
if demand for maternity clothing were to decline for any reason  such as a decrease in the number of pregnancies  our operating results could be adversely affected 
additionally  our operating results could be adversely affected if certain non maternity women s apparel fashions have a more pregnancy friendly fit 
for example  in fiscal  we were negatively impacted by the popularity of certain styles in the non maternity women s apparel market  such as trapeze and baby doll dresses and tops  which can more readily fit a pregnant woman early in her pregnancy than typical non maternity fashions 
downturns  or the expectation of a downturn  in general economic conditions could adversely affect consumer spending patterns  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the specialty apparel retail business historically has been subject to cyclical variations 
consumer purchases of specialty apparel products  including maternity wear  may decline during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income is lower 
declines in consumer spending patterns may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than some other retailers 
therefore  we may not be able to maintain our historical sales and earnings  or remain as profitable  if there is a decline in consumer spending patterns 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or is accused of violating any such laws  or if their labor practices diverge from those generally accepted as ethical  it could harm our business and brand image 
while we maintain policies and guidelines with respect to labor practices that independent manufacturers that produce goods for us are contractually required to follow  and while we have an independent firm and company employees inspect certain manufacturing sites to monitor compliance  we cannot control the actions of such manufacturers or the public s perceptions of them  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using ethical or legal labor practices 
apparel companies can be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the manufacturers of their products 
while many of our independent manufacturers are routinely monitored by buying representatives  who assist us in the areas of compliance  garment quality and delivery  we do not control the manufacturers business practices or their employees employment conditions  and manufacturers act in their own interest which may be in a manner that results in negative public perceptions of us  and or employee allegations against us or court determinations that we are jointly liable 
violations of law by our importers  buying agents  manufacturers or distributors could result in delays in shipments and receipt of goods and could subject us to fines or other penalties  any of which could restrict our business activities  increase our operating expenses or cause our sales to decline 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property and may be subject to liability if we are alleged to have infringed on another party s intellectual property 
we believe that our trademarks  service marks and other intellectual property are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition with our customers 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks  service marks and other intellectual property 
although we actively protect our intellectual property  there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks  service marks and other intellectual property  including our rights in our management information systems and our proprietary rights in products for which we have applied for patent protection for example  our secret fit belly innovation  will be adequate to prevent imitation of our marks  products or services by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks  service marks or other proprietary rights 
also  others may assert rights in  or ownership of  our trademarks and other proprietary rights or may allege that we have or are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our trademarks and proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that these registrations will prevent imitation of our name  merchandising concept  store design or private label merchandise  or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others 
imitation of our name  concept  store design or merchandise in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the high expense in both prosecuting and defending against  and potential liability related to  alleged infringements of intellectual property rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and otherwise adversely impact our business 
in the event of war or acts of terrorism  or if either is threatened  our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale may be negatively affected 
a substantial portion of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be adversely affected 
in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our main distribution facility and retail locations  as well as fulfilling internet orders 
the terms of our debt instruments impose financial and operating restrictions 
our credit facility and term loan agreements each contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
these covenants limit or restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of our equity securities  or purchase or redeem capital stock  or make certain investments  have our subsidiaries pay dividends  make loans or transfer assets to us  sell assets  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries  enter into any transactions with our affiliates  transfer any capital stock of any subsidiary or permit any subsidiary to issue capital stock  create liens  enter into certain sale leaseback transactions  and effect a consolidation or merger or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets 
these limitations and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests 
in addition  our ability to borrow under the credit facility is subject to borrowing base requirements 
if we breach any of the covenants in our credit facility or term loan agreements  we may be in default under our credit facility and or our term loan 
if we default  the lenders under our term loan or the lender under our credit facility could declare all borrowings owed to them  including accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable 
our charter documents contain certain anti takeover provisions  and we are entitled to certain other protective provisions under delaware law 
we are a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of the company  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
we also have adopted a stockholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill  that entitles our stockholders to acquire additional shares of us  or a potential acquirer of us  at a substantial discount to their market value in the event of an attempted takeover 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable by  among other things authorizing the issuance of preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the discretion of our board of directors  restricting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at meetings 
these provisions may also reduce the market value of our common stock 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the terms of each of our credit facility and term loan agreements restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock 
even if our ability to pay dividends were not restricted  any future payment of dividends would still be at the discretion of our board of directors and would be based upon any applicable restrictive financial covenants  earnings  capital requirements and our financial condition  among other factors  at the time any such dividend is considered 
any increase in our sales and marketing efforts that target markets outside the united states and canada would expose us to additional risks associated with international operations 
although an immaterial amount of our sales are currently derived from international sales outside of canada  we are actively seeking to expand our international presence  and we have begun to do so through franchise arrangements in the middle east and india 
we may not be successful in these efforts 
international operations and sales subject us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states 
for example  we may depend on third parties to market our products through foreign sales channels  and we may be challenged by laws and business practices favoring local competitors 
in addition  our ability to succeed in foreign markets will depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we must also adapt our pricing structure to address different pricing environments and may face difficulty in enforcing revenue collection internationally 
emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy 
the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks 
deterioration of social  political  labor  or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results or those of our franchisees 
operations outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws  policies and measures  and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment  including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments 
to the extent we achieve significant sales outside of the united states in the future  we may have significant exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we could have failures in our system of internal controls 
we maintain a documented system of internal controls which is reviewed and monitored by management  who meet regularly with our audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe we have a well designed system to maintain adequate internal controls on the business 
we cannot assure you that there will not be any control deficiencies in the future 
should we become aware of any control deficiencies  we would report them to the audit committee and recommend prompt remediation 
we have devoted significant resources to document  test  monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so  however  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls are adequate in the future or that adequate controls will be effective in preventing fraud 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations

unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties we own our principal executive offices and distribution facility  which is located at north fifth street  philadelphia  pennsylvania  subject to a mortgage under the terms of which we owe approximately million as of september  this facility consists of approximately  square feet  of which approximately  square feet is dedicated to office space and the remaining square footage is used for finished goods warehousing and distribution 
on august   we entered into a ten year lease for a facility located at kitty hawk avenue  philadelphia  pennsylvania in the philadelphia naval business center 
the area leased at this facility  which we use for some finished goods warehousing and distribution  as well as raw material cutting and warehousing  consists of approximately  square feet of space 
to facilitate our store growth in canada  we entered into a three year lease commencing november  for approximately  square feet of finished goods warehouse and distribution space in mississauga  ontario in canada 
since this time  we have renewed this lease in canada on multiple occasions and it currently expires on october  from time to time we may also utilize third party warehousing services in the philadelphia  pennsylvania area when we have increased storage requirements 
these services essentially operate on a month to month basis 
we believe that these facilities will be adequate to support our anticipated distribution needs for the near term and  potentially  longer 
in the event we need additional space to meet our future distribution needs  we believe that such space would be readily available 
our facilities are subject to state and local regulations that range from building codes to health and safety regulations 
we lease our store premises for initial terms averaging from five to ten years 
certain leases allow us to terminate or reduce our obligations at specified points in time in the event that the applicable store does not achieve a specified sales volume 
some of our store leases also provide for contingent payments based on sales volume  escalations of the base rent  as well as increases in operating costs  marketing costs and real estate taxes 
as of september   the following numbers of store leases are set to expire as listed in the table below 
we do not expect the expiration of any leases to have a material adverse impact on our business or operations 
fiscal year leases expire number of stores and later total in addition to the stores we operate  we have arrangements with department and specialty stores  including sears  kmart  macy s  bloomingdale s  babies r us  boscov s and gordmans to operate maternity apparel departments in their stores 
these leased departments typically involve the lease partner collecting all of the revenue from the leased department 
the revenue is remitted to us  less a fixed percentage of the net sales earned by the lease partner as stipulated in the agreement 
we provide at least some amount of staffing for each of the leased departments  with the amount varying depending on the specific arrangement 
generally  under each of our leased department agreements  our lease partner has the right to terminate any or all of our rights to operate our leased departments in their stores subject to varying notice requirements 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and although the amount of any liability that could arise with respect to currently pending actions cannot be accurately predicted  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending action will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity

we provide these measures to investors to assist them in performing their analysis of our historical operating results 
the non gaap financial measures included in other financial data reflect a measure of our operating results before consideration of certain charges and consequently  none of these measures should be construed as an alternative to net income loss or operating income loss as an indicator of our operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity  as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and their related notes included elsewhere in this report 
we are the leading designer and retailer of maternity apparel in the united states with  retail locations  including stores in all states  puerto rico  guam and canada  and leased departments located within department stores and baby specialty stores throughout the united states 
we are also the exclusive provider of maternity apparel to kohl s  which operates approximately  stores throughout the united states 
during fiscal  we operated our stores under the motherhood maternity  a pea in the pod and destination maternity retail concepts 
we are the exclusive maternity apparel provider in each of our leased department relationships 
in october  we re launched our two hearts maternity by destination maternity collection at sears and kmart stores 
as of november   we operate maternity apparel departments in sears locations and kmart locations 
the two hearts maternity collection was previously offered in sears stores from april through june we also are expanding internationally and have entered into exclusive store franchise and product supply relationships in india and the middle east 
finally  we also sell merchandise on the internet  primarily through destinationmaternity 
com and our various brand specific websites 
we design and contract manufacture approximately of the merchandise we sell  using sewing factories located throughout the world  predominantly outside of the united states 
substantially all of the merchandise produced outside of the united states is paid for in us dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  future reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and the related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with the audit committee of our board of directors 
inventories 
we value our inventories  which consist primarily of maternity apparel  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method fifo and includes the cost of merchandise  freight  duty and broker fees  as well as applied product related overhead 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly valued at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current analysis of merchandise based on receipt date  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
criteria utilized by us to determine the net realizable value of our inventories and the related level of required inventory reserves include factors such as the amount of merchandise received within the past twelve months  merchandise received more than one year before with quantities on hand in excess of twelve months of sales  and merchandise currently selling below cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value  if required 
inventories as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
given the significance of inventories to our consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment included in the property  plant and equipment  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and  to a much lesser extent  patent and lease acquisition costs included in the other intangible assets  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets 
these long lived assets are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life 
net long lived assets as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of these assets  we periodically evaluate the historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as i store type  that is  company store or leased department  ii store concept  that is  motherhood  pea or destination maternity  iii store location  for example  urban area versus suburb  iv current marketplace awareness of our brands  v local customer demographic data  vi anchor stores within the mall in which our store is located and vii current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which is assumed to be within two years from the date a store location is opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
as a result of our impairment assessment  we recorded write downs of long lived assets of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
goodwill 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is separately disclosed in our consolidated balance sheets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting pronouncement  which required that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or as impairment indicators arise 
the impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to their carrying value  including assigned goodwill 
in assessing potential impairment of goodwill  we have determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of applying the accounting requirements based on our reporting structure 
the fair value of our single reporting unit is determined based on a combination of the fair market value of our outstanding common stock on a control basis  a discounted cash flow analysis and other generally accepted valuation methodologies and  if necessary  with the assistance of an outside independent valuation specialist 
to arrive at the fair market value of our outstanding common stock we consider our market capitalization as of the valuation date and comparative market multiples of other companies generally influenced by similar business and economic conditions 
our discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future growth used to manage the underlying business 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors and control premium  among other considerations 
the carrying value of our single reporting unit  expressed on a per share basis  is represented by the book value per share of our outstanding common stock 
as of september  and  goodwill totaled zero and million  respectively  representing zero percent and of total assets  respectively 
as of september   our book value was per share of outstanding common stock and the closing trading price of our common stock was per share 
as part of our impairment analysis as of september   an outside independent valuation was obtained and the results indicated the fair value of our single reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
if the per share fair value of our single reporting unit was less than the book value per share on september   our goodwill would have been impaired 
our goodwill also needs to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value 
as a result of a substantial decrease in the market price of our common stock subsequent to september   reflecting deteriorating overall economic conditions and the very difficult equity market conditions  we reassessed the carrying value of our goodwill as of december   in accordance with the interim period accounting requirements and concluded that our goodwill was impaired 
consequently  we recorded a preliminary non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  on both a pretax and after tax basis  in the first quarter of fiscal the preliminary goodwill impairment charge reflected the indication from the impairment analysis performed in the first quarter of fiscal  was subject to finalization of certain fair value estimates being performed with the assistance of an outside independent valuation specialist  and was subject to adjustment when all aspects of the analysis were completed 
the final results of our evaluation completed during the second quarter of fiscal indicated the goodwill was fully impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge  on both a pretax and after tax basis  in the second quarter of fiscal  representing the remaining carrying value of the goodwill as of december  the goodwill impairment analysis involved calculating the implied fair value of our goodwill by allocating the fair value of our single reporting unit to all assets and liabilities other than goodwill including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets and comparing the residual amount to the carrying value of goodwill 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure including interest and penalties together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we establish reserves for certain tax positions that we believe are supportable  but such tax positions are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal and state tax laws and regulations currently in effect  some of which have been recently revised 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain of the states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our state income tax expense and our state income taxes paid  which could have a material and adverse effect on our net income or cash flow 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from our assessments if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
net deferred tax assets as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted 
accounting for contingencies 
from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with applicable accounting standards  which require us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management  after consultation with outside legal counsel  to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
restructuring and other charges on july   we announced that we were streamlining our merchandise brands and store nameplates and implementing cost reductions in order to simplify our business model  reduce overhead costs and improve and tighten our merchandise assortments 
pursuant to the strategic restructuring  we rebranded our mimi maternity merchandise brand under our a pea in the pod brand beginning with the spring collection  which initially debuted in november we also streamlined our store nameplates  which began in november  by renaming our single brand mimi maternity stores as a pea in the pod  and by renaming our multi brand mimi maternity stores as destination maternity 
in connection with the strategic restructuring we also reduced our corporate and field management headcount  and during fiscal we began to implement actions to achieve further cost reductions 
the objectives of our restructuring and cost reduction program are to improve and simplify critical processes  consolidate activities and infrastructure  and reduce our expense structure to be more appropriately aligned with our generation of revenue 
we incurred pretax expense of approximately million from our restructuring and cost reduction actions in fiscal  consisting of approximately million for consulting services related to our cost reduction initiatives  million for cash severance expense and severance related benefits  and approximately million of non cash expense for accelerated depreciation of existing store signs resulting from planned store signage changes 
we incurred pretax expense of approximately million from our restructuring in fiscal  consisting of approximately million for cash severance expense and severance related benefits  and approximately million of non cash expense for accelerated depreciation of existing store signs 
as of september   we had a commitment under a consulting agreement for minimum fees and expenses of approximately million  of which approximately million was recorded in fiscal  based upon services rendered in fiscal we expect total additional expense of approximately million  including but not entirely consisting of the remaining minimum commitment for consulting services related to our cost reduction initiatives  to be recorded in fiscal  of which the majority may occur in the first quarter 
these initiatives resulted in approximate pretax savings of million in fiscal  with incremental pretax savings of approximately million projected for fiscal we project total annualized pretax savings of approximately to million in fiscal as a result of our cost reduction initiatives  which includes the savings realized in fiscal plus the incremental projected savings for fiscal in connection with the retirement of dan matthias  our former chief executive officer former ceo  effective september   we recognized pretax expense of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the charge reflects benefit costs and payroll taxes related to an amendment to the executive s supplemental retirement agreement with us 
subsequent to his retirement  our former ceo continued to serve us as non executive chairman of the board and is available to our ceo in a consulting capacity  for which our former ceo is being paid an annual retainer of  through september in november  our former ceo entered into a letter agreement with us  which confirmed that he would not seek reelection to the board of directors after the expiration of his current term in january the agreement does not change the terms of payment under his annual retainer for advisory services  however we will incur a non cash pretax charge of approximately million primarily in the first quarter of fiscal  representing the amount due for the remaining term of the advisory arrangement 
in connection with the announced retirement of rebecca matthias  our president and chief creative officer  at the end of fiscal  we expect to incur a pretax charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal the charge reflects benefit costs related to an amendment to the executive s supplemental retirement agreement with us

our net sales for fiscal decreased by  or approximately million  to million from million for fiscal comparable store sales decreased by during fiscal versus a comparable store sales increase of during fiscal the decrease in sales versus last year resulted primarily from the decrease in comparable store sales and the decrease in sears leased department sales due to the closure of all of the remaining leased departments within sears stores during june in october we re launched our two hearts maternity collection at over sears and kmart locations 
as of september   we operated a total of stores and  total retail locations motherhood maternity stores including motherhood maternity outlet stores  a pea in the pod stores  destination maternity stores  and leased maternity apparel departments  which were primarily under the motherhood brand

in addition  during fiscal  we opened leased department locations and closed leased department locations 
gross profit 
our gross profit for fiscal decreased by  or approximately million  to million compared to million for fiscal  primarily reflecting the effect of our lower sales volume compared to last year  substantially offset by increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin 
gross margin was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase in gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to higher merchandise gross margin from reduced product costs and lower overall markdown levels  and to a lesser extent due to reduced product related overhead costs related to our cost reduction initiatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal this decrease in expense resulted primarily from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives  including reduced corporate payroll  field management payroll  store payroll and store occupancy expenses  and the elimination of operating expenses related to the sears leased departments  which were not open at all during fiscal  partially offset by higher variable incentive compensation expense resulting from increased profitability 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to compared to for fiscal this increase in the expense percentage for fiscal resulted primarily from negative expense leverage from the decrease in sales  partially offset by the million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses

goodwill impairment expense 
we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million in fiscal to reflect the full impairment of our goodwill based on the results of the impairment analysis performed in fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion 
operating income loss 
we had an operating loss of million for fiscal before the goodwill impairment charges  our operating income for fiscal was million  an increase of or approximately million  from the million of operating income for fiscal  which had no goodwill impairment charge 
the increase in operating income  before the goodwill impairment charges  was primarily due to lower selling  general and administrative expenses  and lower store closing  asset impairment and asset disposal costs 
operating income  before the goodwill impairment charges  as a percentage of net sales for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the increase in operating income  before the goodwill impairment charges  as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our higher gross margin  partially offset by our higher operating expense ratio compared to fiscal interest expense  net 
our net interest expense for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million in fiscal this decrease was due to our lower debt level  primarily as a result of the million of term loan prepayments we made in fiscal  and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates and lower credit line borrowings 
during fiscal and  our average daily level of direct borrowings under our credit facility was million and million  respectively 
we did not have any direct borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as of september  loss on extinguishment of debt

there is no difference between basic and diluted shares outstanding for both fiscal and fiscal  as a result of the elimination of the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and restricted stock  due to the net loss in both fiscal and fiscal had we reported a profit for fiscal and fiscal  the weighted average number of dilutive shares outstanding for computation of diluted earnings per share diluted eps would have been approximately  and  respectively

our net sales for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in sales versus last year resulted primarily from a decrease in sales from our leased department and licensed relationships  largely due to a decrease in sears leased department sales due to the closure of all of the remaining leased departments within sears stores during june  as well as reduced sales volume from the ongoing closure of certain underperforming stores  partially offset by increased internet sales and a slight increase in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales increased by during fiscal versus a comparable store sales decrease of during fiscal as of september   we operated a total of stores and  total retail locations motherhood maternity stores including motherhood maternity outlet stores  mimi maternity stores  a pea in the pod stores  destination maternity superstores  and leased maternity apparel departments  which were primarily under the motherhood brand 
in addition  our oh baby by motherhood collection is available at kohl s stores throughout the united states

in comparison  as of september   we operated multi brand stores  including destination maternity superstores 
these multi brand store figures for fiscal and fiscal exclude our a pea in the pod stores  which have traditionally carried a full line of both a pea in the pod and mimi branded merchandise 
during fiscal  we opened stores  including multi brand stores  and closed stores  with of these store closings related to multi brand store openings 
in addition  during fiscal  we opened leased department locations and closed leased department locations  including the sears leased departments operated by us at the end of september gross profit 
our gross profit for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million compared to million for fiscal  reflecting the decrease in net sales as well as a decrease in gross margin 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects increased markdowns to help manage our inventory level  product cost inflation pressures that are being felt throughout the apparel industry  and the effect of spreading fixed product overhead costs over a smaller sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal this decrease in expense resulted primarily from significantly lower legal expenses  and from lower store occupancy  payroll and employee benefits costs  as a result of our reduced number of stores and leased departments 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses remained consistent at for fiscal and fiscal store closing  asset impairment and asset disposal expenses 
our store closing  asset impairment and asset disposal expenses for fiscal increased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal we incurred impairment charges for write downs of long lived assets of million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal we incurred charges relating to store closings and other asset disposals of million for fiscal  comprised of million of cash lease termination fees and million of non cash other asset disposal costs  which were primarily related to store relocations  as compared to  for fiscal  comprised of million of cash lease termination fees offset by million non cash gain on asset disposals from closed stores 
restructuring and other charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred pretax expense of million from our strategic restructuring and cost reduction initiatives 
we also recognized a million charge in connection with the retirement of our former ceo 
the charge reflects benefit costs and payroll taxes related to an amendment to the executive s supplemental retirement agreement with us 
operating income 
our operating income for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal  due to the lower sales volume  lower gross margin and associated gross profit reduction  as well as the restructuring and other charges and increased store closing and asset impairment costs  partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income as a percentage of net sales operating income margin for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to our decreased gross margin for fiscal compared to fiscal and the restructuring and other charges incurred in fiscal interest expense  net 
our net interest expense for fiscal decreased by  or approximately million  to million from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the lower interest rate on our million term loan  which was used to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of our 
senior notes the senior notes and  to a lesser extent  our lower debt level  as a result of the repurchase of million of our senior notes in december  and the million of term loan prepayments in fiscal  partially offset by higher average borrowings under our credit facility 
during fiscal  our average level of direct borrowings under our credit facility was million  but we did not have any direct borrowings under our credit facility as of september  during fiscal  our average level of direct borrowings under our credit facility was million 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
during fiscal  we prepaid million principal amount of our outstanding term loan 
the million term loan prepayments resulted in pretax charges totaling million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million principal amount of senior notes in december and  with the proceeds of a new term loan  we redeemed the remaining million principal amount of senior notes in april the million of senior note repurchases resulted in pretax charges totaling million in fiscal  representing the premium paid plus the write off of unamortized debt issuance discount and deferred financing costs

the average diluted shares outstanding of  shares for fiscal was higher than the  shares outstanding for fiscal the increase in average diluted shares outstanding reflects higher shares outstanding in fiscal compared to fiscal  as a result of stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock awards 
following is a reconciliation of net loss and net loss per share diluted to net income before restructuring and other charges  and loss on extinguishment of debt  and net income per share before restructuring and other charges  and loss on extinguishment of debt diluted for the years ended september  and in thousands  except per share amounts year ended september  year ended september  net income loss shares diluted eps net income loss shares diluted eps as reported restructuring and other charges  net of tax loss on extinguishment of debt  net of tax incremental shares from the assumed lapse of restrictions on restricted stock awards incremental shares from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options as adjusted before restructuring and other charges  and loss on extinguishment of debt liquidity and capital resources our cash needs have primarily been for i debt service  including prepayments  ii capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment for new stores  store relocations and expansions of our existing stores  as well as improvements and new equipment for our distribution and corporate facilities and information systems  and iii working capital  including inventory to support our business 
we have historically financed these capital requirements from cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities or available cash balances 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million during fiscal compared to an increase of million during fiscal cash provided by operations of million for fiscal increased by million from million for fiscal this increase in cash provided by operations versus the prior year was primarily the result of the net income before non cash goodwill impairment charges in fiscal as compared with a net loss in fiscal  and to a lesser extent  working capital changes that provided more cash in fiscal compared to fiscal the working capital changes were primarily i a slight increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current and non current liabilities in fiscal compared to a significant decrease in fiscal  and ii a decrease in other current assets in fiscal  which primarily reflected the receipt of a million federal income tax refund  partially offset by iii a slight decrease in trade accounts receivable in fiscal compared to a much larger decrease in fiscal  and iv a smaller decrease in inventories in fiscal compared to the fiscal decrease 
during fiscal we used cash provided by operations primarily to fund repayments of long term debt and to pay for capital expenditures 
our repayments of long term debt in fiscal consisted predominately of million of prepayments of our term loan  including a million prepayment required under the annual excess cash flow provision of the term loan 
for fiscal we spent million on capital expenditures  including million for leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment principally for new store facilities  as well as improvements to existing stores  and million for our information systems and distribution and corporate facilities 
cash provided by operations of million for fiscal increased by million from million for fiscal this increase in cash provided by operations versus the prior year was primarily the result of working capital changes that provided more cash in fiscal compared to  primarily due to a decrease in inventories in fiscal  partially offset by the larger net loss and smaller loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal compared to fiscal total inventories as of september  were million  a decrease of million or below the million inventories balance as of september  during fiscal we used the majority of our cash provided by operations to pay for capital expenditures 
for fiscal we spent million in capital expenditures  including million for leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment principally for new store facilities  as well as improvements to existing stores  and million for our information systems and distribution and corporate facilities 
we funded repayments of long term debt in fiscal  consisting predominately of million of prepayments of our term loan  by using the remaining cash provided by operations and the cash received from the grantor trust related to amendments to certain supplemental executive retirement agreements as described later in this section 
on december   we completed the repurchase of million principal amount of our senior notes at of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on april   we completed the redemption of the remaining million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes through our term loan financing 
the december and april redemptions of the senior notes  which were both at a price of of principal amount  plus accrued interest  resulted in loss on extinguishment of debt of million on a pretax basis  consisting of the million cash redemption premium and million of non cash expense from the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt issuance costs 
we have in place an agreement for a senior secured term loan b the term loan agreement  which matures on march   the proceeds of which were used to redeem the senior notes 
the interest rate on the term loan is equal to  at our election  either i the prime rate plus  or ii a libor rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings is either or  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined 
based upon our applicable quarterly consolidated leverage ratio during fiscal  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings remained at for fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal based upon our consolidated leverage ratio as of september   the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings will be effective for the second quarter of fiscal we are required to make minimum repayments of the principal amount of the term loan in quarterly installments of  each 
we are also required to make an annual principal repayment equal to or of excess cash flow as defined in excess of million for each fiscal year  with the or factor depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the effect of any non cash goodwill impairment charges is excluded from the calculation of excess cash flow under our term loan agreement 
the required principal repayment for fiscal  which was calculated based on the factor  is million and is due in december the required principal repayment for fiscal  which was calculated based on the factor  was million and was paid in december additionally  the term loan can be prepaid at our option  in part or in whole  at any time without any prepayment premium or penalty 
for fiscal we made the following prepayments million in the first quarter  including the million prepayment required under the annual excess cash flow provision of the term loan  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
for fiscal we made the following prepayments million in the second quarter and million in the third quarter 
at september   our indebtedness under the term loan agreement was million 
the term loan is secured by a security interest in our accounts receivable  inventory  real estate interests  letter of credit rights  cash  intangibles and certain other assets 
the security interest granted to the term lenders is  in certain respects  subordinate to the security interest granted to the credit facility lender 
the term loan agreement imposes certain restrictions on our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and enter into other various types of transactions 
the term loan agreement also contains quarterly financial covenants that require us to maintain a specified maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio and a specified minimum permitted consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined 
since the inception of the term loan agreement we have been in compliance with all covenants of our term loan agreement 
in order to mitigate our floating rate interest risk on the variable rate term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the agent bank for the term loan that commenced on april   the date the term loan proceeds were received  and expires on april  the interest rate swap agreement enables us to effectively convert an amount of the term loan equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swap from a floating interest rate of libor plus subject to reduction to libor plus if we achieve a specified leverage ratio  to a fixed interest rate of subject to reduction to if we achieve a specified leverage ratio for the significant majority of the term loan 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at the inception of the swap agreement and decreases over time to a notional amount of million at the expiration date 
the notional amount of the swap was million as of september  and over the next eighteen months decreases as follows to million starting october   to million starting april   and to million starting october  we also have in place a million revolving credit facility the credit facility  which matures on march  there are no financial covenant requirements under the credit facility provided that excess availability as defined does not fall below of the borrowing base as defined 
if excess availability were to fall below of the borrowing base  we would be required to meet a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined 
during all of fiscal and fiscal  we exceeded the minimum requirements for excess availability under the credit facility 
as of september   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and million in letters of credit  with million of availability under our credit line based on our borrowing base formula  compared to no outstanding borrowings and million in letters of credit  with million of availability under our credit line as of september  borrowings under the credit facility as of september  would have borne interest at a rate of between approximately and per annum 
during fiscal and  our average level of direct borrowings under the credit facility was million and million  respectively 
we expect that we will have borrowings under our credit facility during certain periods of fiscal  reflecting seasonal and other timing variations in cash flow 
in march  we entered into supplemental executive retirement agreements the serp agreements with our chairman of the board and former ceo and our president and chief creative officer the serp executives 
in april  we made an initial required contribution of million to a grantor trust  which was established for the purpose of accumulating assets in anticipation of our payment obligations under the serp agreements 
in november  we made an additional required contribution to the grantor trust of million 
in order to impact positively our ability to comply with the consolidated leverage ratio covenant of our term loan agreement at march   with the consent of the serp executives we withdrew million from the grantor trust on march  the withdrawn funds were used to repay indebtedness under our credit facility 
on may   we entered into i a letter agreement with the serp executives and the trustee for the grantor trust the trustee and ii an amendment to the grantor trust agreement with the trustee collectively  the agreements 
the agreements amended the serp agreements and the grantor trust agreement to provide for us to deliver an irrevocable standby letter of credit to the trustee in an amount equal to our then current funding obligation under the serp agreements  which was million 
as provided in the agreements  in the third quarter of fiscal we received a distribution of the remaining assets held in the grantor trust amounting to million 
the amendments affected by the agreements also allow for the issuance  from time to time  of irrevocable standby letters of credit  or the increase of size of an irrevocable standby letter of credit already held by the trustee  in lieu of any deposit to the grantor trust otherwise required in the future 
in addition  the agreements permit us  from time to time at our sole discretion  to reduce the size of any irrevocable standby letter of credit issued to the trustee  so long as we simultaneously fund the grantor trust with an amount of cash equal to the amount of the reduction of the letter of credit 
in october  we increased the irrevocable standby letter of credit issued to the trustee to a total of million  in lieu of deposits to the grantor trust  in connection with additional vesting of the serp executives benefits 
in april and july  we reduced the irrevocable standby letter of credit by million and million  respectively  to a total of million as of september   in connection with corresponding serp benefit payments made in april and july in november  we increased the irrevocable standby letter of credit by million to a total of million  in connection with additional vesting of the serp executives benefits 
our management believes that our current cash and working capital positions  expected operating cash flows and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and debt repayment requirements and to fund stock repurchases and or debt repayments  if any  for at least the next twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk destination maternity corporation is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
the range of changes presented reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
our cash equivalents consist of money market accounts that bear interest at variable rates 
a change in market interest rates earned on our investments impacts the interest income and cash flows  but does not materially impact the fair market value of the financial instruments 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio 
the impact on our future interest income resulting from changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio at that time 
however  based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience  we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income 
as of september   the principal components of our debt portfolio were the million term loan and the million credit facility  both of which are denominated in united states dollars 
our credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices 
as of september   we had no direct borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility would have resulted in interest at a rate between approximately and per annum as of september  any future borrowings under the credit facility would  to the extent of outstanding borrowings  be affected by changes in market interest rates 
a change in market interest rates on the variable rate portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest expense incurred and cash flows 
the term loan carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices 
the sensitivity analysis as it relates to this portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels as of september   with all other variables held constant 
the principal amount of the term loan was million as of september  a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense on the term loan of approximately million 
a basis point decline in market interest rates would correspondingly lower our annual interest expense on the term loan by approximately million 
in order to mitigate our floating rate interest risk on the variable rate term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the agent bank for the term loan that commenced on april  the interest rate swap agreement enables us to effectively convert an amount of the term loan equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swap from a floating interest rate libor plus  subject to reduction to libor plus if we achieve a specified leverage ratio  to a fixed interest rate  subject to reduction to if we achieve a specified leverage ratio 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at inception of the swap agreement and decreases over time to a notional amount of million at the expiration date 
the notional amount of the swap was million as of september  and over the next twelve months decreases as follows to million starting october   and to million starting april  based on the scheduled swap notional amount during the next months of the swap agreement  a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in interest expense savings for the year of approximately million related to the swap agreement 
a basis point decline in market interest rates would correspondingly increase our interest expense for the year by approximately million related to the swap agreement 
thus  a basis point increase in market interest rates during the next months of the swap agreement would result in additional interest expense for the year of approximately million on the term loan and swap agreement combined 
a basis point decline in market interest rates during the next months of the swap agreement would correspondingly lower our interest expense for the year by approximately million on the term loan and swap agreement combined 
based on the limited other variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio as of september   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in additional interest incurred for the year of less than million 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would correspondingly lower our interest expense for the year by less than million 
other than as described above  we do not believe that the market risk exposure on other financial instruments is material
