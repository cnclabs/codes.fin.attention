headquartered in avon lake  ohio  with sales of billion  we have manufacturing sites and distribution facilities in north america  europe and asia and joint ventures in north america and south america 
we currently employ approximately  people and offer more than  polymer solutions to over  customers across the globe 
we provide value to our customers through our ability to link our knowledge of polymers and formulation technology with our manufacturing and supply chain to provide an essential link between large chemical producers our raw material suppliers and designers  assemblers and processors of plastics our customers 
business model and key concepts the central focus of our business model is to provide specialized material and service solutions to our customers by leveraging our global footprint  product and technology breadth  manufacturing expertise  fully integrated information technology network  broad market reach and raw material procurement strength 
these resources enable us to capitalize on dynamic changes in the end markets we serve  which include appliances  building and construction materials  electrical and electronics  healthcare  industrial  packaging  transportation  and wire and cable markets 
key challenges overall  our business faces a number of issues resulting from the continued economic downturn  especially as it relates to critically affected markets such as building and construction and transportation 
improving profitability during periods of raw material price volatility is another critical challenge 
further  we need to capitalize on the opportunity to accelerate development of products that meet a growing body of environmental laws and regulations such as lead and phthalate restrictions inherent in the restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances rohs and the consumer product safety information act of polyone corporation 
table of contents strategy and key trends to address these challenges and achieve our vision  we have implemented a strategy with four core components specialization  globalization  operational excellence and commercial excellence 
specialization differentiates us through products  services  technology  and solutions that add value 
globalization takes us into growth markets to service our customers with consistency wherever their operations might be 
operational excellence empowers us to respond to the voice of the customer while focusing on continuous improvement 
commercial excellence enables us to deliver value to customers by supporting their growth and profitability 
in the short term  we are increasing our focus on improving working capital  preserving liquidity and increasing cash flow 
in addition to continuing to drive margin improvement  we have established working capital improvement targets for all businesses 
in  most of our capital expenditures will be focused on maintenance spending plus implementing the two restructuring initiatives previously announced and short payback projects of about a year or less 
these actions will ensure that we continue to invest in capabilities that advance the pace of our transformation but do not adversely impact our liquidity 
our other areas of focus are cost reductions  capacity reductions and ensuring we have right sized the business for current projected demand 
the two restructuring initiatives we have announced underscore this focus 
we are also deploying an enterprise wide lean six sigma program directed at improving profitability and cash flow by applying proven management techniques and strategies to key areas of the business  such as pricing  supply chain and operations management  productivity and quality 
long term trends that currently provide opportunities to leverage our strategy include the drive toward sustainability in polymers and their processing  the emergence of biodegradable and bio based polymers  consumer concern over the use of bisphenol a bpa in infant care products and developing legislation that bans lead and certain phthalates from toys and child care items 
recent developments pension plan changes on january   the chair of our compensation and governance committee  pursuant to authority delegated to him by our board of directors  approved and adopted changes to the geon pension plan geon plan  the benefit restoration plan brp  the voluntary retirement savings plan rsp and the supplemental retirement benefit plan srp 
effective march   the amendments to the geon plan and the brp permanently freeze future benefit accruals and provide that participants will not receive credit under the geon plan or the brp for any eligible earnings paid on or after that date 
all accrued benefits under the geon plan and the brp will remain intact  and service credits for vesting and retirement eligibility will continue in accordance with the terms of the geon plan and the brp 
the amendments to the rsp and srp provide that transition contributions under the rsp and the srp will be eliminated after march  these actions are expected to reduce our annual benefit expense by million and future pension fund contribution requirements by million 
restructuring initiatives and facility closures in july  we announced the restructuring of certain manufacturing assets  primarily in north america 
we are closing certain production facilities  including seven in north america and one in the united kingdom  resulting in a net reduction of approximately positions 
the production facilities closings are part of our focus on both the operational excellence and specialization component of our transformation strategy 
this realignment improves the competitiveness of our operations and supply chain across many product lines and businesses  consistent with current and anticipated customer requirements 
we expect to incur one time pre tax charges of approximately million related to these actions  of which million has been recorded during in total  these one time charges will include cash costs of approximately million related to severance and site closure costs with the remaining million of non cash costs related to asset write downs and accelerated depreciation  of which million has been recorded during we expect these actions will deliver pre tax savings of approximately million on an annualized run rate basis 
in january  we announced that we will enact further cost saving measures that include eliminating approximately jobs worldwide  implementing reduced work schedules for another to employees  closing our niagara  ontario facility and idling certain other capacity 
additionally  we are planning other actions that include freezing corporate officer salaries throughout we expect to incur one time pre tax charges of approximately million related to these actions  of which million has been recorded during the fourth quarter of in total  these one time charges include cash costs of approximately million related to severance and site closure costs with the remaining million of non cash costs related to asset write downs and accelerated depreciation 
we expect these actions will deliver pre tax savings of approximately million on an annualized run rate basis 
see note  employee separation and plant phaseout  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more detailed information related to these restructuring actions 
new banking relationship in november  we began transitioning various treasury management services from citicorp usa to bank of america

table of contents share repurchases in august  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us  depending upon market conditions and other factors  to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
during  we repurchased million shares of common stock under this program at an average price of per common share for approximately million 
there are million shares available for repurchase under the program at december  formation of polyone companies in japan and india in july  we formed polyone japan kabushiki kaisha polyone japan ltd the new company  which includes an office in tokyo staffed with a business development manager for japan  is focused on gaining specification with japanese original equipment manufacturers oems and importing products for use by japanese polymer processors 
during the same month  we established polyone polymers india pvt 
ltd 
to import  manufacture and sell polyone products in india and neighboring markets from new production and lab facilities located in mumbai 
this company provides us with strategic regional access to many large oems and polymer processors 
purchase of gls business in january  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of gls  the leading north american provider of tpe compounds for consumer  packaging and medical applications for a cash purchase price of million including acquisition costs and net of cash received 
the acquisition complements our global engineered materials business portfolio and accelerates our shift to specialization by combining gls s specialty tpe technology  compounding expertise and brands with our extensive global infrastructure and commercial presence 
development agreements signed several agreements with technology partners were signed in we established a market development agreement with eastman chemical company designating polyone as the exclusive compounder of filled systems with eastman s new generation tritan tm copolyester in north america 
we can now combine eastman tritan tm copolyester with performance enhancing additives to develop fully compounded systems that offer a bpa free alternative to polycarbonate

our tpe business completed an agreement with the dow chemical company to compound thermoplastic elastomer materials based on dow s infuse obc olefin block copolymers 
sustainability strategy defined during  we issued our sustainability promise and no surprises pledge sm to assure customers that we are dedicated to solutions that are environmentally responsible 
to further support this sustainability commitment  we defined a set of standards from which we established a family of products and services branded polyone sustainable solutions 
these brands meet criteria for renewability  recyclability  reusability  eco conscious composition and resource efficiency 
in september  we received the frost sullivan green excellence of the year award for our work in sustainability 
highlights and executive summary proved to be a volatile year for our company 
the year began with a sense that the us housing market would reach a bottom in late or early with the united states entering a mild recession  and europe and asia experiencing only a moderate economic slowdown 
during the first half of the year  raw material and energy costs rapidly escalated and in mid summer oil approached a high of nearly per barrel 
in july  we announced a manufacturing realignment to reduce capacity and headcount  primarily in north america 
around the same time  we saw the first signs of weakness in europe 
in september  credit markets came to a stand still as the us government searched for a solution to the banking crisis 
the financial markets reacted unfavorably to all of this news and sent equity markets to lows not seen since with this global economic backdrop  our customers immediately reduced demand 
in the fourth quarter of  our year over year sales declined million  or 
volume declined 
lower raw material costs offered some relief but were not enough to offset the significant declines in demand 
fourth quarter operating income was a loss of million which included a million goodwill impairment charge and a portion of the pre tax costs of a second restructuring initiative announced in january  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets by million 
the non cash charge to income tax expense consists of million related to us federal and state and local deferred tax assets and million related to foreign deferred tax assets 
million related to pension and post retirement health care liabilities was recorded as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income 
despite the challenging economic conditions  was a year of continuing progress in the transformation of polyone 
significant declines in demand required us to take aggressive actions that we had not planned at the outset of  however  the benefits of such actions will be significant in terms of their positive impact on our future profitability and attainment of our transformation goals 
selected financial data  a discussion of the aforementioned impact of these events on polyone  and a comparative review of performance in and versus prior years are provided below

aggregate sales increased million  or  in as compared to the acquisition of gls  favorable impact from foreign exchange and higher prices driven by an improved sales mix and the result of offsetting rising raw material and energy costs helped counterbalance the adverse impact of lower volume driven by a significant slowing in global economic activity in the late third quarter and the fourth quarter of this turndown in economic activity and the underlying financial credit crisis that precipitated it had a significant negative impact on our businesses  particularly the performance products and solutions segment 
the international color and engineered materials business  while benefiting from favorable foreign exchange rates  saw demand contract in the third quarter and then more dramatically in the fourth quarter of as the economies in europe and asia slowed and declining exports from asia offset any sales increase during the prior quarters in operating income declined by million driven by a million goodwill impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of  million of restructuring charges  and year over year declines in performance products and solutions and international color and engineered materials segment operating income 
the acquisition of gls  margin and mix improvements and the impact from foreign exchange were favorable items that partially offset the overall decrease 
the million decline in net income was due to the items described previously and the recording of a million tax valuation allowance 
see note  income taxes  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion 
liquidity declined million due to a lower available pool of receivables to borrow against and a year over year decline in cash and cash equivalents driven by a higher investment in working capital  pension funding  and lower dividends from our equity affiliates 
the increase in total debt resulted from the financing activities necessary to support the acquisition of gls 
vs 
aggregate sales increased million  or  in compared to this increase was primarily due to sales growth in asia  higher prices necessary to offset increased raw material and energy costs  and the impact of favorable exchange rates 
offsetting these favorable items was an and decline in sales in our specialty color  additives and inks  and performance products and solutions segments  respectively 
these declines were due mainly to the pruning of unprofitable business and the slowdown in the north american building and construction market 
operating income declined as a result of the impact of the slowdown in the north american building and construction and margin compression in our performance products and solutions and resin and intermediates segments 
in  we also recorded environmental remediation and impairment charges and legal settlements of million as compared to a benefit of million of similar items in the million increase in liquidity was driven by a larger eligible pool of receivables for securitization and an increase in cash and cash equivalents due to a year over year improvement in working capital of million  a favorable foreign exchange impact of million on cash  and the sales of assets 
the year over year decline in debt was primarily due to the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due at a premium of million 
this repurchase transaction was financed by the sale of our ownership interest in oxyvinyls in the third quarter of outlook update it appears that will be a challenging year as we project sales will fall below levels 
we expect continued economic weakness in the near term and accordingly we have taken actions to reduce capacity and costs 
in july of we announced our manufacturing realignment and the related closure of eight facilities 
as the economy has deteriorated further and the downturn extended internationally  we determined that another phase of cost reductions would be necessary to ensure that polyone remains competitive 
in january we announced those additional actions that included eliminating jobs worldwide  implementing reduced work schedules for another to employees based on demand  closing our niagara  ontario facility and idling certain other capacity 
additionally and among other actions  we have announced that we have frozen corporate officer salaries throughout and deferred other salary adjustments 
combined  the company expects all of the aforementioned actions will deliver pre tax savings of approximately million on an annualized run rate basis 
while we are not altering our four pillar strategy  our pace of investment in the business has slowed 
in  our focus will be on improving free cash flow and reducing working capital investment to preserve liquidity 
our capital expenditures will be focused on maintenance spending plus implementing the two restructuring initiatives previously described 
we have a very limited amount of immediate or near term debt payment obligations and our only immediate long term debt payment requirements are the medium term notes of which million is due in both and we expect pension plan expense to increase approximately million over due to a decline polyone corporation

table of contents our working capital management focus is on three metrics that we believe are the most critical to maximizing cash provided by operating activities 
these metrics measure the number of days of sales in receivables dso  the days of cost of goods sold in inventories dsi and the days of cost of goods sold in accounts payable dsp 
the following table presents a comparison of our average working capital metrics for  and in days accounts receivable dso inventories dsi accounts payable dsp average net days change in net days from prior year average average working capital as a percentage of sales in  average net days increased days primarily due to a higher investment in inventories particularly in the fourth quarter of when the rapid decline in the level of business activity outpaced inventory reduction programs 
overall  working capital as a percentage of sales increased one percentage point based on dynamics described above 
the average working capital metrics netted to a day improvement compared to driven by management s actions to improve dsp by initiating vendor terms management programs which offset higher inventories due to a slower demand outlook and a dso increase of days as customers slowed payments in light of a softening outlook for the economy 
the year end working capital metrics netted to an unfavorable increase of days compared to due to slower collections and higher inventories as compared to year end when weather issues in the us gulf coast created an unusually favorable impact on collections and inventory levels due to material shortages

this guarantee is secured by our inventories located in the united states

the credit agreement contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur liens  and various other customary provisions  including affirmative and negative covenants  and representations and warranties 
receivables sale facility the receivables sale facility was amended in june to extend the maturity to june and to among other things  modify certain financial covenants and reduce the cost of utilizing the facility 
in july  the receivable sale facility was amended to include up to million of canadian receivables  which increased the facility size to million 
the maximum proceeds that we may receive are limited to the lesser of million or of the eligible domestic and canadian accounts receivable sold 
this facility also makes up to million available for issuing standby letters of credit as a sub limit within the million facility  of which million was used at december  the facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio defined as adjusted ebitda less capital expenditures  divided by interest expense and scheduled debt repayments for the next four quarters of at least to when average excess availability under the facility is million or less 
notes receivable as of december   included in other non current assets is million outstanding on a seller note receivable due from excel polymers llc who purchased our elastomers and performance additives business in february this note accrues interest at and is due in full with accrued interest at maturity in july also included in other non current assets as of december  is million outstanding on a seller note receivable due to us from o sullivan films who purchased our engineered films business in august this note accrues interest at and is due in full with accrued interest at maturity in december concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  including foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements  along with trade accounts receivable and notes receivable  subject us to potential credit risk 
concentration of credit risk for trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers constituting our customer base and their distribution among many industries and geographic locations 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to notes receivable but we believe collection of the outstanding amounts is probable 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements in the event of non performance by the counter parties to these financial instruments 
we believe that the risk of incurring material losses related to this credit risk is remote 
we do not require collateral to support the financial position of our credit risks 
of the capital resource facilities available to us as of december   the portion of the receivables sale facility that was actually sold provided security for the transfer of ownership of these receivables 
each indenture governing our senior unsecured notes and debentures and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes allows a specific level of secured debt  above which security must be provided on each indenture and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes 
the receivables sale facility and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes are not considered debt under the covenants associated with our senior unsecured notes and debentures 
as of december   we had sold million of accounts receivable and had guaranteed million of our sunbelt equity affiliate s debt 
we expect that operations in will enable us to maintain existing levels of available capital resources and meet our cash requirements 
expected sources of cash in include cash from operations  additional borrowings under existing loan agreements that are not fully drawn  cash distributions from equity affiliates and proceeds from the sale of previously closed facilities and redundant assets 
expected uses of cash in include interest expense and discounts on the sale of accounts receivable  cash taxes  a contribution to a defined benefit pension plan  debt retirements  environmental remediation at inactive and formerly owned sites and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are currently estimated to be between million and million in  primarily to support and maintain manufacturing operations and restructuring actions 
we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future 
these market conditions may limit our ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to grow and maintain our business 
accordingly  we may be forced to delay raising capital  issue shorter tenors than we prefer or pay unattractive interest rates  which could increase our interest expense  decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility 
there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit 
based on current projections  we believe that we should be able to continue to manage and control working capital  discretionary spending and capital expenditures and that cash provided by operating activities  along with available borrowing capacity under polyone corporation

pfc and pfcc  in turn  sell an undivided interest in these accounts receivable to certain investors and realize proceeds of up to million 
the maximum proceeds that pfc and pfcc may receive under the facility is limited to the lesser of million or of the eligible domestic and canadian accounts receivable sold 
at december   pfc and pfcc had sold million of their undivided interests in accounts receivable 
we retained an interest in the million difference between the amount of trade receivables sold by us to pfc and pfcc and the undivided interests sold by pfc and pfcc 
as a result  this retained interest is included in accounts receivable on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  we believe that available funding under our receivables sale facility provides us increased flexibility to manage working capital requirements and is an important source of liquidity

pension and post retirement obligations relate to our us and international pension and other post retirement plans 
based upon our interpretation of the new pension regulations  there will be minimum funding requirements in of approximately million for our us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
obligations are based on the plans current funded status and actuarial assumptions  and include funding requirements projected to be made to our qualified pension plans  projected benefit payments to participants in our other post employment benefit plans  and projected benefit payments to participants in our non qualified pension plans through critical accounting policies and estimates significant accounting policies are described more fully in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors

  and r 
included in our results of operations are significant pension and post retirement benefit costs that we measure using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including assumptions about discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
these assumptions are updated at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  when making these assumptions 
changes in pension and post retirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the value of future assets and liabilities of our pension and post retirement plans 
it is difficult to predict these factors due to the volatility of market conditions 
to develop our discount rate  we consider the yields of high quality  fixed income investments with maturities that correspond to the timing of our benefit obligations 
to develop our expected return on plan assets  we consider our historical long term asset return experience  the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long term investment returns 
to develop our expected portfolio mix of plan assets  we consider the duration of the plan liabilities and give more weight to equity investments than to fixed income securities 
the rate of increase in health care costs that we assume for the next five years was held constant with prior years to reflect both our actual experience and projected expectations 
as of december   an increase decrease in the discount rate of  holding all other assumptions constant  would have increased or decreased accumulated other comprehensive income and the related pension and post retirement liability by approximately million 
the weighted average expected return on assets was for  and the expected return on assets is a long term assumption whose accuracy can only be measured over a long period based on past experience 
a variation in the expected return on assets by as of december  would result in a variation of approximately million in the net periodic benefit cost 
holding all other assumptions constant  a increase or decrease in the health care cost trend rate would have increased or decreased our net periodic benefit cost by million and our accumulated other comprehensive income and the related post retirement liability by approximately million as of december  polyone corporation 
table of contents effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we follow the guidance in fasb statement no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and test goodwill for impairment at least annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of the first day of october of each year 
the carrying value of goodwill at december  was million 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach  which requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding projected economic and market conditions  growth rates  operating margins and cash expenditures 
we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of the first day of july and we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to our share of a write down of goodwill of an equity affiliate 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
as a result of our change in timing of the annual impairment testing to be as of the first day of october prospectively  we reperformed the goodwill impairment test as of october and determined that no additional goodwill impairment existed 
during the fourth quarter of  indicators of potential impairment caused us to conduct an interim impairment test 
those indicators included the following a significant decrease in market capitalization  a decline in recent operating results  and a decline in our business outlook primarily due to the macroeconomic environment 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 we completed step one of the impairment analysis and concluded that  as of december   the fair value of two of our reporting units was below their respective carrying values  including goodwill 
the two reporting units that showed potential impairment were geon compounds and specialty coatings reporting units within performance products and solutions 
as such  step two of the impairment test was initiated in accordance with fasb statement no 
due to its time consuming nature  the step two analysis has not been completed as of the date of this filing 
in accordance with paragraph of statement no 
 we have recorded an estimate in the amount of million as a non cash goodwill impairment charge as of december  we expect to complete the step two analysis during the first quarter of if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges 
at december   we have million of indefinite lived intangibles consisting of a trade name acquired as part of the january acquisition of gls 
we have estimated the fair value of the tradename using a relief from royalty payments approach 
this approach involves two steps estimating reasonable royalty rate for the tradename and applying this royalty rate to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
fair value is then compared with the carrying value of the tradename 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to intangible impairment charges polyone corporation 
table of contents effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in addition  deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets is not deemed to be more likely than not 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate recovery of certain of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income that we will ultimately generate in the future and other factors such as the interpretation of tax laws 
this means that significant estimates and judgments are required to determine the extent that valuation allowances should be provided against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances as of december  aggregating million against such assets based on our current assessment of future operating results and these other factors 
although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  which could result in gains or losses that could be material 
we recognize net tax benefits under the recognition and measurement criteria of fin  which prescribes requirements and other guidance for financial statement recognition and measurement of positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns 
we record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
environmental liabilities based upon estimates prepared by our environmental engineers and consultants  we have million accrued at december  to cover probable future environmental remediation expenditures 
this accrual represents our best estimate of the remaining probable remediation costs based upon information and technology currently available and our view of the most likely remedy 
depending upon the results of future testing  the ultimate remediation alternatives undertaken  changes in regulations  new information  newly discovered conditions and other factors  it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs in excess of the amount accrued 
however  such additional costs  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
our estimate of this liability may be revised as new regulations or technologies are developed or additional information is obtained 
changes during the past five years have primarily resulted from an increase in the estimate of future remediation costs at existing sites and payments made each year for remediation costs that were already accrued 
if further developments or resolution of these matters are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period

option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  future employee turnover rates and risk free rate of return

under these arrangements  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts on agreed upon notional principal amounts 
on december   we terminated an interest rate swap that fixed the floating rate on million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility at an effective rate of 
this swap was originally scheduled to expire on january  at december   there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we maintained interest rate swap agreements on five of our fixed rate obligations in the aggregate amount of million with a net fair value liability of million 
at december   we maintained interest rate swap agreements on six of our fixed rate obligations in the aggregate amount of million with a net fair value liability of million 
the weighted average interest rate for these agreements was at december  during january  four of these interest rate swap agreements in the aggregate amount of million were terminated 
foreign currency exposure we enter into intercompany lending transactions that are denominated in various foreign currencies and are subject to financial exposure from foreign exchange rate movement from the date a loan is recorded to the date it is settled or revalued 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are not treated as hedges and  as a result  are marked to market  with the resulting gains and losses recognized as other income or expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
gains and losses on these contracts generally offset gains or losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at december  and  these agreements had a fair value of million and million  respectively 
the estimated potential effect on the fair values of these foreign exchange contracts  outstanding as of december   given a change in exchange rates would be a million impact to pre tax income 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
for more information about our foreign currency exposure  see note  financial instruments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we face translation risks related to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
net sales and expenses in our foreign operations foreign currencies are translated into varying amounts of us dollars depending upon whether the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our net sales and expenses from foreign operations as expressed in us dollars
