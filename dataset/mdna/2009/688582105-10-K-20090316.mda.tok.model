item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we believe we are a leading technology company that develops innovative and efficacious products for regenerative medicine focusing on biologic solutions 
we are focused on creating innovative technology platforms that will provide us with a variety of procedural specific biologic products to address the changing needs of orthopedics and healthcare in general 
by developing specific products for specific procedures  we believe we will be able to provide the surgeon with the right product at the right time for the right procedure and therefore improve patient outcomes 
we are currently focused on three technologies magnifuse  plexur and collagen 
each of these technologies have generated and will continue to generate a variety of procedural specific products allowing us to expand our business into new markets and surgical procedures as well as allowing us to provide surgeons with more efficacious products in the markets in which we currently compete 
our grafton technology  which is in use today  is extensively utilized in our grafton dbm line of products as well as 
table of contents with our more recently developed technologies 
these technology platforms represent the majority of our revenue  provide the opportunity to expand into new markets and we believe will drive our future growth 
our business is to alleviate pain  promote healing and restore function by developing innovative biologic solutions for regenerative medicine 
our goal is to utilize our current and future technology platforms to develop tissue forms and products collectively referred to herein as products to create procedure specific solutions to repair  replace or heal bone and tissue loss caused by trauma  disease or surgical intervention  augment prosthetic implant procedures  facilitate spinal fusion and replace and or repair damaged ligaments  tendons and other tissues within the human body 
we expect to achieve this objective by executing on three main initiatives development of innovative technologies  utilization of these technologies to create efficacious products for specific surgical procedural applications and medical education 
we provide our biologic solutions to orthopedic  spinal  trauma  neurosurgical and oral maxillofacial surgeons for use in the various surgical procedures 
during  we accomplished certain milestones as we continued to transform the company to one that provides to the medical profession procedure specific biological solutions as follows in december  we initiated a pivotal clinical trial for our duratech bioregeneration matrix 
duratech is the first of several products under development based upon our proprietary human collagen technology platform 
we expect to file a k with the fda to secure marketing clearance for duratech in the third quarter of in october  we received fda clearance for our next generation grafting material  magnifuse bone graft 
magnifuse will provide a range of market opportunities with products specifically designed for use in posterolateral spine  deformity and minimally invasive procedures 
in may  we announced our plexur technology was to be used in the craniofacial reconstruction program funded by the armed forces institute of regenerative medicine 
in april  we received fda clearance to market our plexur p biocomposite in spinal applications 
plexur p is a porous  resilient scaffold that allows for the rapid absorption and retention of cells to facilitate bone growth 
in march and july of  we received fda clearances for our plexur m biocomposite for application in the pelvis  extremities and spine 
plexur m is a uniquely moldable  settable biomaterial  which  when heated  gives surgeons the ability to contour the product into almost any shape

revenue from grafton dbm  private label dbm and xpanse bone inserts changed  and  respectively  in compared to revenue from grafton dbm was negatively impacted in as a result of a decline in average selling prices 
the decline in private label revenue was primarily due to one of our private label dbm customers formally notifying us of their decision not to renew its current agreement with us upon the agreement s expiration in march we recognized million of revenue from this customer in the first quarter of and the customer has not made any purchases since 
revenue in our hybrid synthetic segment  which reflects sales of our plexur p biocomposite and graftcage spacers  increased for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of a increase in plexur p revenue due to increased unit volume 
we do not anticipate revenue from the distribution of the graftcage spacers to be a significant contributor to our future revenue stream 
revenue in our traditional tissue segment  which represents the worldwide distribution of allograft bone tissue grafts  increased in as compared to the increase in traditional tissue revenue resulted from increased unit sales volume  especially in the international market

table of contents income tax provision in and  after the application of available net operating loss carryforwards  we provided for federal income taxes based on the alternative minimum tax method  as well as a provision for certain state taxes on alternative methods and foreign taxes 
the carryforwards utilized for federal  state and foreign purposes carried full valuation allowances 
in  we also recorded a charge for estimated penalties and interest related to our assessment of uncertain tax positions mainly as a result of an ongoing federal tax audit 
our state income tax benefit in was primarily due to the reversal of certain domestic state tax reserves and the filing for a state tax refund related to a prior year  partially offset by a provision for minimum state taxes in certain jurisdictions 
we have evaluated the continuing need for our valuation allowances for our domestic and foreign deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  and we have determined based on our assessment that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of such valuation allowances 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of such valuation allowances 
we evaluate our position with respect to the valuation allowances each quarter by taking into consideration numerous factors  including  but not limited to past  present and forecasted results  the impact in each jurisdiction of operating activities  and the anticipated effects of our strategic plan 
in  we provided an income tax benefit primarily due to the reversal of certain domestic state tax reserves  which were no longer required  partially offset by provisions for minimum state income taxes 
no provision for federal or foreign taxes was recorded due to the availability of prior year net operating loss carryforwards  which carried a full valuation allowance  or due to recognizing a current year taxable loss for which any tax benefits or assets would be fully offset by the establishment of valuation allowances 
we file us  state  and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal  foreign and most state authorities including  but not limited to  the united states  france  bulgaria and the state of new jersey 
our through federal tax returns are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs and the state of new jersey is examining certain of our to state tax filings 
we have recently been advised of an audit of the and tax filings by our french subsidiary 
we are currently working with the irs to complete and resolve their tax examination  which is subject to review and approval by the joint committee on taxation 
we anticipate we will owe no additional tax and the aggregate amount of our available federal net operating loss carryforwards will not be materially impacted 
any remaining items disallowed would be deductible in future periods 
until such time as the joint committee on taxation approval is received  the irs examination will not be considered effectively settled for financial reporting purposes 
upon our adoption of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  effective january   we had no material liability for unrecognized tax benefits utbs 
the components of our utbs are substantially comprised of deferred tax assets which are subject to a full valuation 
table of contents allowance 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which either a receivable or a liability for a utb has been established  or are required to pay an amount or utilize nols to settle a tax liability  or estimates regarding a specific utb change  our effective tax rate in a given financial reporting period may be affected 
during the year ended december   the total amount of our utbs declined million to million 
at december   the reduction in net federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets of million as a result of utbs was offset by a similar change in the related valuation allowance 
we expect that the amount will change in the next twelve months due to our filing of amended federal and state tax returns  expiring statutes of limitation  and audit activity 
however  we do not anticipate the change to be significant 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  working capital declined to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to the use of a portion of available cash to invest in additional tissue inventories of million and for capital expenditures of million 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million provided by operating activities in the prior year 
the decrease resulted primarily from an increased investment in tissue inventories of million partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activity principally relates to the funding of capital expenditures  including the implementation of a new enterprise software system  and for production equipment and facilities for new products 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities of million in the year ended december  relates primarily to principal payments on our capital lease obligation of million  our purchase of our own common stock under a repurchase program approved by our board of directors in december  partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
in  proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan were partially offset by payments on our capital lease obligation resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of million 

table of contents repurchase of common stock in december  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to million of shares of our common stock may be acquired 
stock repurchases may be executed from time to time at current market prices through open market and privately negotiated transactions in such amounts as management deems appropriate 
the final number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors  including the level of our cash and cash equivalents  price  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions 
the repurchase program may be terminated at any time without prior notice 
further liquidity and financing needs as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
in  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations  which will be utilized in conjunction with our cash reserves  to fund capital expenditures of approximately million  principal payments on our capital lease obligation and to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 
assuming we are able to achieve our projections for  we anticipate our year end cash reserves to be approximately million 
to be successful in generating positive cash flow from operations  it will be extremely important that we effectively manage the key aspects of our working capital  especially our tissue inventories 
if we are unsuccessful in managing the components of our working capital  then we will consume more of our cash reserves than we had anticipated 
based on our current projections and estimates  we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals  if any  which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products  and our ability to effectively manage the key components of working capital  especially processed and unprocessed tissue inventories 
we may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plans 
we can provide no assurance that such additional funds will be available or  if available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are materially likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates and may adjust them based upon the latest information available 
these estimates generally include those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories including purchase commitments  deferred processing costs including reserves for rework  excess and obsolescence  long lived assets  asset retirement obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we record reductions to revenue for estimated returns based upon historical experience 
if future returns are less than historical experience  a reduction in estimated reserves would increase revenue 
alternatively  should returns exceed historical experience  additional allowances would be required  which would reduce revenue 
historically  the amount of returns has not been material 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in estimates of collection risk related to accounts receivable can result in decreases or increases in current period operating costs 
we write down inventory and deferred processing costs for estimated excess  obsolescence or unmarketable tissue grafts and products equal to the lower of cost or market value 
excess and obsolescence could occur from numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive nature of the market  technological change  expiration and changes in surgeon preference 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required  including provisions to reduce inventory and deferred processing costs to net realizable value 
in each period  we also assess our production activity in relationship to historical experience and normal capacity  and evaluate the need to reflect processing costs as either period costs or as a component of deferred processing costs 
in periods where our actual process activities are less than historical experience and deemed abnormal  we charge an appropriate portion of our processing costs directly to cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we provide reserves  if any  for the difference between our contractual purchase commitments and our projected purchasing patterns based upon maintenance of adequate inventory levels and forecasted revenues 
if actual revenue is less favorable than those forecasted by management  additional reserves may be required  alternatively  if revenue is stronger than forecasted by management  such reserves would be reduced 
we continually monitor events and circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including property  plant  equipment and intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess recoverability of long lived assets  other than goodwill  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset  or discounted estimated future cash flows if fair value is not readily determinable 
goodwill is tested for impairment  based initially on discounted cash flows  on an annual basis as of january  and between annual tests if indicators or potential impairment exist 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance and economic conditions 

table of contents we record an asset retirement obligation when an obligation to retire an asset is determined 
the asset retirement obligation is accrued at its estimated fair value with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  if appropriate 
we determine the amount of the asset retirement obligation based upon a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment and make adjustments to the asset retirement obligation recorded based on the passage of time or revisions to either the timing or the amount of the undiscounted cost estimate to retire the asset 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  in the event that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we accrue current and future tax liabilities based upon levels of taxable income  tax planning strategies  and assessments of the timing of taxability of the tax attributes 
we provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award  which is recognized as an expense generally on a straight line basis over the employee s or consultant s requisite service period with an equal amount recorded as additional paid in capital  net of income tax benefit  if any  until such time as the fair value has been fully recognized 
we account for forfeitures using an estimated rate when determining the fair value of the award 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and management is unable to predict the outcome of pending litigation 
when we are reasonably able to determine the probable minimum or ultimate liability  if any  which may result from any of the pending litigation  we will record a provision for our best estimate of such liability  and if appropriate  will record a benefit for the amounts covered by insurance 
if the outcome or resolution of the pending litigation is for amounts greater than accrued  an expense will be recorded in the period the determination is made 
alternatively  should the outcome or resolution be for less than accrued  we would reduce the expense in the period the determination is made

valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the following three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value  of which  the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities

eitf is effective for us beginning january  and requires retrospective application for arrangements existing as of the effective date 
eitf  among other things  defines the meaning of collaborative arrangements and defines how costs incurred and revenues generated should be reported 
the effect of the adoption of eitf on our financial position and results of operations is not expected to be material 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation 
we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations for material changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
as our foreign source revenue continues to grow and represent a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues and profits  foreign currency translation adjustments may impact our operating results to a greater extent 
during  the us dollar fluctuated significantly versus the euro especially during the last quarter of the year 
at december   the us dollar closed above the prior year end level 
however  the average exchange rate for the year was effectively equal to the closing rate at december  as a result of the timing of our various transactions denominated in euros  our foreign exchange gains or losses were insignificant in in and  we recognized foreign currency losses  primarily related to the impact of exchange rates on intercompany indebtedness  of million and million  respectively 
foreign currency gains  which primarily relate to the impact of exchange rates on intercompany indebtedness  were million in litigation we are involved in legal proceedings involving product liability claims 
for a complete discussion of these matters  see item  legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits 
government proceedings in december  we were advised that during a november inspection of donor recovery sites in bulgaria by the french regulatory agency afssaps  deficiencies were identified 
as a precautionary measure  we have temporarily suspended the distribution of allograft tissue grafts processed from tissue recovered by our subsidiary  tb osteocentre bulgaria ead ocbg 
in addition  in cooperation with afssaps  we have recalled unused ocbg related tissue grafts previously distributed in france 
these actions are not due to product contamination or to any deficiencies with the tissue grafts 
ocbg related allograft tissue grafts are not distributed in the united states 
we continue to work with afssaps and other international 
table of contents regulatory bodies in order for us to resolve the deficiencies noted and lift our self imposed suspension of shipments 
ultimately  we believe we will be able to successfully resolve these matters and lift the suspension although no assurance can be given that we will be successful in our efforts 
at december   we had approximately million in tissue product subject to our self imposed suspension of shipments 
in our opinion  the actions of afssaps will not have a material impact on our long term results of operations or financial position 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that may include statements regarding intent  belief or current expectations of osteotech and our management 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
we desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions 
accordingly  we have identified in item a of this form k important risk factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications  or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our officers and agents 
we do not intend to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform them to actual results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents 
we do not enter into derivative transactions related to our cash or cash equivalents 
accordingly  we are subject to changes in interest rates 
based on our december  cash and cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would impact net income by approximately million 
credit risks during the year ended december   we sold our products to hospitals in the united states and to stocking distributors internationally 
stocking distributors in turn sell to hospitals or other medical establishments and  in many instances  individual stocking distributors maintain higher individual balances with longer payment terms 
at december  and  international stocking distributors accounted for of our accounts receivable 
loss  termination or changes in financial condition of a distributor  as well as a change in medical reimbursement regimens by foreign governments where our products are sold  along with changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate or changes in local currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  in international countries where our distributors operate  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
foreign exchange risks generally  sales to international stocking distributors are denominated in us dollars 
however  in certain instances  we invoice in currencies other than us dollars and also  to a 
table of contents lesser extent  make purchases denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
we therefore are exposed to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  which we do not hedge  and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component of other income in the determination of net income 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates  while related revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month in which related transactions occur 
translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to stockholders equity and included in other comprehensive income 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance
