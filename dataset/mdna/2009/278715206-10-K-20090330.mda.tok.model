table of contents application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as promulgated in the united states  requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition and therefore we consider revenue earned and realizable when a persuasive evidence of the sales arrangement exists  provided that the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  b delivery or performance has occurred  c customer acceptance has been received  if contractually required  and  d collectability of the arrangement fee is probable 
the company typically uses signed contractual agreements as persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the license of software where the software deliverables are considered more than inconsequential to the other elements in the arrangement 
for contracts that contain multiple deliverables  we analyze the revenue arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  individual contractual deliverables are accounted for separately if a the delivered items has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  b there is vendor specific objective and reliable evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered items  and  c if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control 
software development arrangements involving significant customization  modification or production are accounted for in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance on construction type and certain production type contracts  sop using the percentage of completion method 
the company recognizes revenue using periodic reported actual hours worked as a percentage of total expected hours required to complete the project arrangement and applies the percentage to the total arrangement fee 
the company begins to recognize revenue from license fees for its application software products upon delivery and the customer s acceptance of the software implementation and customizations if applicable 
revenue from third party software is derived from the licensing of third party software products in connection with sales of the company s software licenses and is recognized upon delivery together with the company s licensed software products 
training  data conversion  installation  and consulting services fees are recognized as revenue when the services are performed

valuation of goodwill the company applies the provisions of financial accounting statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas which addresses how goodwill and other acquired intangible assets should be accounted for in financial statements 
in this regard we test these intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment are present 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
the testing involves comparing the reporting unit and asset carrying values to their respective fair values  we determine fair value by using the present value of future estimated net cash flows 
in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment  we use projections of future discounted cash flows to determine each reporting unit s fair value 
these projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
our estimates of fair value for each reporting unit are corroborated by market multiple comparables 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our projected discounted cash flows eg  growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge 
during the twelve months ended december   and  we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances 
for additional information about goodwill  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in this regard a valuation allowance is currently set against our accumulated domestic net operating loss carryforwards because we believe it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset may not be realizable due to uncertainty as future taxable income and the lack of feasible tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowance  and estimated future taxable income 
the company has not provided deferred us taxes on its unremitted foreign earnings because it considers them to be permanently re invested 
we currently maintain a full valuation allowance against the company s accumulated domestic net operating loss carryforwards because management believes it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset may not be realizable due to uncertainty as to the generation of future taxable income in the united states and the lack of feasible tax planning strategies 
effective january the company adopted the financial accounting interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon final settlement 
the company adopted fin during and as a result recognized a thousand liability for unrecognized tax benefits of which thousand was accounted for as a reduction to the january   balance of retained earnings
