item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our k are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative therapies that target the molecular mechanisms that cause cancer 
with our collaborators  we are developing anticancer therapies with the goal of changing the way cancer is treated tm 
we are applying our expertise to develop and commercialize therapies designed to exploit the genetic differences between cancer cells and normal cells 
our first commercially available product  nexavar sorafenib tablets  being developed with our collaborator  bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc  or bayer  is approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of patients with advanced kidney cancer and liver cancer 
nexavar is a novel  orally available kinase inhibitor and is one of a new class of anticancer treatments that target both cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth through the inhibition of key signaling pathways 
in december  nexavar became the first newly approved drug for patients with advanced kidney cancer in over a decade 
in november  nexavar was approved as the first and is currently the only systemic therapy for the treatment of patients with liver cancer 
nexavar is now approved in more than countries for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and in more than countries for the treatment of liver cancer 
we and bayer are also conducting clinical trials of nexavar in several important cancer types in addition to advanced kidney cancer and liver cancer  including lung  melanoma  breast  ovarian and colon cancers 
we and bayer are commercializing nexavar  for the treatment of patients with advanced kidney cancer and liver cancer 
nexavar has been approved and is marketed for these indications in the united states and in the european union  as well as other territories worldwide 
in the united states  we co promote nexavar with bayer 
outside of the united states  bayer manages all commercialization activities 
in  worldwide net sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer were million 

table of contents in collaboration with bayer  we initially focused on demonstrating nexavar s ability to benefit patients suffering from a cancer for which there were no or few established therapies 
with the approval of nexavar for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and liver cancer  the two companies have established the nexavar brand and created a global commercial oncology presence 
in order to benefit as many patients as possible  we and bayer are investigating the administration of nexavar with previously approved anticancer therapies in more common cancers  with the objective of enhancing the anti tumor activity of existing therapies through combination with nexavar 
we and bayer are developing and marketing nexavar under our collaboration and co promotion agreements 
we fund of the development costs for nexavar worldwide  excluding japan 
with bayer  we co promote nexavar in the united states and share equally in any profits or losses 
outside of the united states  excluding japan  bayer has exclusive marketing rights and we share profits equally 
in japan  bayer funds all product development  and we will receive a royalty on any sales 
our agreements with bayer also provide that we receive creditable milestone based payments totaling million  all of which have been received 
these payments are repayable by us to bayer from a portion of our share of any quarterly collaboration profits and royalties after deducting certain contractually agreed upon expenditures 
as of december   million of this amount was paid back to bayer based on the profitability of the collaboration thus far 
we have expanded our development pipeline through the acquisition of rights to development stage novel anticancer agents 
in november  we entered into an agreement to license worldwide development and commercialization rights to onx  previously known as bgc  from btg international limited  or btg  a london based specialty pharmaceuticals company 
onx is in preclinical development and is believed to work by combining two established approaches to improve outcomes for cancer patients  selectively targeting tumor cells through the alpha folate receptor  which is overexpressed in a number of tumor types  and inhibiting thymidylate synthase  a key enzyme responsible for cell growth and division 
in december  we acquired options to license sb designated by onyx as onx and sb designated by onyx as onx  which are both janus kinase  or jak  inhibitors  from s bio pte ltd  or s bio  a singapore based company 
the activation of jak stimulates blood cell production and the jak pathway is known to play a critical role in the proliferation of certain types of cancer cells and in the anti inflammatory pathway 
onx is in multiple phase studies and onx is in preclinical development 
with the exception of the year ended december   we have incurred net losses since our inception 
our ability to achieve continued and sustainable profitability is uncertain and is dependent on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the level of patient demand for nexavar  the ability of bayer s distribution network to process and ship product on a timely basis  investments in sales and marketing efforts to support the sales of nexavar  bayer and our investments in the research and development of nexavar  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and expenditures we may incur to acquire or develop and commercialize additional products 
our operating results will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and are difficult to predict 
since inception  we have relied on public and private financings  combined with milestone payments from our collaborators  to fund our operations and may continue to do so in future periods 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our development efforts  the results of the nexavar clinical trials  the marketing of nexavar as a treatment for patients in approved indications  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
for a discussion of these and some of the other risks and uncertainties affecting our business  see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we consider 
table of contents certain accounting policies related to revenue from collaboration agreement  fair value of marketable securities  stock based compensation  research and development expenses and the use of estimates to be critical policies 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant estimates used in included assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of marketable securities  stock based compensation related to stock options granted  revenue from collaboration agreement and research and development expenses 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue from collaboration agreement on december   the financial accounting standards board or fasb  ratified emerging issues task force  or eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangements 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and shall be applied retrospectively for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we have elected to early adopt eitf  as a result  effective january   our statement of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation 
as the commercial sales of nexavar began in late december  there is no impact to periods prior to january  this new presentation impacts the classification of amounts included in specific line items  but has no impact on net income loss or net income loss per share 
as a result of this new presentation  the statement of operations now includes the line item revenue from collaboration agreement 
this line item consists of our share of the pre tax commercial profit generated from the collaboration with bayer  reimbursement of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue 
our portion of shared collaboration research and development expenses is not included in the line item revenue from collaboration agreement  but is reflected under operating expenses 
according to the terms of the collaboration agreement  the companies share all research and development  marketing  and non us sales expenses 
we and bayer each bear our own us sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these costs related to our us sales force and medical science liaisons are recorded in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
bayer recognizes all revenue under the nexavar collaboration and incurs the majority of expenses relating to the development and marketing of nexavar 
we are highly dependent on bayer for timely and accurate information regarding any revenues realized from sales of nexavar and the costs incurred in developing and selling it  in order to accurately report our results of operations 
if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods and may be required to restate our results for prior periods 
see note of the accompanying footnotes to the financial statements for the effect of the adoption of eitf for all periods presented 
fair value of marketable securities effective january   we adopted the provisions of statements of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
 which defines fair value and provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
in accordance with sfas no 
and fas staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
 we adopted sfas no 
with regard to all financial assets and liabilities in our financial statements in the first quarter of and have elected to delay the adoption of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities until the first quarter of sfas no 
is applicable whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
accordingly  the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments  including cash equivalents and marketable securities  continue to be valued at fair value on a recurring basis 
as defined in sfas no 
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing assets  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 

table of contents sfas no 
describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value  as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
sfas no 
introduced new disclosures about how we value certain assets 
much of the disclosure focuses on the inputs used to measure fair value  particularly in instances in which the measurement uses significant unobservable inputs 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payments made to employees and directors including employee stock option awards and employee stock purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  based on estimated fair value 
we previously applied the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method beginning january  accordingly  during the year ended december   we recorded stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january  as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under sfas were in effect for expense recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
for these awards  the company has continued to recognize compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
for stock based awards granted after january   we recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under sfas r 
the compensation expense for these awards was recognized using a straight line amortization method 
the net income for the year ended december  includes employee stock based compensation expense of million  or per diluted share 
the net loss for the years ended december  and includes employee stock based compensation expense of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
as of december   the total unrecorded stock based compensation expense for unvested stock options  net of expected forfeitures  was million  which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
on november   the fasb  issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects  if any  of stock based compensation expense pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact to the apic pool and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including  but not limited to  stock price volatility and stock option exercise behavior 
we expect to continue to use the black scholes model for valuing our stock based compensation expense 
however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense will be affected by a number of items including our stock price  the number of stock options our board of directors may grant in future periods  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation adjustments and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price  expected life and stock option exercise behaviors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

table of contents research and development expense in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
 accounting for research and development costs  research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  non refundable upfront payments  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
non refundable option payments  including those made under our agreement with s bio  that do not have any future alternative use are recorded as research and development expense 
not all research and development costs are incurred by us 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses  approximately in  in and in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
as a result of the cost sharing arrangement between us and bayer  there was a net reimbursable amount of million  million and million to bayer for the years ended december   and  respectively 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and estimates we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
if we underestimate or overestimate the amounts owed to bayer  we may need to adjust these amounts in a future period  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials and other consulting activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites  cooperative groups and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could be required to record significant additional research and development expenses in future periods 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes as required by fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which clarifies the criteria that must be met prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit of a position taken in a tax return 
fin provides a benefit recognition model with a two step approach consisting of a more likely than not recognition criteria  and a measurement attribute that measures a given tax position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also requires the recognition of liabilities created by differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective as of the beginning of the first annual period beginning after december   and became effective for us on january  the adoption of fin had no impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows for the year ended december   as the we had no unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents we have accumulated approximately million in net operating losses  which equates to approximately million in deferred tax assets  relating to us federal and state income taxes through december  the federal net operating losses  which we can use to offset future federal taxable income  expire between the years and  and the state net operating loss  which we can use to offset future state taxable income expire between the years and however  utilization of the net operating losses may be limited under us internal revenue code section and our ability to generate net income before they expire 
we have also accumulated approximately an additional million in other deferred tax assets based on temporary differences between book and tax reporting 
we continue to fully reserve our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets despite achieving full year profitability in  since we have had a history of losses since inception 
we will consider reversing a significant portion of the valuation reserve once we have demonstrated sustained profitability and our internal forecasts support the utilization of the net operating losses prior to their expiration 
if we determine that the reversal of a significant portion of the valuation reserve is appropriate  a significant one time benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of the reversal 
in addition  as of december   approximately million of the deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses consists of deductions for employee stock options for which the tax benefit will be credited to additional paid in capital if and when realized 
we assess the appropriateness of the valuation allowance at the end of each reporting period 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
nexavar  our only marketed product  was approved in the united states in december in accordance with our collaboration agreement with bayer  bayer recognizes all revenue from the sale of nexavar 
as such  for the years ended december   and  we reported no revenue related to nexavar 
nexavar net sales as recorded by bayer were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily from sales in the united states and the european union 
revenue from collaboration agreement 
nexavar is currently marketed and sold in more than countries for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and in more than countries for the treatment of liver cancer 
we co promote nexavar in the united states with bayer under collaboration and co promotion agreements 
in march  we and bayer entered into a co promotion agreement to co promote nexavar in the united states 
this agreement amends the collaboration agreement and supersedes the provisions of that agreement that relate to the co promotion of nexavar in the united states 
outside of the united states  the terms of the collaboration agreement continue to govern 
under the terms of the co promotion agreement and consistent with the collaboration agreement  we and bayer share equally in the profits or losses of nexavar  if any  in the united states  subject only to our continued co funding of the development costs of nexavar worldwide outside of japan and our continued co promotion of nexavar in the united states 
the collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement  not through a joint venture or other legal entity 
outside of the united states  excluding japan  bayer incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures  and we reimburse bayer for half of those expenditures 
in addition  for sales generated outside of the united states  excluding japan  we reimburse bayer a fixed percentage of sales for their marketing infrastructure 
research and development expenditures on a worldwide basis  excluding japan  are equally shared by both companies regardless of whether we or bayer incurs the expense 
in japan  bayer is responsible for all development and marketing costs and we receive a royalty on net sales of nexavar 
in the united sates  bayer provides all product distribution and all marketing support services for nexavar  including managed care  customer service  order entry and billing 
we compensate bayer for distribution expenses based on a fixed percentage of gross sales of nexavar in the united states 
we reimburse bayer for half of its expenses for marketing services provided by bayer for the sale of nexavar in the united states 
we and bayer share equally in any other out of pocket marketing expenses other than expenses for sales force and medical science liaisons that we and bayer incur in connection with the marketing and promotion of nexavar in the united states 
bayer manufactures all nexavar sold and is reimbursed at an agreed transfer price per unit for the cost of goods sold in the united states 

table of contents in the united states  we contribute half of the overall number of sales force personnel required to market and promote nexavar and half of the medical science liaisons to support nexavar 
we and bayer each bear our own sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these expenses are not included in the calculation of the profits or losses of the collaboration 
revenue from collaboration agreement consists of our share of the pre tax commercial profit generated from our collaboration with bayer  reimbursement of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue 
under the collaboration  bayer recognizes all sales of nexavar worldwide 
we record revenue from collaboration agreement on a quarterly basis 
revenue from collaboration agreement is derived by calculating net sales of nexavar to third party customers and deducting the cost of goods sold  distribution costs  marketing costs including without limitation  advertising and education expenses  selling and promotion expenses  marketing personnel expenses  and bayer marketing services expenses  phase clinical trial costs and allocable overhead costs 
reimbursement by bayer of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue are also included in the revenue from collaboration agreement line item 
our portion of shared collaboration research and development expenses is not included in this line item  but is reflected under operating expenses 
according to the terms of the collaboration agreement  the companies share all research and development  marketing and non us sales expenses 
united states sales force and medical science liaison expenditures incurred by both companies are borne by each company separately and are not included in the calculation 
some of the revenue and expenses recorded to derive the revenue from collaboration agreement during the period presented are estimates of both parties and are subject to further adjustment based on each party s final review should actual results differ from these estimates 
if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods and may be required to restate our results for prior periods 
revenue from collaboration agreement increases with increased nexavar net revenue  or decreases with decreased nexavar net revenue  over and above the associated cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expenses 
increases to the associated costs of goods sold  distribution  selling and general and administrative expenses will decrease revenue from collaboration agreement and decreases to these costs will increase revenue from collaboration agreement 
we expect nexavar sales and bayer s and our shared cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expense to increase with the approval of liver cancer and as bayer continues to expand nexavar marketing and sales activities outside of the united states 
revenue from collaboration agreement was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from collaboration agreement is primarily a result of increased net product revenue on sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in net product revenue was offset by increased costs to sell  distribute and market in countries around the world 
revenue from collaboration agreement is calculated as follows year ended december  in thousands nexavar product revenue  net as recorded by bayer  revenue subject to profit sharing as recorded by bayer  combined cost of goods sold  distribution  selling  general and administrative    combined collaboration commercial profit   onyx s share of collaboration commercial profit  reimbursement of onyx s shared marketing expenses  royalty income  revenue from collaboration agreement   
table of contents license revenue 
license revenue was zero in and and  in license revenue in represents  recognized for selling the rights to certain viruses from our now discontinued therapeutic virus program to shanghai sunway biotech co 
ltd and  recognized for licensing rights to certain cytopathic viruses for therapy and prophylaxis of neoplasia to dnatrix 
we have no ongoing performance obligations under these agreements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  including stock based compensation of million  in  an increase of million  or  from million  including stock based compensation expense of million  in the increase in research and development was primarily due to million of upfront payments related to our development and license agreement with btg and development collaboration  option and license agreement with s bio and costs related to the phase breast trials 
we expect that bayer and we will continue to expand our investment in the development of nexavar by conducting clinical trials to test nexavar s efficacy in more prevalent tumor types in future periods 
additionally  we expect our research and development activities to also include developing onx further 
research and development expenses were million  including stock based compensation expense of million  in  a net decrease of million  or  from million  including stock based compensation expense of million  in the decrease in research and development was due to offsetting factors 
the costs include increased costs for the startup of the phase breast trials 
offsetting this increase for a net decrease in research and development expenses is reduced costs in melanoma spending as patients come off study from this program 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses  approximately in  in and in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
as a result of the cost sharing arrangement between us and bayer  there was a net reimbursable amount of million  million and million to bayer for the years ended december   and  respectively 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and estimates we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
if we underestimate or overestimate the amounts owed to bayer  we may need to adjust these amounts in a future period  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  non refundable upfront payments  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential product candidates 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled phase of development estimated completion is only our estimate of the timing of completion of the current in process development phases based on current information 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of completion of each clinical phase of our development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical product candidates 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  including stock based compensation expense of million  in  a net increase of million  or  from million  including stock based compensation expense of million  in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to us incurring more of the shared marketing expenses in the united states and an increase in headcount in our commercial and administrative functions  including executive and corporate development  needed to support our growth and other salary related expenses  including bonuses

income taxes with the exception of the year ended december   we have incurred significant losses since our inception and  as a result  we have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented prior to december  for the year ended december  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million related to continuing operations 
our tax expense was related primarily to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in and  respectively 
additionally  utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions

in april  azimuth purchased  shares of our common stock for a purchase price of million resulting in approximately million in net cash proceeds received by us

our investment portfolio includes million of aaa rated securities with an auction reset feature auction rate securities collateralized by student loans 
since february  securities of this type have experienced failures in the auction process 
as a result of the auction failures  interest rates on these securities reset at penalty rates linked to libor or treasury bill rates 
the penalty rates are generally higher than interest rates set at auction 
based on the overall failure rate of these auctions  the frequency of the failures  the underlying maturities of the securities  a portion of which are greater than years  and our belief that the market for these student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover  we have classified million of these auction rate securities as non current marketable securities on the accompanying balance sheet 
we have reduced the carrying value of these marketable securities by million through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss instead of earnings  which we believe reflects a temporary decline in fair value of these securities 
further adverse developments in the credit market could result in an impairment charge through earnings in the future 
of the million invested in failed auction rate securities  we estimate the fair value to be million  which is based on a discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flow model used to value these securities is based on a specific term and liquidity assumptions 
an increase in either of these assumptions could result in a million decrease in value 
alternatively  a decrease in either of the assumptions could result in a million increase in value 
currently  we believe the marketable securities classified as non current are not other than temporarily impaired as all of them are substantially backed by the federal government  but it is not clear in what period of time they will be settled 
we believe that  even after reclassifying these securities to non current and the possible requirement to hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and current marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations beyond however  if we change our development plans  including acquiring or developing additional product candidates or complementary businesses  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
we anticipate that our co development costs for the nexavar program may increase over the next several years as we continue to fund our share of the clinical development program and prepare for the potential product launches throughout the world 
in addition  we anticipate that we will incur expenses for the development of onx and  if we exercise one or both of our options  onx and onx  we will be required to pay significant license fees and will incur development expenses 
while these costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the co funding of the program in future periods beyond we intend to seek any required additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases  net of sublease income advance from collaboration partner 
table of contents in  we amended our existing operating lease to occupy  square feet of office space in addition to the  square feet already occupied in emeryville  california  which serves as our corporate headquarters 
the lease expires on march  in  we entered into another operating lease to occupy an additional  square feet of office space in emeryville  california 
this lease expires on november  we also have a lease for  square feet of space in a secondary facility in richmond  california  which we are currently subleasing through september we previously received million in development payments from bayer pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
these development payments contain no provision for interest and are repayable to bayer from a portion of our share of collaboration profits after deducting certain contractually agreed upon expenditures 
as of december   million of these development payments have been repaid to bayer leaving a remaining balance of million  which has been reclassified as a current liability on the accompanying balance sheet 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
by policy  we minimize risk by placing our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  auction rate notes  investment grade government and non government debt securities 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  as of december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december average average fair value interest fair value interest maturity in millions rate maturity in millions rate cash equivalents  fixed rate months months marketable securities  fixed rate months months our investment portfolio includes million of aaa rated securities with an auction reset feature auction rate securities collateralized by student loans

a majority of nexavar sales are generated outside of the united states  and a significant percentage of nexavar commercial and development expenses are incurred outside of the united states 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements  as well as our net sales  cost of goods sold  and operating margins 
the primary foreign currency in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure is the european union euro 
as we expand  we could be exposed to exchange rate fluctuation in other currencies 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
we did not 
table of contents hold any derivative instruments as of december   and we have not held derivative instruments in the past 
however  our investment policy does allow us to use derivative financial instruments for the purposes of hedging foreign currency denominated obligations 
our cash flows are denominated in united states dollars
