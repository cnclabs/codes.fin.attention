item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business redwood trust  inc  together with its subsidiaries  is a financial institution focused on investing in  financing  and managing residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
we seek to invest in assets that have the potential to provide cash flow returns over a long period of time and support our goal of distributing attractive levels of dividends to our stockholders 
for tax purposes  we are structured as a real estate investment trust  or reit 
we are able to pass through substantially all of our earnings generated at our reit to our stockholders without paying income tax at the corporate level 
we pay income tax on the reit taxable income we retain and on the income we earn at our taxable subsidiaries 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which consists of the interest income we earn from our investments in loans and securities less the interest expenses we incur on our borrowed funds and other liabilities 
we assume a range of risks in our investments and the level of risk is influenced by the manner in which we finance our purchase and derive income from our investments 
our primary real estate investments include investments in real estate loans and securities  an investment in a private fund that we sponsor redwood opportunity fund lp the fund and investments in the securitization entities that we sponsor sequoia and acacia 
our direct investments in residential  commercial  and collateralized debt obligations cdo securities are currently financed entirely with equity and long term debt  although we may use short term debt financing to acquire securities and loans from time to time 
until recently  our investment focus has been on credit enhancement securities ces  or below investment grade securities backed by high quality residential and commercial real estate loans 
high quality real estate loans are loans that typically have low loan to value ratios  borrowers with strong credit histories  and other indications of quality relative to the range of loans within us real estate markets as a whole 
these investments tend to have concentrated structural credit risk that is generally reflected in their credit ratings 
more recently  we have been acquiring investment grade securities igs that generally have less concentrated credit risk than ces but have the potential to provide attractive rates of return 
the entities that we sponsor the fund  sequoia  and acacia invest in real estate assets 
assets held at the fund include real estate securities  primarily non prime residential igs and cdo igs  which are funded through the sale of limited partnership interests to us and to third party investors 
the offer and sale of these interests were privately placed and were not registered under the federal securities laws in reliance on an exemption from registration 
assets held at the sequoia entities include residential real estate loans  which are funded through the issuance of asset backed securities abs to us and to third party investors 
assets held at the acacia entities include real estate securities  and some loans and other mortgage related investments  which are funded through the issuance of abs and equity to us and to third party investors 
our investments in each of these entities are currently financed with equity and long term debt 
our capital at risk is limited to these investments as each entity is independent of redwood and of each other and the assets and liabilities are not owned by and are not obligations of redwood 
for financial reporting purposes  we are generally required to consolidate these entities assets  liabilities  and minority interests 
recent developments we ended in the midst of a multifaceted downturn that may be the worst since the great depression 
we were not surprised by the downturn  but we underestimated the extraordinary level and complexity of the financial risks that market participants had taken  the extreme level of leverage employed  and the degree to which the fates of most financial institutions and markets were intertwined 
with the clarity of hindsight  we were too early with some of the investments we made in the first half of  although we believe these investments will ultimately yield acceptable returns 
on the positive side  we financed our investments with permanent capital  which allows us to hold these securities to maturity without the risk of margin calls or forced redemptions 
in addition  starting in mid june we ceased all investing activity so that we could assess the impact of the unprecedented developments occurring in the financial markets and the implications of government intervention in the mortgage market 

table of contents the mortgage credit markets remained under intense pressure through the end of as housing and economic activity continued to deteriorate  available credit and liquidity continued to contract  and the rating agencies issued a barrage of downgrades 
in response  prices for residential and commercial real estate loans and securities saw a steep decline during the year 
so far in  asset prices seem to be holding relatively steady from year end levels 
we caution that this price stability may be temporary  especially as we expect significant additional downgrades of aaa rated residential and commercial mortgage backed securities 
the chart below illustrates the prices that investors were paying to compensate for the perceived credit risk of various types of residential mortgage backed securities rmbs and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs over the last two years 
prices for aaa rmbs and cmbs dropped dramatically in the fourth quarter of after the department of treasury announced it would not use tarp funds to acquire non agency mortgage securities 
in early  prices have partially recovered from their lows

source credit suisse  jpmorgan chase  redwood trust various arms of the federal government have announced a variety of programs and legislation  and congress has adopted stimulus packages aimed at stemming the decline in home values  slowing the rate of foreclosures  and getting the economy and banking system back on track 
overall  these and other initiatives should be positive for redwood 
we support government policy aimed at helping homeowners 
actions that improve conditions in the housing market will directly benefit redwood if they lead to lower losses and faster prepayments 
we believe  however  that there is unlikely to be a near term recovery in housing or the economy 
in spite of difficult times ahead  and after spending four months watching and analyzing from the sidelines  we have been active investors in residential igs since the latter part of we believe we can now make attractive long term residential mortgage related investments with a comfortable margin of safety 
we invested million in aaa rated residential igs in the fourth quarter of at a weighted average price of of face value and with average credit support of percentage points 
in addition  we invested million in residential ces at a weighted average price of of face value 
we have continued to acquire assets in the first quarter of and through february   we invested million in residential igs at a weighted average price of of face value and with average credit support of percentage points 
the vast majority of these rmbs investments are in senior securities backed by prime or near prime loans 
it had become clear from our market analysis that the size of the current investment opportunity was substantially larger than the excess capital we had on hand to invest at the end of after much research and analysis  we concluded that raising funds through the sale of common stock would be accretive to earnings after the proceeds were deployed into new investments and would  therefore  be in the best interest of redwood and its shareholders 
we commenced a common stock offering in january and were 
table of contents successful in raising million of new equity capital for the company 
this was an offensive and discretionary capital raise  as our existing investments continue to generate more than sufficient cash flow to cover our operating costs 
we expect to generate over million in positive cash flow in from our existing investments  and had million of unrestricted cash and no short term debt at december  additional investments made with the capital raised will significantly extend the duration of our investment cash flows and allow us to leverage our existing overhead without adding personnel  systems or space 
outlook looking ahead to and  we see no easy fixes to the many economic challenges we face 
we expect governments and the private sector to continue probing for solutions that will enable homeowners and the markets to stabilize 
complicating the problem is the extreme level of anger from all quarters in some cases  justifiably so at banks  regulators  wall street and washington  among others 
we are not yet at the point at which emotions can subside and people can resume working with and trusting each other again 
we believe it is simply going to take time  and that eventually  market forces will take hold and provide the needed stability for the economy to recover 
of course  of particular interest to redwood  is the health of the housing sector 
it is clearly in redwood s interest for home values to stabilize as soon as possible 
unfortunately  despite all the good intentions of government programs  we believe that home values will continue to fall for some time until housing inventories decline and values come back in line with income and rental fundamentals 
the rapid increase in home values between january and december a period during which home prices doubled was driven not by fundamentals but by excessive leverage and creative affordability mortgage products that stretched the purchasing power of borrowers 
home ownership rates  which had averaged in the years prior to  rose to between and we believe we are now in the midst of a painful retrenchment period during which home values and home ownership rates will decline until they are in line with historical norms 
realistically  this is likely to take years 
as the government becomes further enmeshed in the banking system  and as support builds for a bankruptcy law cramdown amendment that will enable bankruptcy courts to modify mortgage loan terms  we believe the industry will continue to see mounting pressure to accept loan modifications or be forced to accept them through a cramdown in bankruptcy 
we believe those loan modifications will have a relatively small financial impact on our existing portfolio 
we expect that the biggest impact of modifications will be on lower rated non prime securities 
our capital investment in these types of securities is minimal per share at december  
for new investments  our analysis takes into account the likely negative impact to investors from projected loan modifications 
like loan modifications  we do not think that bankruptcy cramdowns will have a major impact on redwood 
we believe cramdowns will have more of an impact on non prime securities  for which we have an increasingly smaller exposure 
we note that as of december  only of prime borrowers were in bankruptcy proceedings compared to for subprime borrowers according to data from loanperformance 
furthermore  the proposed cramdown amendment may result in additional downgrades of aaa securities and additional forced selling by investors whose capital allocation is ratings sensitive 
this could present attractive investment opportunities for redwood  as many current aaa investors are ratings sensitive and could be pressured to sell ie they can only own securities that are rated aaa 
other investors  such as banks  would face significantly higher capital requirements to hold lower rated securities 
we continue to offer support for government programs designed to alleviate the housing and credit crisis  but we believe that as a nation  we must determine what long term role the government should play in the mortgage market 
we are of the opinion that governmental entities can t do it all  and that private sector financing through securitization will be essential to getting the mortgage markets back on track 
we will continue to support the creative exploration of securitization solutions and we look forward to resuming our role of facilitating credit risk transfers 
in the meantime  we will continue to invest carefully and patiently in assets that we believe will generate attractive returns with comfortable margins of safety 
our investment philosophy has not changed we intend to continue acquiring assets that we believe will generate attractive long term cash flows 
our primary focus will be on investments similar to our recent purchases senior cash flows from prime and near prime rmbs 
to a lesser degree  we may selectively purchase credit sensitive securities with a shorter duration  but with the expectation of high projected rates of 
table of contents return 
as we intend to fund these investments with permanent capital  we can sustain a period of price volatility without the risk of margin calls or equity redemptions 
if market discount rates go higher and asset prices go lower  it affects our opportunity cost  but does not change our long term investment returns 
we have no current plans to purchase commercial mortgage backed securities  although we constantly monitor the commercial market and the steps the government is taking in this area 
we believe that difficult times lay ahead in the commercial real estate sector  as escalating economic woes continue to place downward pressure on property level cash flows and valuations 
commercial lending activity has been dramatically curtailed  with no new securitizations issued since the first half of rising delinquencies have recently prompted multiple ratings downgrades for some existing cmbs up to and including junior aaa securities 
while the government appears committed to eventually facilitate liquidity to the commercial sector  it is our expectation that in the near term  the government s aim will remain more consumer focused 
we expect that gaap earnings will remain volatile in the near term due to mark to market mtm adjustments 
we may recognize additional gaap impairment losses on residential  commercial  and cdo securities held at redwood 
negative mtm balance sheet write downs that have not yet been realized through our income statement totaled million at december  future income statement impairment charges related to these unrealized losses will not affect gaap book value since these mtm losses were already deducted from stockholders equity at december  the fair value accounting principles we follow for the assets and liabilities at acacia may also contribute to future mtm volatility 
actual reit taxable income in will depend on the timing of credit losses and the level of taxable income generated by our new and existing investments 
we currently expect that taxable income will continue to be pressured by the realization of credit losses in and it is highly probable that taxable income for will be negative 
in november  our board of directors announced its intention to distribute a regular dividend of per share per quarter during summary of results of operations and financial condition our reported gaap net loss was million per share for as compared to a gaap net loss of billion per share for our gaap book value per common share was at december   an increase from negative at december  and a decrease from at january  our estimated book value after giving effect to our adoption of fas

net interest income at redwood declined by million due to higher credit losses  slower prepayments  and lower interest rates on securities  and due to our decision to hold larger amounts of low yielding cash balances throughout net interest income at sequoia declined by million due to lower interest rates on adjustable rate loans  partially offset by lower premium expenses 
net interest income at acacia declined by million due to the absence of discount income on securities in  stemming from accounting changes resulting from our adoption of fas these declines were partially offset by million of net interest income generated on securities at the fund during operating expenses increased by million in as compared to primarily due to an increase in non recurring legal and consulting expenses 
there was an million positive change in our tax provision in as compared to in august  our board of directors decided to distribute of our reit taxable income generated in and as dividends to shareholders

december  in millions earlier total of total securites residential igs prime non prime total igs ces prime non prime total ces total residential commercial ces cdo total securities at redwood our investment strategy for real estate securities has shifted over the past year to acquiring residential prime and near prime senior cash flows with a comfortable margin of safety to protect against escalating credit losses 
as a result  the fair value of our residential igs at december   was million  representing of our total portfolio  an increase from at december  this percentage change in the components of our total portfolio was also the result of declines in the value of our ces  as discussed below 
our returns on these igs investments will be based on how much principal and interest we ultimately receive and how quickly we receive it 
we fully expect  and base our analysis on  more bad things happening in housing 
in our base case  we expect  on average  another decline in nationwide home values and as much as a decline in some major markets 
in this market  our target investment profile has been attractive mid to high teen returns in the unlevered base case  well protected stress case returns  and exceptional upside returns if we benefit from faster prepayments or lower credit losses 
we model these profiles based upon our forecasts of the underlying collateral cash flows and the level of subordination protecting against future credit losses 
we do not rely on credit ratings as part of our investment decision process 
we emphasize this point because in we expect significant rating agency downgrades of prime and non prime aaa rated residential igs issued from through the overall credit performance of loans underlying these vintages is significantly worse than the rating agency original expectations 
in many cases  we expect securities currently rated aaa to be downgraded below investment grade  and in some cases downgraded to ccc 
as our igs investments primarily represent senior cash flows  we do not expect a high level of losses 
our igs returns are generally more sensitive to changes in prepayment rates than they are to credit 
as has been well publicized  many borrowers are currently having difficulty refinancing due to high non agency mortgage rates  insufficient home equity  and stringent underwriting 
a pick up in refinance activity either from lower non agency mortgage rates or from the government s initiatives to stimulate refinancing would benefit our igs returns 
the fair value of our residential ces portfolio was million representing of our total portfolio at december   down from a year ago 
this decline resulted from a reduction in market values due to negative mark to market adjustments and from our decision to re direct our investment focus to senior cash flows or igs 
we acquire ces at a significant discount to principal value as credit losses could reduce or eliminate the principal value of these bonds 
in an ideal environment  we would experience fast prepayments 
table of contents and low credit losses allowing us to recover a substantial part of the discount as income 
conversely  a less beneficial environment is the environment we are currently experiencing with slow prepayments and high credit losses 
our residential ces from and prior total million and are carried on average at of their face values 
from a credit standpoint  those vintages are generally performing in line with or better than our initial expectations 
our ces investments from to vintages total million  representing of face value 
based on the poor credit trends underlying these vintages  we expect that future credit losses will eliminate virtually all of the principal or face amount of these securities 
therefore  the value ascribed to these securities is derived from the present value of future interest we expect to collect before actual credit losses are realized 
our commercial ces represents of our securities portfolio  down from a year ago 
we have not purchased commercial securities since the first quarter of due to continuing deterioration in the fundamentals increasing vacancies  falling rents in an increasingly weakening economy slowdown in consumer spending  increase in layoffs and unemployment  we wrote down our commercial ces to million  or of face value in the fourth quarter 
the gaap value which equals fair value of our investments in the fund was million at december  these investments represent a interest in the fund  which closed in march and is fully invested 
the fund is managed by a subsidiary of redwood 
all of the fund s cash flow excluding expenses and management fees is distributed to the limited partners quarterly 
the gaap value and fair value of our investments in sequoia was million and million  respectively  at december  these investments consist primarily of interest only securities ios and to a lesser extent igs and ces 
our returns on these investments are most sensitive to prepayments although material changes in interest rates also have a short term impact on cash flows generated 
the gaap value and fair value of our investments in acacia  was million and million  respectively  at december  these investments represent equity interests and abs issued from our acacia cdo securitization entities and the management fees we receive from those entities 
due to various provisions in each cdo securitization  our equity interests are generally cut off from cash flows and we only expect limited returns on the abs issued we own 
we value the management fees at million  which equals our projected fees discounted at a rate

this is the reason pro forma economic book value declined from per share pre offering to per share post offering 
capital and liquidity throughout  we maintained our strong balance sheet and liquidity

as adjusted to reflect the receipt of the million common stock offering in january  we had million in cash and cash equivalents  or per share 
all of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in us treasury bills or fdic insured bank deposits 
we ended with total capital of million  which consists of million of common equity and million of year long term debt due in we had no short term debt at december   and do not anticipate adding any in the current environment since our anticipated acquisitions are generally illiquid and subject to volatile market value changes 
we fund these investments with permanent capital equity and long term debt that will enable us to hold the securities to maturity without the risk of margin calls or forced redemptions 
our quarterly sources and uses of our cash is one of the financial metrics on which we focus 
therefore  as a supplement to the consolidated statement of cash flows included in this annual report on form k  we show in the table below i the beginning cash balance at september   and the ending cash balance at december   which are gaap amounts  and ii the components of sources and uses of cash organized in a manner consistent with the way management analyzes them

months ended december  vintage in millions earlier total redwood the fund sequoia acacia total cash flow by vintage at this time  we believe our quarterly cash flows in generated from our existing investments excluding our cash at december   will be similar to the cash flows in the fourth quarter of we caution that these are projections and the actual results may vary and will depend upon the amount and timing of credit losses  the amount and timing of prepayments  and the nature and impact of legislative and regulatory actions  among other factors 
overall  we expect cash flow from existing investments to trend lower over time 
future increases in cash flow could be generated by successfully reinvesting the cash flow from our existing investments  successfully investing our cash of million at december   and successfully investing the million in proceeds from our january common stock offering 
the amount of cash flow from investments could be volatile from quarter to quarter depending on prepayment patterns  changes in interest rates  and the level of credit losses 
factors affecting management s estimate of economic value in reviewing the non gaap supplemental components of book value which are included herein  which we also refer to as management s estimate of economic value  there are a number of important factors and limitations to consider 
the estimated fair value of our stockholders equity is calculated as of a particular point in time based on our existing assets and liabilities and does not incorporate other factors that may have a significant impact on that value  most notably the impact of future business activities and cash flows to be received 
as a result  the estimated economic value of our stockholders equity does not necessarily represent an estimate of our net realizable value  liquidation value or our market value as a whole 
amounts we ultimately realize from the disposition of assets or settlement of liabilities may vary significantly from the 
table of contents estimated economic values presented in our non gaap supplemental components of book value 
because temporary changes in market conditions can substantially affect the economic value of our stockholders equity  we do not believe that short term fluctuations in the economic value of our assets and liabilities are necessarily representative of the effectiveness of our investment strategy or the long term underlying value of our business 
when quoted market prices or observable market data are not available to estimate fair value  we rely on level inputs 
because assets and liabilities classified as level are generally based on unobservable inputs  the process of calculating economic value is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of economic value  and the use of different assumptions as well as changes in market conditions could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations vs beginning in  we began discussing our operations in a manner that more clearly illustrates how our investments in consolidated entities impact our overall financial results 
the following discussion is based upon management s condensed consolidating results for redwood  the fund  sequoia  and acacia and acts as a supplement to our gaap results for and comparative results for and continue to be presented on a consolidated basis

table of contents we reduced the cost basis of many of our afs securities through impairment charges during and and increased the amount of current principal face designated as credit reserves 
the more credit reserves we designate on securities reduces the amount of discount that we amortize into income over time 
the adequacy of these credit reserves is based upon the long term performance of these securities and is subject to change over time 
the most significant economic factor affecting the performance of igs is the rate of principal repayments 
as these investments primarily represent senior cash flows  we do not expect a high level of losses 
our igs returns are therefore more sensitive to changes in prepayment rates than they are to credit 
a pick up in refinance activity due to lower mortgage rates or other factors would benefit our igs returns 
average prepayment speeds on prime residential igs declined to cpr in  as compared to cpr in the most significant economic factors affecting the performance of ces are the timing and amount of credit losses and the rate of principal repayments 
in general  lower credit losses and higher prepayment speeds benefit ces that we buy at a significant discount to face value 
over the past year  delinquencies have been rising and prepayments have been slowing 
serious delinquencies on prime residential ces loans that are days delinquent were of current balances as of december   as compared to of current balances as of december  serious delinquencies on commercial ces loans that are days delinquent were of current balances as of december   as compared to of current balances as of december  average prepayment speeds on prime residential ces declined to cpr in  as compared to cpr in there are generally no prepayments on commercial ces

the allowance for loan losses increased to million or of the residential loan balance at december   from million or at december  serious delinquencies days delinquent increased to million or of residential loan balances at december   from million or at december  although we report our provision  allowance  and delinquency information on a consolidated basis  the credit performance of each sequoia securitization is separate and independent and may vary significantly from the credit performance of other sequoia securitizations 
we may be required for gaap reporting purposes to record an allowance for loan losses on certain pools of loans that in aggregate exceeds our equity investment at risk in those pools 
as of december   we had recorded loan loss provision expenses that exceeded the outstanding principal face amount of our investments in two consolidated sequoia securitizations 
to the extent actual and expected losses on the collateral pools increase  the disparity between the reported gaap book value of our investments and their economic value could grow during during the fourth quarter of  we completed a sale of our variable interests in three sequoia securitizations backed by hybrid loans originated during the credit performance of these loans had deteriorated over the past year and we had recorded a loan loss provision expense in excess of our investment as of september  upon the sale of our variable interests  which included the junior economic interests or ces and associated call rights of each securitization  we determined after completing a fas and fin r accounting analysis that we should derecognize the associated assets and liabilities of these securitizations for financial reporting purposes 
we derecognized billion of real estate loans and other assets and billion of abs issued and other liabilities  for a net realized gain of million 
as a result of these transactions  we were required to recognize certain abs issued by sequoia and owned by acacia entities 
these abs issued had been previously eliminated upon consolidation for financial reporting purposes 
we recognized a million negative market valuation adjustment related to these sequoia abs issued in accordance with our election to adopt fas for all assets at acacia 
we also recognized less than million of other offsetting positive adjustments 
the net effect of all transactions associated with this deconsolidation was a million increase in realized gains on sales and calls  net  which was recorded to our consolidated statement of loss income as of december  net interest income at sequoia was million in as compared to million in  a decline of million 
the primary reasons for this decline were lower benchmark libor rates on adjustable rate

change in interest income years ended december  vs 
december in thousands volume rate total change real estate loans    cash and cash equivalents total interest income    interest income declined because of lower volume due to repayments on existing loans with no offsetting loan acquisitions and short term interest rates have generally been lower during than  as most of our loans are indexed to short term rates 
a significant offset to interest income is the loan premium amortization that we expense each period to reduce the net unamortized purchase premium for loans at sequoia 
loan premium amortization was million for as compared to million for  a decline of million 
as a percent of gross interest income  loan premium amortization was for both and  although the amount and timing of periodic amortization has historically been volatile due to the gaap accounting elections we apply 
for the last several years  loan premium amortization has not kept pace with loan prepayments due to the amortization method we apply for a portion of loans at sequoia 
this method more closely links amortization to short term interest rates and resulted in lower premium expenses during prior periods when libor increased 
conversely  since libor declined during the fourth quarter of  we expect our premium amortization expenses to increase in future periods

results of operations acacia acacia is our brand name for the cdo securitization entities that we sponsor 
the assets held by acacia entities primarily consist of igs and some ces

acacia also owns other real estate assets such as real estate cdo securities  corporate debt issued by equity reits  real estate loans  and synthetic real estate assets

prior to  we were required under gaap to record most of the assets at acacia at their estimated fair values and their paired liabilities at their amortized cost 
this created an accounting discrepancy that resulted in a significant disparity between the gaap book value and the economic value of our investments in acacia

we detail these adjustments in a separate mark to market adjustments section

this includes market valuation adjustments on derivatives used to hedge the interest rate exposure of acacia liabilities 
certain valuation changes on derivatives previously accounted for as cash flow hedges were recorded as a component of interest expense during we received million of cash distributions from our acacia equity investments during  million of which related to a resolved claim from our call of acacia in during  nine of the ten of our acacia equity investments stopped receiving cash distributions due to performance deficiencies consisting primarily of rating agency downgrades on securities held at acacia entities  which significantly affected the yield we expect to earn on these investments

table of contents total consolidated interest expense decreased to million in from million in the primary reason relates to a decline in the average balance outstanding of abs issued offset to some extent by higher average balances of redwood debt and subordinated notes 
interest expense on consolidated abs decreased by million  to million in  from million in the reduction in consolidated abs interest expense was caused by a decline in the average balance of outstanding consolidated abs issued as a result of prepayments of the loans within these securitization entities 
offsetting some of the decline in balances was the higher cost of funds due to an increase in short term interest rates during the first nine months of as most of our debt and consolidated abs issued is indexed to one  three  or six months libor 
these factors are illustrated in the volume and rate change table below 
interest expenses on redwood debt increased by million to million in from million in as a result of increased use of redwood debt primarily during the first half of the average balance of our outstanding redwood debt increased during due to a high level of financing for the acquisition of residential real estate loans and securities prior to the securitization of these assets through sequoia and acacia  including from calling some older sequoia loan securitizations and financing of aaa and aa rated real estate securities during the early part of the year

there was severance expense as part of a realignment of residential and commercial operations in and no such expense in fixed compensation expense includes employee salaries and related employee benefits 
our average headcount increased in over levels and combined with salary increases in accounts for the year over year increase in the fixed compensation 
variable compensation expense was lower in due to lower employee bonus expenses 
non compensation expenses were relatively the same in as in the ongoing office and system related costs were in line with our staffing growth 
these increases were offset by a decrease in due diligence expenses as our acquisition activity was lower in realized gains on sales and calls total realized gains on sales and calls were lower for compared to the primary reason was the fact that prices on securities fell throughout and  as a result  we did not choose to exercise our call rights on eligible acacia entities 
in  we called three acacias  sold the underlying assets and recognized gains after paying back the related debt 
early in  we called one acacia and generated some gains 
as prices on securities fell in the second half of  the liquidity in the market also became restricted 
early in the second half of  we decided to sell most of our aaa rated securities funded with debt and did so at a loss  further contributing to the disparity in net losses gains on sales between and in the second half of  we acquired certain acacia abs at discounts relative to the issued price 
these transactions generated a million gain  which was the difference between our purchase price million and the outstanding amortized principal balance of the abs acquired million

this volatility can occur for a variety of reasons  including the timing and amount of purchases  sales  calls  and repayment of consolidated assets  changes in the fair values of consolidated assets and liabilities  and certain non recurring events 
in addition  volatility may occur because of technical accounting issues  some of which are described below 
changes in premium amortization for loans at sequoia the unamortized premium for loans owned by sequoia was million at december  the amount of periodic premium amortization expense we recognize is volatile and dependent on a number of factors  including credit performance of the underlying loans  changes in prepayment speeds  and changes in short term interest rates 
loan premium amortization was million in  million in  and million in  illustrating the volatility of this expense 

table of contents changes in discount amortization for securities at redwood and the fund the unamortized discount  net of designated credit reserves  for securities owned at redwood and the fund was million at december  the amount of periodic discount amortization income we recognize is volatile and dependent on a number of factors  including credit performance of the underlying loans  changes in prepayment speeds  and changes in short term interest rates 
discount amortization on securities was million in  million in  and million in  illustrating the volatility of this expense 
changes in fair values of securities all of the securities owned at redwood and consolidated entities are classified as either trading or available for sale afs securities  and in both cases are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values 
for trading securities  changes in fair values are recorded in the consolidated statements of loss income 
periodic fluctuations in the values of these investments are inherently volatile and thus can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
for afs securities  cumulative unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity deficit 
unrealized gains and losses are not charged against current earnings to the extent they are temporary in nature 
certain factors may require us however  to recognize these amounts as other than temporary impairments and record them through our current earnings 
factors that determine other than temporary impairment include a change in our ability or intent to hold assets  adverse changes to projected cash flows of assets  or the likelihood that declines in the fair values of assets would not return to their previous levels within a reasonable time 
impairments on securities are generally non recurring and can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
as of january   we elected to adopt a new accounting standard  fas  to record the assets and liabilities in acacia and certain other assets at redwood at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of market valuation adjustments  net  in our consolidated statements of loss income 
we may also elect the fair value option for certain new acquisitions in the future 
our fas elections significantly improved the disparity that existed between the gaap carrying value of our acacia equity investments and our estimate of their economic value 
however  valuation changes in these financial instruments are inherently volatile and can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments we can experience significant earnings volatility from our use of derivatives 
we generally use derivatives to hedge cash flows on assets and liabilities that have different coupon rates fixed rates versus floating rates  or floating rates based on different indices 
the nature of the instruments we use and the accounting treatment for the specific assets  liabilities  and derivatives may lead to volatile periodic earnings  even when we are meeting our hedging objectives 
all derivatives are accounted for as trading instruments and their changes in market values flow through our consolidated statements of loss income 
the assets and liabilities we hedge may not be similarly accounted for as our hedging derivatives eg  they may be reported at cost  or only impairments may be reported through our consolidated statements of loss income 
this could lead to reported income and book values in specific periods that do not necessarily reflect the economics of our hedging strategy 
even when the assets and liabilities are similarly accounted for as trading instruments  periodic changes in their value may not coincide as other market factors eg  supply and demand may affect certain instruments and not others at any given time 
changes in future accounting principles changes in future accounting principles can have a significant impact on the amount or timing of our reported gaap earnings 

table of contents potential taxable income volatility we expect quarter to quarter estimated taxable income volatility for a variety of reasons  including the timing of credit losses and prepayments on our consolidated investments  and equity award taxation  as described below 
credit losses on securities and loans at redwood to determine estimated taxable income we are not permitted to anticipate  or reserve for  credit losses on investments that we purchase at a discount 
for tax purposes  we accrete the entire purchase discount on a security into taxable income over the expected life of the security 
estimated taxable income is only reduced when actual credit losses occur 
for gaap purposes  we establish a credit reserve and only amortize a portion of the purchase discount  if any  into income 
we are also required to write down securities that become impaired for gaap 
our income recognition is therefore faster for tax as compared to gaap  especially in the early years of owning a security purchased at a discount when there are generally few credit losses 
at december   the cumulative difference between the gaap and tax amortized costs basis of our residential  commercial  and cdo ces excluding our investments in sequoia and acacia was million 
in addition  as of december   we had an allowance for loan losses gaap of million for our consolidated residential and commercial loans 
as we have no credit reserves or allowances for tax  any future credit losses on securities or loans would have a more significant impact on tax earnings than on gaap earnings and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses fluctuates during reporting periods 
income recognition on interest only securities ios at sequoia as part of our investment in sequoia securitization entities  we often retain interest only ios securities at the time they are issued 
our current tax basis in these securities is million 
the return on io securities is sensitive to prepayments 
typically  fast prepayments reduce yields and slow prepayments increase yields 
we are not permitted to recognize a negative yield under tax accounting rules so  during periods of fast prepayments  our periodic premium expense can be relatively low and the cost basis for these securities may not be significantly reduced 
in periods prior to  we did experience fast prepayments on these loans 
during  the prepayments have been slowing  although we are still not amortizing the loans as quickly as we might otherwise do so under gaap 
should prepayments remain slow  we would expect the resulting tax basis to more closely reflect the actual market values of these ios over time 
many of our sequoia securitizations are callable or will become callable over the next two years  although we do not currently anticipate calling any sequoia securitizations in or if we do call a sequoia  the remaining tax basis in the ios is written off creating an ordinary loss at the call date 
compensation expense at redwood the total tax expense for equity award compensation is dependent upon varying factors such as the timing of payments of dividend equivalent rights  the exercise of stock options  the distribution of deferred stock units  and the deferrals to and withdrawals from our executive deferred compensation plan 
for gaap  the total expense associated with an equity award is determined at the award date and is generally recognized over the vesting period 
for tax  the total expense is recognized at the date of distribution or exercise and not the award date 
the amount of compensation expense could therefore be significantly different for tax than for gaap in addition to the differences in timing

many of these loans are jumbo loans  with loan balances greater than existing conforming loan limits 
prime securities typically have relatively high weighted average fico scores or higher  low weighted average loan to value ratios ltv or less  and limited concentrations of investor properties 
non prime securities are residential mortgage backed securities that are not backed by high credit quality loans 
most of the borrowers backing non prime loans have lower fico scores or impaired credit histories  but exhibit the ability to repay the loan 
to compensate for the greater risks and higher costs to service non prime loans  borrowers often pay higher interest rates  and possibly higher origination fees 
we use loss assumptions that are significantly higher when acquiring securities backed by non prime loans than we use when acquiring securities backed by prime loans

all consolidated abs issued are collateralized by real estate loans and securities 
although the stated maturity is as shown  the abs obligations will pay down as the principal of these real estate loans or securities pay down 
the amount shown is the face value of the abs issued and not necessarily the value reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated interest payments on consolidated abs issued is calculated based on the contractual maturity of the abs and therefore assumes no prepayments of the principal outstanding as of december

table of contents market risks we seek to manage the risks inherent in our business including but not limited to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  and fair value risk in a prudent manner designed to enhance our earnings and dividends and preserve our capital 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with these risks 
credit risk integral to our core business is assuming the credit risk of real estate loans primarily through the ownership of residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
some of our capital base is employed in owning credit enhancement securities that have below investment grade credit ratings due to their concentrated credit risks with respect to underlying real estate loans and investment grade securities 
we believe that many of the loans underlying these securities are above average in credit quality as compared to us real estate loans in general  but the balance and percentage of loans with special risk factors higher risk commercial loans  interest only and negative amortization residential loan types  and alt a and subprime residential loans has increased and continues to increase 
we may also own residential real estate loans that are not securitized 
credit losses from the loans in securitized loan pools  in general  first reduce the principal value of and economic returns on the lower rated securities in these pools 
credit losses on real estate loans can occur for many reasons  including poor origination practices  fraud  faulty appraisals  documentation errors  poor underwriting  legal errors  poor servicing practices  weak economic conditions  decline in the value of homes  businesses  or commercial properties  special hazards  earthquakes and other natural events  over leveraging of the borrower or on the property  reduction in market rents and occupancies and poor property management practices  changes in legal protections for lenders  reduction in personal incomes  job loss  and personal events such as divorce or health problems 
in addition  if the us economy or the housing market weakens further than we have anticipated  our credit losses could increase beyond levels that we have anticipated 
credit losses on real estate loans can vary for reasons not related to the general economy 
with respect to most of the loans securitized by securitization entities sponsored by us and for a portion of the loans underlying residential loan securities we have acquired from securitizations sponsored by others  the interest rate is adjustable 
accordingly  when short term interest rates rise  required monthly payments from homeowners may rise under the terms of these loans  and this may increase borrowers delinquencies and defaults 
we also acquire securities backed by negative amortization adjustable rate loans made to residential borrowers  some of which are prime quality loans while many are alt a quality loans and a few are subprime loans 
we invest in these riskier loan types with the expectation of significantly higher delinquencies and losses as compared to regular amortization loans  but believe these securities offer us the opportunity to generate attractive risk adjusted returns as a result of attractive pricing and the manner in which these securitizations are structured 
nevertheless  there remains substantial uncertainty about the future performance of these assets 
the large majority of the commercial loans we credit enhance are fixed rate loans  some of which are interest only loans 
in general  these loans are not fully amortizing and therefore require balloon payments at maturity 
consequently  we could be exposed to credit losses at the maturity of these loans if the borrower is unable to repay or refinance the borrowing with another third party lender 
we will experience credit losses on residential and commercial loans and securities  and to the extent the losses are consistent with the amount and timing of our assumptions  we expect to earn attractive returns on our investments 
we manage our credit risks by understanding the extent of the risk we are taking and insuring the appropriate underwriting criteria are met  and we utilize systems and staff to continually monitor the ongoing credit performance of each loan and security 
to the extent we find the credit risks on specific assets are changing adversely  we will take actions including selling the assets to mitigate potential losses 
however  we may not always be successful in foreseeing adverse changes in credit performance or in effectively mitigating future credit losses 

table of contents in addition to residential and commercial ces  redwood  the fund  and acacia own investment grade and other securities issued by securitization entities that are sponsored by others 
these securities are rated aaa through bbb  and are typically in a third loss or better position or are otherwise effectively more senior in the credit structure in comparison to first loss ces or their equivalent 
a risk we face with respect to these securities is that we do not generally control or influence the underwriting  servicing  management  or loss mitigation with respect to these underlying loans 
the acacia entities  the fund  and redwood also own securities backed by subprime and alt a residential loans that have substantially higher credit risk characteristics than prime quality loans 
consequently  we can expect these lower quality loans to have higher rates of delinquency and loss  and if such losses differ from our assumptions  acacia  the fund  and redwood could suffer losses 
the acacia entities also own certain igs and ces loan securities purchased from the sequoia securitization entities we sponsor 
these securities are generally less likely to suffer credit losses than other securities since credit losses ordinarily would not occur until cumulative credit losses within the pool of securitized loans exceed the principal value of the subordinated ces underneath and other credit protections have been exhausted 
however  if the pools of residential and commercial loans underlying these securities were to experience poor credit results  these securities could have their credit ratings downgraded  could suffer decreases in fair value  or could experience principal losses 
if any of these events occurs  it would likely reduce our returns from these investments 
interest rate risk interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can affect the cash flows and fair values of our assets  liabilities  and interest rate agreements  and consequently  affect our earnings and reported equity 
our general strategy with respect to interest rates is to maintain an asset liability posture including hedges on a consolidated basis that assumes some interest rate risks but not to such a degree that the achievement of our long term goals would likely be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we are willing to accept short term volatility of earnings and changes in our reported equity in order to accomplish our goal of achieving attractive long term returns 
to implement our interest rate risk strategy  we may use interest rate agreements in an effort to maintain a close match between pledged assets and debt  as well as between the interest rate characteristics of the assets in the securitization entities and the corresponding abs issued 
however  we generally do not attempt to completely hedge changes in interest rates  and at times  we may be subject to more interest rate risk than we generally desire in the long term 
changes in interest rates will have an impact on the values and cash flows of our assets and corresponding liabilities 
prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that benefits from investments in prepayment sensitive assets while limiting the risk of adverse prepayment fluctuations to an amount that  in most circumstances  can be absorbed by our capital base while still allowing us to make regular dividend payments 
prepayments affect gaap earnings in the near term primarily through the timing of the amortization of purchase premium and discount and through triggering market valuation adjustments 
for example  amortization income from discount assets may not necessarily offset amortization expense from premium assets  and vice versa 
in addition  variations in current and projected prepayment rates for individual assets and changes in interest rates as they affect projected coupons on arms and other assets and thus change effective yield calculations may cause net premium amortization expense or net discount amortization income to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
moreover  the timing of premium amortization on assets may not always match the timing of the premium amortization on liabilities even when the underlying assets and liabilities are in the same securitization and pay down at the same rate 
prepayment risks exist in the assets and associated liabilities consolidated on our balance sheets 
in general  discount securities benefit from faster prepayment rates on the underlying real estate loans while premium securities such as ios benefit from slower prepayments on the underlying loans 
we are currently 
table of contents biased in favor of faster prepayment speeds with respect to the long term economic effect of residential loan prepayments 
however  in the short term  increases in residential loan prepayment rates could result in gaap earnings volatility 
with respect to securities backed by residential mortgage loans and in particular  ios  changes in prepayment forecasts by market participants could affect the market prices of those securities sold by securitization entities  and thus could affect the profits we earn from securitizing assets 
our credit results and risks can also be affected by prepayments 
for example  credit risks for the securities we own are reduced each time a loan prepays 
all other factors being equal  faster prepayment rates should reduce our credit risks on our existing portfolio 
we caution that prepayment rates are difficult to predict or anticipate  and variations in prepayment rates can materially affect our earnings and dividends 
arm prepayment rates  for example  are driven by many factors  one of which is the steepness of the yield curve 
as the yield curve flattens short term interest rates rise relative to longer term interest rates  arm prepayments typically increase 
fair value and liquidity risks the securities that we sponsor are generally funded with equity with no associated recourse debt that might affect our liquidity position 
on january  we elected the fair value option under fas for assets and liabilities at acacia  with all changes in market values now being recorded through our income statement 
though this adds to our potential earnings volatility  the securities and abs issued by acacia entities have no recourse to us that would otherwise affect our liquidity position 
changes in the fair values or ratings downgrades of assets owned by an acacia entity may also create differences between our reported gaap and taxable income 
however  we do not currently believe this will create liquidity issues for us 
most of the real estate loans that we consolidate are accounted for as held for investment and reported at amortized cost 
most of these loans have been sold to sequoia entities and  thus  changes in the fair value of the loans do not have an impact on our liquidity 
however  changes in fair values during the accumulation period while these loans are funded with short term redwood debt before they are sold to a sequoia entity may have a short term effect on our liquidity 
we may also own some real estate loans accounted for as held for sale and adverse changes in their value would be recognized through our income statement and may have an impact on our ability to obtain financing for them 
our consolidated obligations consist primarily of abs issued 
changes in fair value of abs issued generally have no impact on our liquidity 
abs issued by sequoia are reported at amortized cost as our the residential loans collateralizing these abs 
beginning january   we report at fair value the abs issued by acacia and also report the underlying securities collateralizing the abs issued at fair value 
in either case  the resulting net equity assets less liabilities may not necessarily be reflective of the fair value of our interests in these securitization entities 
however  since the abs issued can only look to the cash flows generated by the assets within that securitization for payments of interest and repayments of the face value of the abs  the changes in fair value do not have an effect on redwood 
only to the extent that changes in fair values affect the timing of the cash flows we might receive on our investments in the acacia entities  is there an effect to redwood from changes in fair values of these securities 
there are no such considerations in the sequoia securitization entities 
we may fund some assets with a combination of short term debt and equity generally prior to securitization that is recourse to redwood 
this generally increases our fair value and liquidity risks 
we manage these risks by maintaining what we believe to be conservative capital levels under our internal risk adjusted capital and risk management policies and by ensuring we have a variety of financing facilities available to fund each of our assets 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 

table of contents our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
our activities and balance sheets are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation 
effect of governmental initiatives on market risks recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging  with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through the end of continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation or deflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  and the declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy 
these market and economic conditions have spurred governmental initiatives and interventions designed to address them  however  the effect these governmental actions will have is not yet fully known 
for example  in february the president announced a homeowner affordability and stability plan  which is primarily focused on reducing foreclosures through loan modifications  and increasing refinancing opportunities for homeowners with mortgages that conform to governmental agency criteria 
details of the plan will be released in march  but it appears that the administration will be taking parts of many existing loan modification plans and formalizing them 
this plan is in addition to the us government s tarp program  and other recent governmental interventions in the us credit markets 
given the size and scope of these governmental actions  they will likely affect many of the market risks described above 
as these initiatives are developed and their effects become more apparent we will continue to seek to take them into account in managing the risks inherent in our business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies and the possible effect of changes in estimates on our financial results and statements are discussed below 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition when recognizing revenue on consolidated earning assets  we generally employ the effective yield method and use assumptions about the future to determine an effective yield that drives amortization of premiums  discounts  and other net capitalized fees and costs associated with purchasing and financing real estate loans and securities 
loan premium amortization for consolidated real estate loans  the effective yield method is applied as prescribed under fas for loans acquired prior to july  we use coupon interest rates as they change over time and anticipated principal payments to determine an effective yield to amortize premiums or discounts 
when rates rise  our premium expense will likely be lower as we project the effective yields to be higher and  until the coupons reset higher  we need to amortize less of the premium to record the effective yield in each reporting period 
conversely  when rates fall  our premium expense will likely be higher as we project the effective yields to be lower and  until the coupons reset lower  we need to amortize less of the premium to record the effective yield in each reporting period 
for loans acquired after july   we use the initial coupon interest rate of the loans without regard to future changes in the underlying indices and anticipated principal payments on a pool basis to calculate an effective yield and to amortize the premium or discount 
the volatility in periodic amortization expense is dependent primarily on prepayments 
securities discount amortization for discount amortization on our consolidated securities  an effective yield is applied by projecting cash flows that incorporate assumptions of amount and timing credit losses  prepayment speeds  and interest rates over the remaining life of each asset 
if our assumptions prove to be accurate  then the yield that we recognize 
table of contents in the current period will remain the same over the life of the security 
we constantly review and update as necessary our assumptions and resulting cash flow projections based on historical performance  input  and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to generate future cash flows will prove to be accurate or that these estimates will not change materially 
the majority of our discount amortization is generated from residential and commercial securities purchased at a significant discount to par value 
to the extent we expect to incur credit losses  we set aside as a form of credit reserve a portion of this discount and this designated credit reserve is not amortized into income 
the level of this reserve is based upon our assessment of various factors including economic conditions  characteristics and delinquency status of the underlying loans  past performance of similar loans  and other factors 
thus  when credit losses do occur  they are recorded against this reserve and there is no income statement impact at that time 
the difference between the amount of our total discount and the designated credit reserve is the accretable discount 
the accretable discount represents the amount of discount amortization that we expect to recognize into income over the remaining life of an asset 
as we update our estimate of future credit losses  increases in projected losses will increase the discount set aside as reserve resulting in less accretable discount for amortization into income and lower portfolio yields 
in contrast  lower credit loss projections will decrease the reserve and increase the accretable discount balance  increasing our ces discount amortization and resulting in higher portfolio yields 
the timing of projected receipt of cash flows from our ces is also an important driver in the effective yield 
slower actual or projected prepayment speeds will cause projected receipt of cash flows to be delayed and will reduce the rate of ces discount accretion resulting in a lower yield for the portfolio 
an increase in actual or projected prepayment speeds will generally result in a higher portfolio yield as a result of increased discount amortization 
amortization of abs issued premium we apply the effective yield method in determining amortization for the premium and deferred asset backed securities issuance cost for abs issued 
abs premium is recognized through our income statement as a reduction in interest expense and issuance costs are amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the abs issued 
similar to our calculation of amortization of premium and discounts on assets  the use of this method requires us to project cash flows over the remaining life of each liability 
these projections are primarily affected by forecasted prepayment rates of the pledged assets 
if prepayment speeds are faster than modeled  the average life of the liability will shorten  and we will recognize the abs net premium and deferred asset backed securities issuance costs at a faster rate  thereby decreasing net expense in the current period 
if prepayment speeds are slower than expected  the average life of the liability will lengthen  and it will take us longer to recognize the abs net premium  decreasing interest expense in the current period 
establishing valuations and accounting for changes in valuations the fair values we report for our financial assets and liabilities reflect what we believe we would realize if we chose to sell our assets  or would have to pay if we chose to buy back our abs issued liabilities 
this is consistent with gaap requirements even though we may have no intent on selling these assets  nor would we be forced to sell since we currently have no recourse debt funding these securities  and we generally do not intend to repurchase our liabilities 
establishing fair values in thinly traded or essentially closed markets is inherently subjective and is dependent upon many market based inputs  including observable trades  information on offered inventories  bid lists  and indications of value obtained from dealers 
obtaining fair values for securities is especially difficult for more illiquid securities  such as ours  and is made more difficult when there is limited trading visibility  as has been the case in recent quarters 
where there are observable sales  many of them are from distressed sellers  and their sales tend to further depress asset prices 
for these reasons  we expect market valuations to continue to be highly volatile 
fair values for our assets and liabilities are dependent upon a number of market based assumptions including future interest rates  prepayment rates  discount rates  credit loss rates  and the timing of credit losses 
we use these assumptions to generate cash flow estimates and internal values for each individual security 
our valuation process relied on our internal values to estimate the fair values of our securities at 
table of contents december  we also request indications of value marks from third party dealers every quarter to assist in the valuation process for all of our assets and liabilities 
for december   we received dealer marks on of our assets and of our liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the aggregate  our internal valuations of the securities on which we received dealer marks were lower than the aggregate dealer marks at december  our internal valuations of our abs issued on which we received dealer marks were higher than the aggregate dealer marks at december  in assessing the third party dealer marks that we receive  it appears that some measures have been taken to enhance the quality of these marks  as they more closely approximated our internal fair value estimates in the fourth quarter of than in recent prior quarters 
however  there were fewer third party generated data points available to us at december   than in prior quarters  in part because some dealers no longer exist and others have ceased providing client valuation services 
accounting under fas effective january  we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
this gives us the option to elect to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities  and firm commitments at fair value  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
one of the chief objectives of this standard was to provide better matching of the accounting results to the economic activities underlying them 
for example  there may be assets or liabilities that are measured under the historical cost models while related transactions eg hedging derivatives or offsetting transactions are at fair value 
the election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in earnings 
we elected the fair value option on january   for the assets and liabilities of acacia and certain other securities 
fas allowed for a one time election for these existing positions upon adoption  which resulted in a billion cumulative effect transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings on january  our decision to adopt fas for new financial instruments is generally based upon our funding strategy for the specific financial asset acquired 
for example  securities that we anticipate funding with equity will generally be accounted for as afs securities under fas securities that we anticipate funding with a combination of debt and equity or are or may be financed through securitization liabilities will generally be accounted for at fair value under fas along with the corresponding liabilities 
mark to market adjustments the rules regarding mtm accounting are complex and may not clearly reflect the underlying economics 
this accounting and economic discussion is intended to provide investors with a better understanding of the impact of mtm adjustments on our reported financial results 
all changes in fair value for securities or derivatives accounted for as trading instruments or under the fair value option of fas flow through the income statement 
these adjustments can be either positive or negative from period to period 
positive changes in the fair value of afs securities from period to period are accounted for as increases to stockholders equity and do not flow through our income statement 
accounting for negative changes in the fair value of afs securities from period to period requires a three step process involving a combination of quantitative and judgmental evaluations 
the diagram and discussion that follows details the three step process for evaluating impairments on afs securities 

table of contents 
graphic missing 
afs securities are deemed impaired if the fair value is below amortized cost 
an assessment is then required as to whether the impairment is temporary and is reflected as unrealized losses in the balance sheet  or is other than temporary ott and realized through the income statement as market valuation adjustments 
the first step in this assessment is to determine whether there has been an adverse change in the underlying cash flows generated by the security 
it is difficult to separate with precision how much of the change in fair value is driven by changes in expected cash flows versus changes in market discount rates  but during periods of market illiquidity and uncertainty as we have encountered since late  the market discount rate impact can be significant 
the third step is to determine whether we have the ability and intention to hold the security 
the third step requires us to evaluate whether an impaired security will recover in value within a reasonable period of time 
this step is very subjective  particularly when there is turmoil and uncertainty in the capital markets 
if  based on our assessment  we have an other than temporary impairment  then the basis of the security is written down to its fair value through our income statement 
market valuation adjustments of this type could be substantial  reducing gaap income and causing a loss 
however  for securitized assets  reductions in fair values may not affect our cash flows or investment returns at all  or may not affect them to the degree implied by the accounting write down 
a security can be considered ott impaired even if the change in projected cash flows is small relative to the resulting mtm adjustment 
so while ott impaired securities cannot be written back up through mtm adjustments in our income statement  this does not mean the underlying security could not recover in value 
if the cash flows generated by the security perform better than the decline in fair value might indicate  we could recognize this benefit through higher interest yields over time 
allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment for consolidated real estate loans held for investment  we establish and maintain credit reserves that we believe represent probable credit losses that will result from intrinsic losses existing in our pool of consolidated real estate loans held for investment as of the date of the financial statements 
the reserves for credit losses are adjusted by taking provisions for credit losses recorded as a reduction in interest income on real estate loans on our consolidated statements of loss income 
the reserves consist of estimates of specific loan impairment and estimates of collective losses on pools of loans with similar characteristics 

table of contents to calculate the reserve for credit losses for real estate loans  we determine intrinsic losses by applying loss factors default  the timing of defaults  and the loss severity upon default that can be specifically applied to each pool of loans and estimate expected losses of each pool over their expected lives 
once we determine the loss factors  we then estimate the timing of these losses and the losses probable to occur over an effective loss confirmation period 
this period is defined as the range of time between the probable occurrence of a credit loss such as the initial deterioration of the borrower s financial condition and the confirmation of that loss the actual charge off of the loan 
the losses expected to occur within the estimated loss confirmation period are the basis of our credit reserves because we believe those losses exist as of the reported date of the financial statements 
we do not maintain a loan repurchase reserve  as any risk of loss due to loan repurchases ie  due to breach of representations would normally be covered by recourse to the companies from whom we acquired the loans 
accounting for derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage certain risks such as interest rate risk 
we may also acquire derivative financial instruments as investments 
derivative instruments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value 
if a derivative instrument has a positive fair value  it is reported as an asset 
if the fair value is negative  the instrument is reported as a liability 
changes in fair values of derivative instruments are reported either through the income statement or through our equity 
for derivatives accounted for as trading instruments  all changes in the fair values are recognized through the income statement 
for interest rate agreements a type of derivative accounted for as a cash flow hedge  most of the changes in fair values are recorded in our balance sheet through equity 
only the ineffective portions as determined according to the accounting principle of the derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges are included in income 
using derivatives may increase our earnings volatility  as the accounting results for derivatives may not match the accounting results for the hedged asset or liability due to our inability to  or decision not to  meet the requirements for certain accounting treatments  or if the derivatives do not perform as intended 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide a discussion about market risks in item of this annual report on form k 
to supplement these discussions  the table below incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market value risks on our consolidated balance sheets 
this table presents just one scenario regarding potential future principal prepayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities  based on certain underlying assumptions 
there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as anticipated 
future sales  principal repayments  acquisitions  calls  and restructuring could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
for our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of repayment 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented  based on the characteristics of our existing portfolio 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with the interest rate scenario 
actual prepayment speeds will likely vary from these assumptions 
furthermore  this table does not include anticipated credit losses and assumes all of the principal we are entitled to receive will be received 
as discussed in item of this annual report on form k  the actual amount and timing of credit losses will affect the principal payments and effective rates during all periods 
our future earnings are sensitive to a number of factors including those discussed in item of this annual report on form k and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
in addition  one of the key factors in projecting our income is the reinvestment rate on new assets and there is no reinvestment assumed in this table 
the composition of our balance sheet and the set of assumptions used at december  differ from those used at december  the assumptions we use reflect the market conditions at the date of the 
table of contents financial statements  so the future interest rates assumed and corresponding prepayment speeds used to project the cash flows differ from those used a year ago 
however  the overall results are similar in that our future results still depend greatly on the credit performance of the underlying loans although the tabular information assumes no credit losses  future interest rates as many of our assets are adjustable rate  prepayment behavior on residential real estate loans  and our ability to invest our capital also not included in this tabular information
