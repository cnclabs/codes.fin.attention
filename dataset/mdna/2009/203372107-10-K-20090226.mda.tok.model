item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
on december   we acquired andrew for approximately billion in cash and million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
the acquisition of andrew is significant to us and historical financial information for periods prior to the acquisition may not be indicative of our financial condition and performance for future periods 
overview commscope  inc is a world leader in infrastructure solutions for communication networks 
through our andrew brand  we are a global leader in radio frequency subsystem solutions for wireless networks 
through our systimax and uniprise brands  we are also a world leader in network infrastructure solutions  delivering a complete end to end physical layer solution  including cables and connectivity  enclosures  intelligent software and network design services  for business enterprise applications 
we are also the premier manufacturer of coaxial cable for broadband cable television networks and one of the leading north american providers of environmentally secure cabinets for digital subscriber line dsl and fiber to the node fttn applications 
backed by strong research and development  commscope combines technical expertise and proprietary technology with global manufacturing capability to provide customers with infrastructure solutions for evolving global communications networks in more than countries around the world 
net sales for increased by  million  or  to  million as compared to due primarily to the acquisition of andrew 
net sales for legacy andrew product lines during were  million 
net sales of million for the four day period from december  to december  are included in the andrew sales for operating income loss for decreased to million from million in  primarily due to a charge for goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of million 
net income loss decreased to million for compared to million for  reflecting the reduction in operating income and the increase in interest expense as a result of the significant borrowings undertaken to finance the andrew acquisition 
during the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the primary sources of revenue for our accg segment were product sales of primarily passive transmission devices for the wireless infrastructure market including base station antennas  coaxial cable and connectors  and microwave antennas and secure environmental enclosures for electronic devices and equipment used by wireline and wireless telecommunications providers 
demand for accg segment products depends primarily on capital spending by telecommunication providers to expand their distribution networks or to increase the capacity of their networks 
the primary source of revenue from our enterprise segment was sales of structured cabling solutions to large  multinational companies  primarily through a global network of distributors  system integrators and value added resellers 
the segment also includes coaxial cable for various video and data applications  other than cable television 
demand for enterprise segment products depends primarily on information technology spending by enterprises  such as communications projects in new buildings or campuses  building expansions or upgrades of network systems within buildings  campuses or data centers 
the primary source of revenue for our broadband segment was product sales to cable television system operators 
demand for our broadband segment products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television system operators for maintaining  constructing and rebuilding or upgrading their systems 
the primary source of revenue for our wns segment were sales of active electronic devices and services including power amplifiers  filters and tower mounted amplifiers  geolocation products  network optimization analysis systems  and engineering and consulting services as well as products that are used to extend and enhance the coverage of wireless networks in areas where signals are difficult to send or receive such as tunnels  subways  airports and commercial buildings 
demand for wns segment products depends primarily on capital spending by telecommunication providers to expand their distribution networks or increase the capacity of their networks 

table of contents our future financial condition and performance will be largely dependent upon global spending by wireless service providers and oems  global spending by business enterprises on information technology  investment by telecommunication companies in the communications infrastructure  overall global business conditions  our ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants  ongoing integration of andrew with the commscope organization  our ability to manage costs successfully among our global operations  and the other factors set forth in item a of this form k 
our profitability is also affected by the mix and volume of sales among our various product groups and between domestic and international customers and competitive pricing pressures 
we have experienced significant increases and greater volatility in raw material prices during the past several years as a result of increased global demand  supply disruptions and other factors 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of increases in raw material price volatility through effective requirements planning  working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms and implementing price increases 
delays in implementing price increases  failure to achieve market acceptance of future price increases  or price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
the following critical accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events 
it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a description of all of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue comes from product sales 
revenue from product sales is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer and revenue is measurable 
revenue is not recognized related to product sold to contract manufacturers that the company anticipates repurchasing in order to complete the sale to the ultimate customer 
some of our customer arrangements include sales of software and services 
revenue for software products is recognized pursuant to the provisions of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
the fair value of each revenue element is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value determined by stand alone pricing of each element 
these contracts typically contain post contract support pcs services which are sold both as part of a bundled product offering and as a separate contract 
revenue for pcs services is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs contract 
other service revenue is typically recognized when the service is performed 
revenue for certain of our products is derived from multiple element contracts 
the fair value of the revenue elements within these contracts is based on stand alone pricing for each element in accordance with the guidance provided in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and related interpretations 

table of contents reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs we record estimated reductions to revenue for potential sales returns as well as customer programs and incentive offerings  such as discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs 
these estimates are based on contract terms  historical experience  inventory levels in the distributor channel and other factors 
management believes it has sufficient historical experience to allow for reasonable and reliable estimation of these reductions to revenue 
however  deteriorating market conditions could result in increased sales returns and allowances and potential distributor price protection incentives  resulting in future reductions to revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of our customers to make payments  focusing on customer financial difficulties and age of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or market principle  including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
these reserves are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog  shipment experience  forecasted demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions deteriorate from those anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
product warranty reserves we recognize a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under our customer warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of our products 
the product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty five years from the date of sale  depending upon the product subject to the warranty 
we record a provision for estimated future warranty claims based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revise our estimates  as appropriate  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
restructuring during  we recorded significant restructuring charges primarily related to employee severance and the direct costs of exiting leased facilities pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
restructuring charges represent our best estimate of the associated liability at the date the charges are recognized 
adjustments for changes in assumptions are recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period they become known 
differences between actual and expected charges and changes in assumptions could have a material effect on our restructuring accrual as well as our consolidated results of operations 
tax valuation allowances and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider the amounts and timing of expected future deductions or carryforwards and sources of taxable income that may enable utilization 
we maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
changes in the amount or timing of expected future deductions or taxable income may have a material impact on the level of income tax valuation allowances 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future  an increase to an income tax valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
we recognize income tax benefits related to particular tax positions only when it is considered more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained if examined on its technical merits by tax authorities 
the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is evaluated to be greater than likely to be realized 
considerable judgment is required to evaluate the technical merits of various positions and to evaluate 
table of contents the likely amount of benefit to be realized 
based on developments in tax laws  regulations and interpretations  changes in assessments of the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions could have a material impact on the overall tax provision 
we establish deferred tax liabilities for the estimated tax cost associated with foreign earnings we expect to repatriate to the us these liabilities are subject to adjustment if we change the amount of foreign earnings we expect to repatriate or the foreign jurisdiction from which such repatriation will come 
we also establish allowances for value added and similar tax recoverables when it is considered probable that those assets are not collectible 
changes in the probability of recovery or in the estimates of the amount recoverable are recognized in the period such determination is made and may be material to earnings 
contingent liabilities we are subject to a number of contingent liabilities  including product warranty claims and legal proceedings  among others  that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position 
we consider whether a reasonable range of such contingent liabilities can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise our estimates 
it is possible that actual outcomes will differ from assumptions and material adjustments to the liabilities may be required 
purchase price allocation recording the acquisition of andrew or any other acquisition and the required purchase price allocation under generally accepted accounting principles requires considerable judgment 
tangible assets and liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values based on observable market values or management judgment 
separable intangible assets are identified and valued 
in the absence of market transactions  the valuation of such assets is generally estimated based on subjective discounted cash flow dcf methods 
for amortizable intangible assets  a remaining useful life is selected  which requires estimates regarding the future periods that will benefit from the assets 
impairment reviews of definite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  is the authoritative standard on the accounting for the impairment of definite lived intangible and other long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 management reviews definite lived intangible assets  investments and other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
this analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an intangible asset impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of the assets 
if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
during the three months ended december   as a result of reduced expectations of future cash flows from certain identified intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of andrew  we determined the carrying value of these assets was not recoverable 
a pretax impairment charge of million was recognized primarily related to certain customer relationship intangible assets 
the impairment charge equals the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  which is determined using the estimated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets during the three months ended december  is basis points higher than that used in the original valuation as a result of changes in market conditions subsequent to the acquisition date 
while our cash flow assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in estimating the cash flows attributable to our definite lived intangible assets and in selecting the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the assets 
impairment reviews of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives have been tested for impairment annually as of august for reporting units within the broadband 
table of contents and enterprise segments and as of october for reporting units within the accg and wns segments 
in addition  these assets are also tested for impairment on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected from these assets 
changes in operating performance  market conditions and other factors may adversely impact estimates of expected future cash flows 
any impairment indicated by this analysis would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value  estimated by management based on market prices  if available  or forecasted cash flows  discounted using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve significant management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
due to uncertain market conditions  it is possible that future impairment reviews may indicate additional impairments of goodwill and or other intangible assets  which could result in charges that are material to our results of operations 
during the three months ended december   management determined that an indication of potential goodwill impairment existed due to the sustained decrease in the company s market capitalization below book value along with the consideration of certain budgeting activities that indicated lower operating results for certain reporting units than had previously been forecasted 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  our reporting units are generally determined to be one level below the operating segment level and are not aggregated 
we use a dcf method for determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
this method considers the future cash flow projections of the reporting unit and those projections are discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
although our cash flow forecasts used in the dcf method are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in projecting the cash flows attributable to these businesses 
we also consider our market capitalization as of the date we perform the analysis 
based on the estimated fair values generated by our dcf models  all three reporting units within the accg segment that have goodwill assigned to them failed step one of the goodwill impairment test required under sfas no 
of the three reporting units within the wns segment with goodwill balances  two reporting units failed step one 
neither the broadband nor enterprise segments failed step one 
after performing step two of the goodwill impairment analysis as required under sfas no 
 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million related to the wns and accg segments  respectively 
the key assumptions in our dcf models are the discount rates  annual revenue growth rates and average annual operating income margins 
the discount rates applied to the cash flows by reporting unit represent the weighted average cost of capital and ranged from to 
the discount rates used generally increased approximately basis points from those used in the andrew purchase price allocation and basis points from those used in the august annual impairment test performed for the broadband and enterprise segments 
the annual revenue growth rates used ranged from to in the current models as compared to to in the andrew purchase price allocation and the broadband and enterprise segments annual impairment test 
finally  the average annual operating income margins used ranged from to as compared to a range of to in the andrew purchase price allocation and broadband and enterprise segments annual impairment test 
the following table highlights the sensitivity of our goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant 
wns segment accg segment incremental intangible impairment incremental goodwill impairment incremental intangible impairment incremental goodwill impairment in millions increase of basis points in discount rate decrease of basis points in operating income margin decrease of basis points in annual revenue growth rate 
table of contents an increase of basis points in the discount rate would have resulted in a step one failure for one additional reporting unit within the wns segment  however  this reporting unit would not have recognized an impairment charge under the step two analysis 
additional impairment charges may occur in the future due to changes in the estimated discount rates  projected operating margins or projected revenue growth rates  among other factors 
the broadband and enterprise segments would not have recognized impairment charges under the above sensitivity analysis 
pension and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are developed from actuarial valuations 
critical assumptions inherent in these valuations include the discount rate  health care cost trend rate  rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates 
assumptions are subject to change each year based on changes in market conditions and in management s assumptions about future events 
changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on future pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities 
the discount rate enables management to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we estimate that a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased benefit expense in by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased benefit expense in by million

net sales for legacy andrew product lines during were  million and are included in the accg and wns segments 
for further details by segment  see the section titled segment results below 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for increased by million to  million primarily due to the acquisition of andrew 
gross profit for was adversely affected by million of purchase accounting adjustments  primarily related to the effect on cost of sales of the step up of the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value less the costs to sell the inventory 
cost of sales for includes amortization of purchased intangibles of million as compared to million for our gross profit margin for was compared to for the prior year 
the gross profit margin for  excluding the impact of the purchase accounting adjustments and incremental amortization expense 
table of contents discussed above  was 
the adjusted gross profit margin for is lower than reflecting legacy andrew products whose historical gross profit margins were lower than those of commscope and a reduction in certain legacy commscope product lines  particularly in the broadband segment see the section titled segment results below 
selling  general and administrative expense the increase in selling  general and administrative expense sg a was primarily due to the acquisition of andrew 
included in sg a for is a benefit of million related to the release of a liability resulting from the alignment of certain employee benefit policies between legacy commscope and legacy andrew 
also included in are acquisition and integration related costs of million 
the reduction in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales is a result of the higher sales levels and reflects cost savings synergies 
research and development research and development r d expense increased by million to million during primarily as a result of the andrew acquisition 
r d expense as a percentage of net sales increased to for as compared to for this increase in r d expense as a percentage of net sales reflects the higher level of r d spending required to support the andrew products  particularly those in the wns segment 
r d activities generally relate to ensuring that our products are capable of meeting the developing technological needs of our customers  bringing new products to market and modifying existing products to better serve our customers 
for the year ended december   legacy andrew s r d expenditures were million 
a substantial amount of legacy andrew s recent r d activities were focused on filter products and have been impacted by the restructuring in late of our relationship with nokia siemens networks  a major filter products customer 
legacy andrew s r d activities are undertaken for new product development and for product and manufacturing process improvement 
restructuring costs we recognized pretax restructuring costs of million during compared with million during the restructuring costs include million of charges related to the closure of the company s legacy commscope belgian and brazilian manufacturing facilities and a million charge related to the closure of the company s legacy commscope australian manufacturing facility 
the belgian and brazilian facilities have primarily supported the broadband segment  while the australian facility supported the enterprise segment 
the majority of the remainder of the restructuring costs resulted from workforce reductions at several facilities 
the restructuring costs incurred during resulted from an effort to lower the overall manufacturing cost structure of the company following the andrew acquisition and in response to a slowdown in demand for most major product groups 
we have announced the consolidation of certain legacy andrew cable and antenna production operations  which will result in the closure of locations in the stratford  england area and changes at other facilities 
the costs associated with this initiative million are recognized as an adjustment to the purchase price allocation 
we expect to substantially complete these restructuring actions by late additional restructuring initiatives related to the andrew integration or cost reduction efforts are being evaluated and any resulting charges could be material 
as a result of restructuring and consolidation actions  there is unutilized real estate at various facilities in the us and internationally 
we are attempting to sell or lease this unutilized space 
as additional restructuring initiatives are implemented  additional excess real estate or equipment may be identified and impairment charges  which may be material  may be incurred 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible asset impairments during the three months ended december   we determined that an indication of potential goodwill impairment existed due to the sustained decrease in the company s market capitalization below book value along with the consideration of certain budgeting activities that indicated lower operating results for certain reporting units than had been previously forecasted 
completion of the goodwill impairment analysis resulted in a charge of million 
also during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of certain identified intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of andrew were not recoverable 
a pretax impairment charge of million was recognized primarily related to certain customer relationship intangible assets 
due to uncertain market conditions  it is possible that future impairment reviews may indicate additional impairments of goodwill and or other intangible assets  which could result in charges that are material to our results of operations 
other income expense  net net other expense for includes million of foreign exchange losses 
also included in net other expense for is a million charge related to the induced conversion of million of our senior subordinated convertible debentures  million in fees paid to amend our senior secured credit facilities  and a million charge related to impairment of our auction rate securities 
net interest income expense we incurred net interest expense of million during compared to recognizing net interest income of million for this change is the result of the significant borrowings undertaken and the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that were utilized to finance the andrew acquisition 
our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including the interest rate swap and amortization of long term financing costs  was as of december  compared to as of december  interest expense for includes a million charge related to ineffectiveness on the interest rate swap entered into to fix the interest rate on a portion of the debt incurred to finance the andrew acquisition 
also included in interest expense for is a million charge related to the write off of deferred financing fees related to the million of principal prepayments during on our senior secured term loans 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the loss before income taxes for includes of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges for which we have recognized million in tax benefits 
the loss before income taxes also includes million of charges primarily related to restructuring initiatives for which we do not expect to realize tax benefits 
the merger of the legacy andrew brazilian entity into the legacy commscope brazilian entity resulted in the partial release of valuation allowances carried against the legacy commscope brazilian net operating loss carryforwards 
this release provided a million benefit to our tax provision for also included in the income tax provision for is a benefit of million related to the settlement of various us and foreign income tax audits 
the effective rate excluding these items was for our effective tax rate reflects the benefits derived from significant operations outside the us  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of  partially offset by us state income taxes and valuation allowances for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which we cannot record tax benefits 
the effective tax rate excluding the items noted above decreased from primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings as a result of the andrew acquisition 
segment results the pro forma information provided below is intended to show how commscope s results might have looked if the acquisition of andrew had occurred as of january  the andrew amounts included in this 
table of contents pro forma information are based on andrew s actual results and  therefore  may not be indicative of the actual results when operated as part of commscope 
no pro forma adjustments have been made other than combining commscope s historical results with those of andrew 
the pro forma financial information should not be relied upon as being indicative of the historical results that would have been realized had the acquisition occurred as of the date indicated or that may be achieved in the future

net sales in the accg segment benefited from changes in foreign exchange rates in in  higher sales of microwave antennas  base station antennas and cable products were offset by significantly lower domestic wireline sales as compared to the pro forma sales in wireline sales declined primarily due to weaker demand for cabinet and apparatus products by major domestic telecommunication service providers 
we expect demand for our accg products to be positively affected by wireless capacity expansion in emerging markets and growth in mobile data services in developed markets 
uncertainty in the global economy may slow capital spending by telecommunication providers and negatively impact both of these markets and consequently our net sales 
operating income for the accg segment for includes million of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments  approximately million of incremental intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price allocation from the andrew acquisition and the negative impact of million from the step up of inventory to its estimated fair value as a result of the application of purchase accounting to the acquisition of andrew 
these increased costs were partially offset by a million benefit 
table of contents related to the alignment of certain employee benefit policies between legacy commscope and legacy andrew 
operating income for and pro forma operating income for include million and million  respectively  for acquisition related costs 
excluding these special items  accg operating income increased in as compared to pro forma primarily due to improved performance of the segment s wireless products  cost reductions and the benefit of the price increases for selected cable products 
these improvements were somewhat offset by weaker wireline operating income in the current year periods due to declining sales 
enterprise the decline in enterprise segment net sales in as compared to is due to lower domestic sales 
this decline was somewhat offset by a modest increase in international net sales in all major regions  particularly in europe  middle east and africa and central and latin america 
in response to higher raw material costs in the first half of the year  price increases for certain cable products were announced in the second and third quarters of these price increases provided modest benefits to net sales during the second half of we expect demand for enterprise products to be driven by the ongoing need for bandwidth and high performance structured cabling in the enterprise market and affected by global information technology spending 
the deterioration of global economic conditions and a slowdown in commercial construction activity is expected to negatively affect demand for our products 
enterprise segment operating income for includes a million benefit related to the alignment of certain employee benefit policies between legacy commscope and andrew 
operating income was adversely affected by a million increase in restructuring costs for compared to excluding these special items  enterprise segment operating income for is modestly higher than despite declining net sales primarily due to an ongoing shift in mix toward higher margin products  cost reduction efforts and the impact of price increases to offset the effect of increases in raw material costs 
broadband broadband segment net sales declined in as compared to due to a decrease in domestic and european sales that was partially offset by stronger sales in central and latin america 
the slowdown in purchasing by our domestic customers is largely attributable to the deterioration in general economic conditions  particularly the residential housing market 
the increase in central and latin american sales reflects continued spending on new projects and system maintenance 
net sales for includes an incremental benefit of million related to a business that was acquired in we expect demand for broadband products to continue to be influenced by the domestic slowdown in the residential construction market 
spending by our broadband customers on maintaining and upgrading networks is expected to continue  though it may be influenced by the deterioration in global economic conditions and the tight credit markets 
the reduction in broadband segment operating income for as compared to is due in part to an increase of million in restructuring charges  primarily resulting from the closure of the belgium and brazil manufacturing facilities 
although broadband segment operating income benefited modestly from price increases announced earlier in  the impact of pricing was more than offset by the impact of higher raw material prices in the first half of  lower production volume due to the decline in domestic sales  a shift in mix toward less profitable products and product warranty charges of million in related to an isolated manufacturing defect 
broadband segment operating income for includes a million benefit related to the alignment of certain employee benefit policies between legacy commscope and andrew 
continued volatility in raw material costs and a sustained slowdown in purchasing by cable system operators may limit the improvement in operating income 
further restructuring initiatives are expected in to align broadband cost structures with lower sales volumes 

table of contents wireless network solutions wns segment net sales decreased during compared to pro forma primarily due to the divestiture of the satellite communications satcom product line on january  satcom sales for were million as compared to million for pro forma the satcom sales subsequent to the divestiture relate to manufacturing transition services 
excluding the impact of satcom  wns segment net sales decreased during as compared to pro forma  primarily due to lower sales of power amplifiers and filters as well as the impact of divesting other product lines 
net sales in the wns segment benefited from changes in foreign exchange rates in we expect demand for our wns products to be positively affected by the continuing expansion of wireless capacity in emerging markets and growth in mobile data services in developed markets 
uncertainty in the global economy may slow capital spending by telecommunication providers and negatively impact both of these markets and consequently our net sales 
operating income for the wns segment for includes charges of million related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairments  approximately million of incremental intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price allocation of the andrew acquisition and the negative impact of million from inventory related purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the acquisition of andrew 
operating income for and pro forma operating income for include million and million  respectively  for litigation charges and acquisition related costs 
wns operating income for has been favorably affected by reduced satcom losses as a result of the sale of the satcom product line as well as the restructuring of our relationship with nokia siemens networks for custom filter production 
outlook commscope expects very challenging business conditions during the company s ability to forecast with normal levels of confidence has been negatively affected by global economic turmoil  uncertainties in credit markets  currency fluctuations and commodity cost volatility 
continued volatility in the pricing of commodities and other of our raw materials could have a significant impact on our net sales and operating profitability 
the volatility in these prices may reduce gross margin if we delay implementing price increases  are unable to achieve market acceptance of future price increases or implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in these prices 
we have taken steps to reduce our operating costs in anticipation of weaker net sales in than in to the extent these market conditions continue to worsen  we may have to take further steps to reduce the level of our operating costs 
over the long term  we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the growing need for greater bandwidth  strong growth in wireless data traffic  and growth opportunities in china  india and other emerging markets

the objectives of the global manufacturing initiatives were to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to enhance the company s long term competitive position 
implementation of these initiatives includes shifting significant enterprise and broadband segment cable production capacity among our global facilities  consolidating operations at the csmi omaha facility into one building and closing a broadband segment manufacturing facility in scottsboro  alabama in late no additional charges are expected to be incurred in conjunction with the global manufacturing initiatives 
net interest income net interest income during was million compared to million during this improvement is primarily due to higher interest income from the significantly higher balances of invested cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that existed throughout most of as a result of completing the acquisition of andrew on december   we added a significant level of debt and reduced the level of invested cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december   reflecting primarily the borrowings associated with the andrew acquisition 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for compared to for excluding the impact of the gain on the ofs brightwave note receivable

we implemented price increases for certain enterprise products primarily in the first half of as a result of significant increases in the cost of raw materials 
the increase in operating income is attributable in large part to increased sales volume  changes in the product mix towards products that generate higher margins and the impact of cost control efforts 
the price increases that were realized were substantially offset by the impact of increased raw material costs 
also contributing to the improved operating income in is a million reduction in restructuring costs 
broadband higher sales in north america and central and latin america accounted for the majority of the increase in broadband segment net sales in as compared to these increases reflect the impact of higher sales volumes as well as the impact of price increases implemented primarily in the first half of in response to higher raw materials costs 
domestic sales volume increases can be attributed to continued infrastructure needs of our large cable television system operator customers 
increases in international sales volumes  particularly in the central and latin america region  are a result of new projects and ongoing system maintenance

our principal sources of liquidity  both on a short term and long term basis  are cash and cash equivalents  cash flows provided by operations and availability under credit facilities 
the primary uses of liquidity include funding working capital requirements primarily inventory and accounts receivable  net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  debt service requirements  capital expenditures  payment of certain restructuring costs and funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during was primarily driven by million of principal payments on our senior secured term loans  million disbursed in conjunction with exchanging all of the convertible debentures assumed in the andrew acquisition into merger consideration  the payment of million as part of the merger consideration paid to former andrew shareholders as their andrew shares were presented and the payment of million of restructuring costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million in net cash flow from operations 
the decrease in long term debt was primarily the result of million of principal payments on our senior secured term loans  the exchange of all of the convertible debentures for merger consideration and the negotiated conversion of a portion of the convertible debentures into shares of our common stock 
the decline in total capitalization was primarily driven by the decrease in long term debt and the net loss and other comprehensive net loss for the year

the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily attributable to the decline in net sales during the fourth quarter of as compared to the comparable prior year period  on a pro forma basis 
the decrease in inventory reflects the sale during of the inventory that had been increased to its estimated fair value  less costs to sell  as a result of the application of purchase accounting rules and efforts to more efficiently manage working capital by reducing inventory levels 
a primary driver in the reduction of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities is the million of restructuring costs paid during investing activities investment in property  plant and equipment during increased by million over to million largely due to capital expenditures made by the acquired andrew business 
we currently expect total capital expenditures of million to million in the expected capital spending during is primarily for expanding and upgrading production capability  cost reduction efforts  software capitalization and investments in information technology

we paid million of restructuring costs during and expect to pay the majority of the million liability for restructuring initiatives by the end of we made contributions of million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans during and currently expect to make contributions of million in as of december   we have a significant unfunded obligation related to pension and other postretirement benefits 
we are not required to make a contribution to our us pension plans under relief provided by the worker  retiree and employer recovery act of to achieve funding levels required under the pension protection act of and similar requirements outside the us  we may make additional contributions in and expect to make contributions in subsequent years and these contributions could be material 
we expect that our noncurrent employee benefit liabilities will be funded through cash flow from future operations 
our convertible senior subordinated debentures are subject to a repurchase right at a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest at the option of the holders on march  on february   we notified holders of our debentures that we were exercising our right under the indenture governing the debentures to redeem all of the outstanding debentures on march  the redemption date at a price  in cash  equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
as of february   million in aggregate principal amount of these debentures was outstanding 
our revolving credit facility  under our senior secured credit facilities  will be permanently reduced by an amount equal to of the amount  if any  by which our cash redemptions or repurchases of the debentures exceeds million 
accordingly  we may exchange shares of our common stock for debentures in advance of the redemption date in lieu of redeeming the debentures for cash if and as favorable opportunities arise 
we believe we will have sufficient available cash to redeem all debentures that remain outstanding on the redemption date 
in connection with our senior secured credit facilities  we are required to comply with two primary financial covenants an interest coverage ratio for the preceding twelve months  which is tested at the end of each fiscal quarter  and a consolidated leverage ratio  with which we must comply at all times 
as of december   the minimum interest coverage ratio and the maximum consolidated leverage ratio permitted under the senior secured credit facilities were both to the company s estimated interest coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio as of december  were to and to  respectively 
beginning with the quarter ending september   the minimum interest coverage ratio increases to to and the maximum consolidated leverage ratio decreases to to beginning with the quarter ending september   the minimum interest coverage ratio increases further to to and the maximum consolidated leverage ratio decreases further to to the company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the senior secured credit facilities as of december  and plans to remain in compliance throughout if we are unable to comply with these covenants  we will be in default under our senior secured credit facilities  which could result in  among other things  the outstanding balance of our term loans becoming due and payable immediately  a material increase in the interest rate and further restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility 

table of contents we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations  combined with availability under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs  including cash requirements related to restructuring initiatives or other costs related to the andrew integration and any cash payments in connection with the redemption of our debentures

effects of inflation and changing prices we continually attempt to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and adjusting our selling prices 
the principal raw materials purchased by us copper  fabricated aluminum  steel  plastics and other polymers  bimetals and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets 
prices for copper  fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have increased substantially and then decreased and become highly volatile over the last several years 
as a result  we have increased our prices for certain products and may have to increase prices again in the 
table of contents future 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales volume or must implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs  these cost changes could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments  among other methods  to hedge some of these exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the table below summarizes the combined interest and principal payments associated with the variable rate term loans and interest rate swap we entered into in connection with the andrew acquisition see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the principal payments presented below are based on the scheduled maturities in the credit agreement including the estimated excess cash flow payment of million that is expected to be paid in march 
the interest payments presented below assume the interest rate in effect as of december  and include the impact of the interest rate swap  which serves to fix a portion of the interest payments on our variable rate debt 
the projected future payments on the interest rate swap reflected in the table below are based on the forward interest rate curve in effect as of the date of the table 
settlement of the fair value of this hedging instrument as of december  would have resulted in a loss of approximately million  net of tax 
the unrealized loss on this cash flow hedge is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on projected future interest payments related to the unhedged portions of the term loans is also included in the table below 
for the year ended december  there after total fair value principal and interest payments on variable rate term loans average interest rate interest rate swap payments impact of an increase in interest rates of basis points foreign currency risk approximately and of our and net sales  respectively  were to customers located outside the us significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our international sales levels and the related collection of amounts due 
in addition  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
conversely  significant increases in the value of currencies as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect profitability as certain product costs increase relative to a us dollar denominated sales price 
the foreign currencies to which we have the greatest exposure include the euro  chinese yuan  brazilian real and the indian rupee 
we continue to evaluate alternatives to help us reasonably manage the market risk related to foreign currency exposures 
as of december   we held a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange swap agreement  which hedges a portion of our euro denominated asset exposure 
under the swap agreement  we receive interest in us dollars and pay interest in euros 
the notional amount of the agreement is million  the expected cash payments in are million and the fair value as of december  was million 
the agreement matures in december we also use derivative instruments such as forward exchange contracts to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
these instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculation 
these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are marked to market each period through earnings and  as such  there were no unrecognized gains or losses as of december  or 
table of contents commodity price risk materials  in their finished form  account for a large portion of our cost of sales 
these materials  such as copper  fabricated aluminum  steel  plastics and other polymers  bimetals and optical fiber  are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets and supply and demand levels  among other factors 
management attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
as of december   we evaluated our commodity pricing exposures and concluded that it was not currently practical to use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current commodity price risks 
however  in response to volatility in the commodity markets  we have entered into forward purchase commitments for certain metals to be used in the normal course of business 
as of december   we were obligated to purchase approximately million of metals under take or pay contracts through the end of that we expect to take and consume in the normal course of operations 
due to the decline in commodity prices during the last half of  most of these commitments were above market prices as of december
