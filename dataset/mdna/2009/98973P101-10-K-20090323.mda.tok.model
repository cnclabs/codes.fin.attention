item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview ziopharm oncology  inc is a biopharmaceutical company that is seeking to develop and commercialize a diverse  risk sensitive portfolio of in licensed cancer drugs that can address unmet medical needs through enhanced efficacy and or safety and quality of life 
our principal focus is on the licensing and development of proprietary small molecule drug candidates that are related to cancer therapeutics already on the market or in development and can be administered by intravenous iv and or oral capsule forms of administration 
we believe this strategy will result in lower risk and expedited drug development programs with product candidates having a low cost of manufacturing to address changing reimbursement requirements around the world 
while we may commercialize our products on our own in north america  we recognize that favorable clinical trial results can be better addressed by partnering with companies with the requisite financial resources 
the company could also negotiate the right to complete development and marketing in certain geographies especially for certain limited niche indications 
although we are currently in phase i and or ii studies for three product candidates identified as darinaparsin zinapar tm  zio  palifosfamide zymafos tm  zio  and indibulin zybulin tm  zio  with limited capital resources the company s focus is on palifosfamide and more specifically on completing initial enrollment of the ongoing randomized phase ii trial with palifosfamide to support a registration trial for palifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin in the front and second line setting of soft tissue sarcoma 
we anticipate the initiation of such a trial as early as the first half of 
table of contents zio or darinaparsin is an anti mitochondrial organic arsenic compound covered by issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in foreign countries 
a form of commercially available inorganic arsenic arsenic trioxide 
trisenox  ato has been approved in the united states and the european union for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia apl  a precancerous condition 
ato is on the compendia listing for the therapy of multiple myeloma  and has been studied for the treatment of various other cancers 
nevertheless  ato has been shown to be toxic to the heart  liver  and brain  which limits its use as an anti cancer agent 
ato carries a black box warning for ecg abnormalities since arsenic trioxide has been shown to cause qt interval prolongation and complete atrioventricular block 
qt prolongation can lead to a torsade de pointes type ventricular arrhythmia  which can be fatal 
inorganic arsenic has also been shown to cause cancer of the skin and lung in humans 
the toxicity of arsenic is generally correlated to its accumulation in organs and tissues 
our preclinical and clinical studies to date have demonstrated that darinaparsin is considerably less toxic than inorganic arsenic  particularly with regard to cardiac toxicity 
in vitro testing of darinaparsin using the national cancer institute s human cancer cell panel detected activity against a series of tumor cell lines including lung  colon  brain  melanoma  ovarian  and kidney cancer 
moderate activity was detected against breast and prostate cancer 
in addition to solid tumors  in vitro testing in both the national cancer institute s cancer cell panel and in vivo testing in a leukemia animal model demonstrated substantial activity against hematological cancers cancers of the blood and blood forming tissues such as leukemia  lymphoma  myelodysplastic syndromes  and multiple myeloma 
preliminary results indicate significant activity against the hut cutaneous t cell lymphoma  the nk gmi natural killer cell nhl  karpas t cell nhl  su dhl b cell nhl  su dhl b cell nhl and su dhl b cell nhl cell lines 
preclinical studies have also established anti angiogenic properties of darinaparsin and provided support for the development of an oral capsule form of the drug  and established synergy of darinaparsin in combination with other approved anti cancer agents 
phase i testing of the intravenous form of darinaparsin in solid tumors and hematological cancers has been completed 
the company has reported clinical activity and  importantly  a safety profile from these studies as predicted by preclinical results 
the company is nearing completion of phase ii studies in advanced myeloma  in certain other hematological cancers  and primary liver cancer 
in addition  the company is completing two phase i studies with an oral capsule form of darinaparsin 
preliminary favorable results from the trial with iv administered darinaparsin in hematologic cancers have been reported 
initial study results indicate efficacy and a favorable safety profile in various types of blood cancers 
in the ongoing phase i trials  preliminary reported data in solid tumors indicate the oral form is active and well tolerated 
the company is actively seeking a partner or partners  or other sources of funding  to progress both the iv and oral programs into phase ii study in particular sub types of non hodgkin s lymphoma 
if we cannot find a partner to fund the development of either one or both forms of darinaparsin  we would intend to complete the ongoing studies which are included in the company s current estimate of expenses and then discontinue the development program for darinaparsin 
zio or palifosfamide  is the active metabolite of ifosfamide  a compound chemically related to cyclophosphamide 
patent applications covering proprietary forms of palifosfamide for pharmaceutical composition and method of use have been filed in the us and internationally 
like cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide  palifosfamide is an alkylating agent 
the company believes that cyclophosphamide is the most widely used alkylating agent in cancer therapy  with significant use in the treatment of breast cancer and non hodgkin s lymphoma 
ifosfamide has been shown to be effective at high doses in the treatment of sarcoma and lymphoma  either by itself or in combination with other anticancer agents 
ifosfamide is approved by the us food and drug administration fda as a treatment for testicular cancer while ifosfamide based treatment is a standard of care for sarcoma  although it is not licensed for this indication by the us food and drug administration 
preclinical studies have shown that palifosfamide has activity against leukemia and solid tumors 
these studies also indicate that palifosfamide may have a better safety profile than ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide because it does not appear to produce known toxic metabolites of ifosfamide  such as acrolein and chloroacetaldehyde 
acrolein  which is toxic to the kidneys and 
table of contents bladder  can mandate the administration of a protective agent called mesna  which is inconvenient and expensive 
chloroacetaldehyde is toxic to the central nervous system  causing fuzzy brain syndrome for which there is currently no protective measure 
similar toxicity concerns pertain to high dose cyclophosphamide  which is widely used in bone marrow and blood cell transplantation 
palifosfamide has evidenced activity against ifosfamide and or cyclophosphamide resistant cancer cell lines 
also in preclinical cancer models  palifosfamide was shown to be orally active and encouraging results have been obtained with palifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin  an agent approved to treat sarcoma 
following a phase i dose escalation study  phase ii testing of the intravenous form of palifosfamide as a single agent to treat advanced sarcoma has been completed 
in both phase i and phase ii testing  palifosfamide has been administered without the uroprotectant mesna  and the toxicities associated with acrolein and chloroacetaldehyde have not been observed 
with an earlier form of palifosfamide  that has been substituted in the clinic with a new form  kidney toxicity fanconi s syndrome and acute renal failure were reported primarily at doses significantly higher than the dose currently used in clinical trials 
in clinical study to date with the new form  there have been no reports of kidney toxicity and palifosfamide has been otherwise well tolerated 
the company reported clinical activity of palifosfamide when used alone in the phase ii study addressing advanced sarcoma 
following review of the preclinical combination studies  clinical data  and discussion with sarcoma experts  the company initiated a phase i dose escalation study of palifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin in patients with metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma 
in light of the reported favorable phase ii clinical activity data and with the combination of palifosfamide with doxorubicin well tolerated in the phase i trial and evidencing activity enrollment completed  study ongoing  the company has initiated a phase ii randomized controlled trial to compare doxorubicin plus palifosfamide to doxorubicin alone in patients with front and second line metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma 
data from the initial patients in this trial are expected to shape a registration trial in the same setting which is expected to initiate as early as the first half of the company is also developing an oral capsule form of palifosfamide to be studied clinically following further data from the iv trials and partnering or other sources of funding and is considering other phase ii trials in other solid tumors as funding becomes available 
orphan drug designation for palifosfamide has been obtained in both the united states and the european union for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas 
indibulin is a novel  orally available small molecular weight inhibitor of tubulin polymerization that was acquired from baxter healthcare and is the subject of numerous patents worldwide  including the united states  the european union and japan 
the microtubule component  tubulin  is one of the more well established drug targets in cancer 
microtubule inhibitors interfere with the dynamics of tubulin polymerization  resulting in inhibition of chromosome segregation during mitosis and consequently inhibition of cell division 
a number of marketed iv anticancer drugs target tubulin  such as the taxane family members  paclitaxel taxol  docetaxel taxotere  the vinca alkaloid family members  vincristine and vinorelbine  and the new class of epothilones with ixempra tmmarketed 
this class of agents is typically the mainstay of therapy in a wide variety of indications 
in spite of their effectiveness  the use of these drugs is associated with significant toxicities  notably peripheral neurotoxicity 
preclinical studies with indibulin demonstrate significant and broad antitumor activity  including activity against taxane refractory cell lines 
the cytotoxic activity of indibulin was demonstrated in several rodent and human tumor cell lines derived from prostate  brain  breast  pancreas  lung  ovary  and cervical tumor tissues and in rodent tumor and human tumor xenograft models 
in addition  indibulin was effective against multidrug resistant tumor cell lines breast  lung  and leukemia both in vitro and in vivo 
indibulin is potentially safer than other tubulin inhibitors 
no neurotoxicity has been observed at therapeutic doses in rodents and in the ongoing phase i trials 
indibulin has also demonstrated synergy with approved anti cancer agents in preclinical studies 
the availability of an 
table of contents oral capsule formulation of indibulin creates significant commercial opportunity because no oral capsule formulations of paclitaxel or related compounds are currently on the market in the united states 
indibulin has completed a phase i trial in europe and two additional phase i trials are nearing completion in the us in patients with advanced solid tumors 
the company has reported signs of clinical activity at well tolerated doses using a continuous dosing scheme without the development of clinically relevant peripheral neuropathy 
following encouraging results obtained with indibulin in combination with erlotinib  and fu in preclinical models  two phase i combination studies have been enrolled with tarceva and xeloda and are reaching interim completion 
preclinical work with consultant dr 
larry norton is continuing to explore dose scheduling for the clinical setting 
with the data from the phase i single agent and combination studies showing activity and with a dose limiting toxicity not yet reached  the company has decided to continue the indibulin development program with a focus on dr 
norton s dose scheduling findings and  with the availability of additional funding  with dose escalation to maximum tolerated dose using a schedule selected from the preclinical work 
although we intend to continue with clinical development of darinaparsin for lymphoma in conjunction with a partner  of palifosfamide for soft tissue sarcoma and of indibulin for solid tumors  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to accurately predict 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially  adversely affect our business 
to date  we have not received approval for the sale of any drug candidates in any market and  therefore  have not generated any revenues from our drug candidates 
development plan our development plan for the next twelve months is focused on completing the first patients in the randomized phase ii trial for palifosfamide  partnering darinaparsin  and further establishing dose scheduling and maximum tolerated dose with indibulin 
we expect our principal expenditures during those months to be predominately for palifosfamide and include clinical trial expenses  clinical trial expenses  including the close down and data collection expenses for darinaparsin and indibulin  costs related to the manufacturing of palifosfamide for the first patients in the palifosfamide randomized phase ii trial  rent for our facilities  and general corporate and working capital  including general and administrative expenses 
we intend to use senior advisors  consultants  clinical research organizations  and other third parties to perform certain aspects of product development  manufacturing  clinical  and preclinical development  and regulatory  safety and quality assurance functions 
with the planned development of palifosfamide and continued collection of indibulin data  with the intention of partnering further development of darinaparsin following completion of ongoing studies  and with other adjustments in our project and personnel expenses  including a recent workforce reduction of four positions in february and other loss of personnel  following the initial patient enrollment and assuming no additional capital from financing or partnering  we expect to incur  during the next twelve months  approximately million on preclinical and regulatory expenses  approximately million on clinical expenses including clinical trials that we expect to be triggered under the license agreements relating to our product candidates  approximately million on manufacturing costs  approximately million on facilities  rent  and other facilities related costs and approximately million on general corporate and working capital 

table of contents with our current cash position  adjustments in staffing  aggressive cash management strategy and amortization of prepaid expenses  we believe that we currently have sufficient capital that will support our current operations strategy into the second quarter of our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  the costs to complete development of products and the cost to commercialize our future products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this report 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
product candidate development and clinical trials intravenous darinaparsin  organic arsenic  has been or is being tested in patients with advanced myeloma  other hematological malignancies  and liver cancer 
two separate phase ii trials have been completed with a third nearing completion 
recently reported positive results in patients with lymphoma have led to the expansion of the hematological trial focusing on non hodgkin s lymphoma 
the phase i trials with an oral form of darinaparsin are ongoing in solid tumors and have been also expanded to include non hodgkin s lymphoma patients 
the company is in actively seeking partners and other sources of funding for continuing the development program of both the iv and oral forms in certain sub types of non hodgkin s lymphoma 
if funding or partnering is not accomplished  the project will be terminated 
intravenous palifosfamide  the proprietary form of isophosphoramide mustard  is being developed presently to treat soft tissue sarcoma 
a phase ii trial in advanced sarcoma has been completed 
a phase i trial in combination with doxorubicin is fully enrolled with treatment still ongoing and with the combination well tolerated  evidencing activity  and with the dose combination established for further study 
the company has initiated a randomized controlled phase ii trial designed to compare palifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin to doxorubicin alone in the front or second line treatment of metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma and intends to treat initial patients to develop a registration trial to initiate as early as the first half of an oral formulation has also been developed preclinically and  following further iv study results  additional funding or partnering  a phase i is expected to initiate 
other trials in solid tumors are under consideration pending further funding 
orphan drug designation has been obtained for both the united states and the european union for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas 
technology transfer and scale up for the commercial manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final product specification will continue as resources allow 
indibulin  a novel anti cancer agent that targets mitosis by inhibiting tubulin polymerization  is administered as an oral capsule formulation 
indibulin has completed a phase i trial in europe and two additional phase i trials are nearing completion in the united states with preliminary results reported for all three trials 
phase i trials of indibulin in combination with tarceva and also with xeloda have been initiated and enrolled 
preclinical studies under the direction of dr 
larry norton to support clinical study of dose dense and metronomic dosing are well underway 
pending further results from the norton preclinical work and available funding  the company intends to further study indibulin with an identified schedule and to determine maximum tolerated dose prior to formal phase ii testing in a selected solid tumor 
if further funding is not available  the project will be placed on hold 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  versus december  revenues 
we had no revenues for the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased by  or  to  from  in the year ended december  decreased research and development expenses in the current year are primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in clinical research and development expenses due to the company prioritizing the clinical trial direction along with cost management 
the decrease in research and development is also attributable to a decrease of approximately  in manufacturing related costs 
these decreases were offset by approximately  due to increased payroll and related expenses in 
table of contents general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to  from  in the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately  in investor relations and financial consulting costs  a decrease of approximately  in payroll  stock compensation  and related expenses  a decrease of approximately  in patent and related expenses  and a decrease of approximately  in recruiting expenses 
these decreases were slightly offset by an increase of approximately  in legal fees 
other income expense 
other income decreased by  or  to  in the year ended december  from  recorded in the year ended december  other income during the year ended december  and  respectively  was comprised of interest income 
the decrease is due to a lower average cash balance and the drop in the return from our investments  primarily in us treasuries and money market funds as compared to the previous period 
net income loss 
for the reasons described above  the net loss increased by  or  to  in the year ended december  from  for the same period of results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  versus december  revenues 
we had no revenues for years ended december  and research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased by  or  to  from  in the year ended december  increased research and development expenses in were primarily attributable to an approximately million increase in the cost of clinical trials  clinical milestone  and regulatory related expenses  an increase of million in preclinical related expenses  and an increase of approximately million in manufacturing related costs 
the increase in expenses was also attributable to an increase of approximately million in payroll and employee related costs as a result of our increasing headcount and an approximate increase of million in non cash stock compensation expense related to grants of stock options 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  from  in the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase of approximately  in financial consulting costs  approximately  for investors relations services  approximately million in legal and patent related fees  approximately million in rent and related facility expenses  approximately million for recruiting expenses  approximately million for travel  meals  and other related expenses  and approximately million for insurance  utilities  and office supply related expenses 
the increase in expense was also attributed to an increase of approximately million in payroll and employee related costs resulting from our increasing headcount 
these increases were offset by an approximate million decrease in stock compensation expenses relating to grants of stock options recorded in the year ended december  other income expense 
other income increased by  or  to  in the year ended december  from  recorded in the year ended december  other income during the year ended december  and  respectively  comprised interest income 
the increase was due to higher cash balances  which was derived from our february  private placement of common stock and warrants that was made available for investing purposes 
we received approximately million in the net proceeds from this private placement 
net income loss 
for the reasons described above  the net loss increased by  or  to  in the year ended december  from  for the same period of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  down from million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  given the rate at we have historically used cash  the limited amount of cash for use in operations and the recent instability in the capital markets  we have taken measures to reduce our near term expenses while we seek additional financing and partnering arrangements for the development of certain drug candidates 
we have reduced staffing  including a recent 
table of contents workforce reduction of four positions in february and other personnel and project related expenses  and have focused our priorities  including changes in our clinical trial program and seeking a partner to continue the further development of darinaparsin 
if we cannot find a partner to fund the development of either one or both forms of darinaparsin  we intend to discontinue the development of darinaparsin following the completion of ongoing trials for which associated expenses are included in the current forecast 
if we are able to obtain additional financing  further studies will progress with regard to indibulin 
based on our current costs saving plan  we believe that we currently have sufficient capital to fund the development programs for palifosfamide into the second quarter of see development plan 
because our business does not generate any cash flow  however  we will need to raise additional capital to continue development of the palifosfamide beyond that time or to continue development of our other product candidates 
to the extent additional capital is not available when we need it  or if we cannot successfully enter into partnership agreements for the further development of our products  we may be forced to abandon some or all of our development efforts  which would have a material adverse effect on the prospects of our business 
further  our assumptions relating to the expected costs of development and commercialization and timeframe for completion are dependent on numerous factors other than available financing  including significant unforeseen delays in the clinical trial and regulatory approval process  which could be extremely costly 
in addition  our estimates assume that we will be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in each clinical trial 
the company anticipates that losses will continue for the foreseeable future 
at december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our actual cash requirements may vary materially from those planned because of a number of factors including changes in the focus and direction of our development programs  competitive and technical advances  costs associated the development of palifosfamide and indibulin and the further financing of darinaparsin development by a partner  and costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and any other intellectual property rights  or other developments 
in order to continue our long term plans for clinical trials and new product development  we will need to raise additional capital to continue to fund our research and development as well as operations after we exhaust our current cash resources 
we expect to finance our cash needs through the sale of equity securities and strategic collaborations or debt financings or through other sources that may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that any such financing can be realized by the company  or if realized  what the terms thereof may be  or that any amount that the company is able to raise will be adequate to support the company s working capital requirements until it achieves profitable operations 
currently  we have no committed sources of additional capital 
recently  capital markets have experienced a period of unprecedented instability that we expect may severely hinder our ability to raise capital within the time periods needed or on terms we consider acceptable  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development and regulatory approval of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all our research and development programs

accounting for income taxes  requires us to establish a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against those net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets long lived assets primarily include property and equipment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results
