item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
overview we are a diversified oil and gas industry supplier  and have three reportable segments fluids systems and engineering  mats and integrated services  and environmental services 
we provide these products and services principally to the e p industry in the us gulf coast  west texas  us mid continent  us rocky mountains  canada  mexico  brazil  united kingdom uk and certain areas of europe and north africa 
further  we are expanding our presence outside the e p sector through our mats and integrated services segment  where we are marketing to utilities  municipalities  and government sectors 
as previously reported  we had entered into an agreement in april to sell our us environmental services business to ccs  inc ccs 
in october  the federal trade commission ftc filed suit seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent us from concluding this sale to ccs 
in november  we reached a mutual agreement with ccs to terminate our agreement 
following the termination of this agreement  the us environmental services business  which has been previously reported within discontinued operations  is now reported in continuing operations as a third reportable segment of the company 
our results include million of legal and transaction costs associated with the sale process  along with million of non cash asset write offs following the abandonment of the sale 
a key element of our previously communicated strategic plan is to leverage our existing operations to drive further expansion into high growth international markets 
during  we made significant progress in expanding our presence in the brazilian market 
as announced during the first quarter of  we were awarded a significant deepwater offshore project  and completed the construction of a million fluids plant to serve this market 
deliveries under this contract began during the third quarter of and we have generated million of revenue during in this growing market 
also  during the fourth quarter  we signed a major contract with petroleo brasileiro sa petrobras  to provide drilling fluids and related services for both onshore and offshore locations beginning in this contract is valued by petrobras at approximately million brazilian reals approximately million at the february  exchange rate and is expected to have a term of years 
in february  our board of directors approved a plan authorizing the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares for an aggregate price of approximately million 
we also repurchased  shares for an aggregate price of million for shares surrendered in lieu of taxes under vesting of restricted stock awards 
hurricane impact our fluids systems and engineering and environmental services operations along the us gulf coast were severely affected by hurricanes katrina and rita in and early during  we recorded recoveries related to business interruption coverage related to the hurricanes of million and million as reductions to cost of revenues  in the fluids systems and engineering and environmental services segments  respectively 
in  these us gulf coast operations were impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike  which again interrupted business activities 
insurance claims associated with the business interruption are expected to be finalized in  and the insurance recoveries  if any  will be recorded at the time of final claim resolution 
results of operations our operating results depend in large measure on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as on the depth of drilling  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
these levels  in turn  depend on oil and gas commodity pricing  inventory levels and product demand 

table of contents the current economic recession  the instability in the credit markets  and declines in commodity prices has significantly impacted drilling activity during the fourth quarter of this trend has continued into the first quarter of this decline in e p spending negatively impacted operating results during the fourth quarter of  and is expected to negatively impact operating results in  as compared to the results achieved during rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
key average north american rig count data for the last three years ended december is as follows year ended december  vs vs count count us rig count canadian rig count total source baker hughes incorporated the north american rig count was  during the week of february   reflecting a decline from the average of  summarized financial information for our reportable segments is shown in the following table net of intersegment transfers year ended december  vs vs in thousands segment revenues fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services total segment revenues segment operating income fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services total segment operating income general and administrative expenses operating income segment operating margin fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services includes million of insurance recoveries as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in total segment operating income increased to million  as compared to million in revenues and segment operating income are further analyzed in the segment analysis below 
fluids systems and engineering revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following for the years ended december  and year ended december  vs in thousands north america mediterranean and south america total drilling fluid and engineering revenues completion fluids and services industrial minerals total north american drilling fluid and engineering revenues increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  while north american rig activity increased during this period  the number of rigs we serviced through this business segment increased  reflecting continued market share growth within the markets that we service 
in the year ended december   our mediterranean and south american revenues increased over this revenue increase was driven largely by the increased rig activity and continued market penetration into the north african and eastern european markets  along with a million increase in revenues generated in brazil in revenues in our completion fluids and services business increased for the year ended december   as compared to  due to strong demand for rental equipment and services for well completion activities in the mid continent region served by this business 
revenues in our industrial minerals business increased for the year ended december   as compared to  resulting from a increase in sales volume  along with significant pricing increases to help offset higher barite transportation costs 
operating income operating income for this segment increased million for the year ended december  on a million increase in revenues  compared to  resulting in a decrease in operating margin from to 
of the total segment change  north american operations generated a million increase in operating income on a million increase in revenues  while international operations generated a million increase in operating income on a million increase in revenues 
within the international operations  the incremental profits associated with higher revenues were somewhat offset by higher operating expenses attributable to personnel  higher transportation and logistics costs due to the location of projects  and start up costs associated with new contracts 
as described above  the north american rig activity declined significantly at the end of and in early as a result  we expect that revenues and operating income will be negatively impacted by the lower activity and resulting pricing pressures 
internationally  we anticipate that activity will remain more stable than in the north american markets  and we anticipate revenue growth in brazil  as compared to levels 

table of contents mats and integrated services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following for the years ended december  and year ended december  vs in thousands mat rental and integrated services mat sales total total mat rental and integrated services revenues decreased by million in the year ended december   compared to as a million increase in revenues generated by the colorado business acquired in august was more than offset by a million decline in rental and related service volume in the gulf coast region  driven largely by weakness in the south louisiana land rig count in compared to mat sales primarily consist of export sales of composite mats to various international markets  as well as domestic sales to the us government and customers outside the oil and gas industry 
mat sales increased by million in  as compared to  due primarily to higher domestic sales activity 
operating income mats and integrated services operating income decreased by million to million for the year ended december  on a million decrease in revenues compared to  resulting in a decrease in operating margins to from 
the decrease in operating margin is partially attributable to the change in sales mix 
the colorado business acquired in august generated an increase in rental and service revenues of million in year ended december   however  operating income from this business were unchanged over this period  as incremental profits generated by the higher revenues were offset by higher expenses  including a million increase in depreciation and amortization related to acquired assets 
operating income for the remaining operations in this segment  which primarily service the gulf coast area  declined by million on a million decline in revenue 
as noted above  this million decline in revenue included a million decrease in rental and integrated services revenue  offset by a million increase in mat sales 
the decline in gulf coast operating income is primarily due to the lower rental and integrated service revenues  as these activities have a relatively high fixed cost structure 
in addition  the gulf coast service business was negatively impacted by additional pricing pressure resulting from the significantly lower rig counts in the region throughout also  the business recorded million of pre tax charges in related primarily to inventory and receivable write downs  transportation costs for the re deployment of rental mats  as well as severance and related costs associated with restructuring activities in this segment 
environmental services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following for the years ended december  and year ended december  vs in thousands e p waste gulf coast e p waste west texas norm and industrial waste total 
table of contents e p waste revenues in the gulf coast region decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to volumes processed by this region declined during this period  reflective of the decline in gulf coast rig activity during this period 
this decline in volumes processed was partially offset by changes in sales mix and pricing increases 
e p waste revenues in west texas increased by to million in the year ended december  compared to volumes processed by this region declined during this period  however  this was more than offset by improvements in pricing 
also  this region generated million of additional revenues from the sale of oil  which is a by product of the waste disposal process 
the increase in oil revenues is the result of the high commodity prices experienced during norm and industrial waste revenues increased by to million in the year ended december   compared to operating income environmental services operating income decreased by million to million for the year ended december  on a million increase in revenues compared to  reflecting a decrease in operating margins to from 
the year ended december  included a million charge to write down certain disposal assets which we have determined not to develop following the abandoned sale of the business in the fourth quarter of in addition  includes million of expenses associated with unrecoverable losses incurred at our gulf coast facilities associated with hurricanes ike and gustav 
the remaining million increase in operating income reflects the impact of the higher revenues 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from the increase is attributable to million of legal and related costs associated with the abandoned sale of the us environmental services business in the year ended december  also included million of expenses associated with the arbitration and anticipated settlement of a lawsuit with our former chief executive officer 
the year ended december  included million of legal expenses  including a million settlement charge  related to the shareholder class action and derivative litigation 
the remaining million increase in expenses in is primarily attributable to a million increase associated with performance based employee incentive programs 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense in will decrease from levels  due to the non recurring nature of certain items in  including the expenses associated with the abandoned sale of the us environmental services business and the settlement of the dispute with our former chief executive officer 
interest expense  net interest expense  net totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  included a million non cash charge to write off capitalized debt issuance costs associated with termination of the credit facilities in december the remaining million decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates throughout  as compared to at december   our weighted average interest rate on borrowings was  compared to at december  provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an income tax rate of  compared to an income tax rate of in the increase in effective tax rate from to is primarily attributable to a larger proportion of income being generated by our us operations in  which has a higher tax rate than our foreign jurisdictions 
we expect the effective tax rate in to be between and 

table of contents discontinued operations discontinued operations include the results of operations of the newpark environmental water solutions news business  which was exited in  a sawmill facility  which was sold in  and the canadian environmental services business  which was shut down in during the year ended december   discontinued operations generated a pre tax loss of million million after tax  which reflected remaining shut down expenses associated with these businesses 
during the year ended december   discontinued operations generated pre tax loss of million million after tax  which reflected the results of operations  as well as impairments and shut down expenses associated with the businesses 
pre tax losses from the disposal of discontinued operations were million million after tax for the year ended december   reflecting the loss generated on the sale of the sawmill facility assets during the third quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in total segment operating income increased from million in to million in revenues and segment operating income are further analyzed in the segment analysis below 
fluids systems and engineering revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following for the years ended december  and year ended december  vs in thousands north america mediterranean and south america total drilling fluid and engineering revenues completion fluids and services industrial minerals total north american drilling fluid and engineering revenues increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  overall north american rig activity was relatively unchanged during this period  as a increase in the us rig count was partially offset by a decrease in the canadian rig count 
the average number of north american rigs serviced by our business decreased by during this time 
this decrease in rigs serviced is primarily related to the weak canadian market as well as an industry shift toward drilling shallower conventional oil wells in the us market as compared to the deeper wells that we typically service 
the decrease in number of rigs serviced by this segment is more than offset by a increase in our average revenue per rig  resulting from our focused efforts to concentrate on deeper and more complex wells  including the off shore gulf coast markets 
mediterranean and south american revenues increased in the year ended december  over levels  representing of total segment revenues in  compared to in this increase was driven by increased rig activity and continued penetration into the north african and romanian markets 
revenues in our completion fluids and industrial minerals businesses increased million for the year ended december   or as compared to as increases in us sales activity was partially offset by declines in industrial minerals sales into the canadian market 

table of contents operating income operating income for this segment decreased million for the year ended december  on a million increase in revenues  resulting in a decline in operating margin from to 
north american operating income decreased million on a million increase in revenues  primarily due to million of non recurring insurance recoveries from hurricanes katrina and rita  which increased operating income in in addition  operating income was negatively impacted by higher operating costs  including significantly higher barite transportation costs  as well as the continued operating costs in the canadian business which has remained relatively flat  despite the decline in sales volumes 
the mediterranean region operating income increased million on a million increase in revenues from to  while the brazilian operation generated a million increase in operating losses  due to costs associated with the start up of operations 
mats and integrated services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following for the years ended december  and year ended december  vs in thousands mat rental and integrated services mat sales total total mat rental and integrated services revenues increased by million in the year ended december   compared to  primarily due to the sem acquisition in august  which contributed million of revenue during revenues for the gulf coast region increased by million  or over this increase is primarily attributable to improvements in market penetration  despite lower rig activity in this region compared to mat sales primarily consist of composite mats to international markets and export sales of wooden mats to canada 
the decline in mat sales is primarily attributable to a million decrease in canadian sales  due to lower drilling activity and a large one time wooden mat sale recorded in the remaining million increase in revenues is primarily attributable to composite mat export sales 
operating income segment operating income declined million for the year ended december  on a million decrease in revenues  compared to operating margins declined to for the year ended december  as compared to in the decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the impact of the change in mat sales volume

e p waste revenues in west texas decreased by to million in the year ended december  compared to norm and industrial waste revenues increased by to million in the year ended december   compared to operating income environmental services operating income increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to during  we recorded a million impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets of this business which was offset by million of insurance recoveries associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
the remaining million improvement in operating income is primarily attributable to the pricing improvements noted above  and operating cost reductions 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from legal expenses related to the shareholder class action and derivative litigation  including a million settlement charge  were million in  compared to million in the year ended december  also included million of expenses related to the internal investigation conducted by our audit committee which resulted in the restatement of financial statements for the year ended december  the remaining spending increase of million is primarily attributable to million of costs associated with the relocation of the corporate office  a million increase in stock based compensation expense  and salaries and other employee related expenses associated with the addition of new corporate executive officers and staff positions 
interest expense  net interest expense  net totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  includes a million non cash charge to write off capitalized debt issuance costs associated with termination of the credit facilities in december  while the year ended december  included million of charges associated with prepayment penalties and the write off of debt issuance costs 
the remaining million decrease is attributable to lower debt balances in provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an income tax rate of 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million  reflecting an income tax rate of

table of contents certain non deductible expenses  including a portion of the goodwill impairment recorded in the environmental services segment 
discontinued operations during the year ended december   discontinued operations generated a pre tax loss of million million after tax  which reflected the results of operations  as well as impairments and shut down expenses associated with the exited news  sawmill and canadian environmental services businesses 
during the year ended december   discontinued operations generated a pre tax loss of million million after tax  which included the operating losses of these discontinued businesses  along with a million charge for the impairment of long lived assets and other exit costs associated with the news business 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  totaled million 
net income adjusted for non cash items generated million of cash during the period  while increases in working capital used million of cash 
the increase in working capital during the period includes a million increase in receivables  resulting from the higher revenues generated and slower customer payments at the end of inventories also increased due to the higher revenues in  resulting in a usage of cash of million 
this usage was largely offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  also attributable to the increased level of business activities 
cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was million 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million  consisting primarily of capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily in our fluids systems and engineering segment which included million for the construction of the plant in brazil 
net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  totaled million  which included million to repurchase outstanding shares  largely offset by additional borrowings of million and million provided through purchases of equity by employees under company programs 
we anticipate that our working capital requirements for continuing operations will remain consistent with the changes in revenue in the near term 
in early  we anticipate the working capital requirements to decrease as a result of anticipated declines in revenues 
our capital expenditures budget of million was approved by our board of directors in january however  actual capital expenditures in are expected to be lower than the approved budget during the current period of lower drilling rig activity 
cash generated by operations and anticipated decreases in working capital levels  along with availability under existing long term credit agreements are expected to be adequate to fund our anticipated capital needs 
our long term capitalization was as follows as of december in thousands term credit facility revolving credit facility foreign bank lines of credit other total less current portion long term portion stockholder s equity total long term capitalization long term debt to long term capitalization 
table of contents in december  we entered into a million amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement with a five year term  expiring in december the credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility along with a million term loan term loan  which is to be repaid through annual principal repayments of million which began in december there are no prepayment penalties should we decide to repay the term loan in part or in full prior to the scheduled maturity dates 
we can elect to borrow under the credit agreement at an interest rate either based on the prime rate plus a margin ranging from to basis points or at libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points  both of which margins vary depending on our leverage 
as of december   million of the outstanding principal of the revolving credit facility is bearing interest at libor plus basis points  or  while the remaining million in outstanding principal is bearing interest at prime rate plus basis points  or 
in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the underlying libor rate on our borrowings under the term loan 
the initial notional amount of the swap agreements totaled million  reducing by million each december  matching the required principal repayments under the term loan 
as a result of the swap agreements  we will pay a fixed rate of plus the applicable libor margin  which was basis points at december   over the term of the loan 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balances under our credit agreement including the interest rate swaps as of december  and december  were and  respectively 
the credit agreement is a senior secured obligation  secured by first liens on all of our us tangible and intangible assets  including our accounts receivable and inventory 
additionally  a portion of the capital stock of our non us subsidiaries has also been pledged as collateral 
at december   million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding  including million required by insurance carriers in relation to our insurance programs 
in addition  we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december   leaving million of availability at that date 
the credit agreement contains covenants normal and customary for lending facilities of this nature 
the financial covenants include the following december  covenant fixed charge coverage ratio minimum consolidated leverage ratio maximum funded debt to captalization ratio maximum as noted above  we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  the credit agreement also contains covenants that allow for  but limit  our ability to pay dividends  repurchase our common stock  and incur additional indebtedness 
we expect to remain compliant with all covenants for our credit agreement in ava  spa  our european fluids systems and engineering subsidiary ava maintains its own credit arrangements consisting primarily of lines of credit with several banks  which are renewed on an annual basis 
we utilize local financing arrangements in our foreign operations in order to preserve credit availability under our corporate credit agreement  as well as to reduce the net investment in foreign operations subject to foreign currency risk 
advances under these short term credit arrangements are typically based on a percentage of ava s accounts receivable or firm contracts with certain customers 
the weighted average interest rate under these arrangements was at december  as of december   ava had a total of million outstanding under these facilities  including million reported in long term debt 
we do not provide a corporate guaranty of ava s debt 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with our insurance programs  we had established letters of credit in favor of certain insurance companies in the amount of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  as of december  and  we had established other letters of credit in favor of our suppliers in the amount of million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we had outstanding guarantee obligations totaling million and million  respectively  in connection with facility closure bonds and other performance bonds issued by insurance companies 
other than normal operating leases for office and warehouse space  barges  rolling stock and other pieces of operating equipment  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or special purpose entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements

for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits  see note income taxes to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item in this report 
we anticipate that the obligations and commitments listed above that are due in less than one year will be paid from operating cash flows 
the specific timing of settlement for certain long term obligations can not be reasonably estimated 
critical accounting policies critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states  which requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts and disclosures reported 
estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include the following allowances for sales returns  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for inventory obsolescence  reserves for self insured retentions under insurance programs  estimated performance and values associated with employee incentive programs  fair values used for goodwill impairment testing  undiscounted cash flows used for impairment testing of long lived assets and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
table of contents apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in the financial condition of our customers or political changes in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
since amounts due from individual customers can be significant  future adjustments to the allowance could be material 
for the years ended december   and  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in is partially attributable to the impact of the worldwide recession and slow down in industry activity in late allowance for sales returns we maintain reserves for estimated customer returns of unused materials in our fluids systems and engineering segment 
the reserves are established based upon historical customer return levels and estimated gross profit levels attributable to product sales 
inventory reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on the fair value of the inventory using factors such as our historical usage of inventory on hand  future expectations related to our customers needs  market conditions and the development of new products 
changes in oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
impairments of long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of november  or more frequently  if an indication of impairment exists 
the impairment test includes a comparison of the carrying value of net assets  including goodwill  of our reporting units with their estimated fair values  which we determine using a combination of a market multiple and discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
we identify our reporting units based on our analysis of several factors  including our operating segment structure  evaluation of the economic characteristics of our geographic regions within each of our operating segments  and the extent to which our business units share assets and other resources 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a decline in our market capitalization 
during this period  our average market capitalization was approximately million  whereas our book value was million at december  under statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the financial accounting standards board fasb requires the performance of an interim goodwill impairment test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we evaluated the movement in our stock price  along with our performance and the long term industry outlook  based on this evaluation  we concluded that we did not have a triggering event that would require the performance of an interim goodwill impairment test 
we will continue to monitor our market capitalization  along with other operational performance measures and general economic conditions 
a downward trend in one or more of these factors could cause us to reduce the 
table of contents estimated fair value of our reporting unit and recognize a corresponding impairment of our goodwill in connection with a future goodwill impairment test 
we review property  plant and equipment  finite lived intangible assets and certain other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we assess recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flows 
in estimating expected cash flows  we use a probability weighted approach 
should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable  an impairment is recorded 
as of december   no indication of impairment exists  however  a severe or prolonged economic recession could result in an impairment of assets in the future 
insurance we maintain reserves for estimated future payments associated with our self insured employee healthcare programs  as well as the self insured retention exposures under our general liability  auto liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
our reserves are determined based on historical cost experience under these programs  including estimated development of known claims under these programs and estimated incurred but not reported claims 
required reserves could change significantly based upon changes in insurance coverage  loss experience  or inflationary impacts 
as of december  and  total insurance reserves were million and million  respectively 
income taxes we have total deferred tax assets of million at december  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
at december   a total valuation allowance of million was recorded  substantially all of which offsets million of net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes  as well as foreign jurisdictions  including mexico and brazil 
no valuation allowance is recorded for our federal net operating loss carryforward 
changes in the expected future generation of qualifying taxable income within these jurisdictions or in the realizability of other tax assets  would result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which would be charged or credited to income in the period this determination was made

 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
fin became effective for us in as a result of the january  implementation of fin  we performed a comprehensive review of possible uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by fin and we recognized a liability of million resulting in a corresponding increase to the retained deficit balance at january  new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
sfas introduces a fair value hierarchy levels through to prioritize inputs to fair value and classifies the measurements for disclosure purposes 
this pronouncement applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas 
table of contents was effective for our fiscal year and interim periods within the fiscal year 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the underlying libor rate on our borrowings under our million term loan 
these swap agreements are valued based upon level fair value criteria under the guidelines of sfas  where the fair value of these instruments is determined using other observable inputs including quoted prices for similar assets liabilities and market corroborated inputs as well as quoted prices in inactive markets 
the fair value of the interest rate swap arrangements was a million liability  net of tax as of december  the fasb provided a one year deferral of the adoption of sfas no 
for certain non financial assets and liabilities under fasb staff position fsp  effective date of fasb statement no 

we elected to defer the adoption of the standard for these non financial assets and liabilities  and do not expect the impact of this statement to be material 
in october  the fasb issued staff position  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active

a company will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas was effective for our fiscal year and interim periods within the fiscal year 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as we elected not to adopt fair value accounting on applicable financial assets and liabilities

this standard changes the current guidance  requiring that all acquired assets  liabilities  minority interest and certain contingencies be measured at fair value  and certain other acquisition related costs be expensed rather than capitalized 
sfas r will apply to acquisitions that are effective after december   and we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
interest rate risk our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had total debt outstanding of million 
in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the underlying libor interest rate on our borrowings under the term loan portion of our credit facility 
the initial notional amount of the swap agreements totaled million  reducing by million each december  matching the required principal repayments under the term loan 
as of december   million remained outstanding under this term loan 
as a result of the swap agreements  we will pay a fixed rate of plus the applicable libor margin  which was basis points at december   over the term of the loan 
the remaining million of debt outstanding at december  bears interest at a floating rate 
at december   the weighted average interest rate under our floating rate debt was 
a basis point increase in market interest rates during would cause our annual interest expense to increase approximately million  resulting in a per diluted share reduction in annual earnings 
foreign currency our principal foreign operations are conducted in canada  mexico  brazil  uk and certain areas of europe and north africa 
we have foreign currency exchange risks associated with these operations  which are conducted principally in the foreign currency of the jurisdictions in which we operate which include european euros  canadian dollars and brazilian reals 
historically  we have not used off balance sheet financial hedging instruments to manage foreign currency risks when we enter into a transaction denominated in a currency other than our local currencies because the dollar amount of these transactions has not warranted our using hedging instruments 
unremitted foreign earnings permanently reinvested abroad upon which deferred income taxes have not been provided aggregated approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we have the ability and intent to leave these foreign earnings permanently reinvested abroad
