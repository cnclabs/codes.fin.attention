item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a solution driven organization that designs  develops  manufactures and sells cutting edge high grade power system solutions to the military defense  telecom datacom  industrial and medical industries 
our products serve a global market  with an emphasis on north america and europe 
revenues are generated from sales directly by our sales force and through a network of manufacturers representatives and distributors to oems and end users 
during the year ended december   our products were received well in the marketplace 
we intend to remain an innovative leader in the development of cutting edge custom power solutions  rugged power systems to meet harsh and extreme environmental requirements and high performance  high density and modular power system 
we also intend to continue to pursue our strategy of controlling production costs and insuring high quality products deliverable in a timely manner through production agreements with numerous contract manufacturers in asia 
while we believe our revenues have increased to a sufficient amount to offset our expenses  we may be subject to net losses in an individual quarter 
we believe that our cash will be sufficient to fund those losses for at least months 
foreign currency fluctuations our wholly owned subsidiary  gresham  operates using the united kingdom pound sterling 
therefore  we are subject to monetary fluctuations between the us dollar and the united kingdom pound sterling 
for the year ended december   we recorded a foreign currency translation loss of  in other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
for the year ended december   we recorded a foreign currency translation profit of  results of operations the table below sets forth certain statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december  and years ended december  revenues cost of revenues write off of excess inventory gross profit engineering and product development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income financial income income before tax benefit tax benefit net income the following discussion and analysis should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
we prepared the financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates  and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december   revenues decreased by to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues is mainly due to a decrease in sales of our commercial products in europe  as described below 
revenues derived from our defense products for the year ended december  were  or approximately the same as revenues of  from defense products for the year ended december  revenues derived from our commercial products for the year ended december  decreased by to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in commercial product revenue in resulted primarily from the rescheduling of shipments in the third and fourth quarters of by two of our larger european customers  and was not reflective of a broad based downturn in business 
to lessen any potential impact of similar decisions by specific customers in the future  we are implementing a new strategy to extend the distribution network to cover numerous new market segments 
in addition  we are focusing more on full custom power solutions which will enable us to collaborate more closely with our customers and therefore anticipate the timing of design cycles  shipments and other customer requirements 
revenues from our domestic operations increased by to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in product revenues is mainly attributed to increases in sales of our newer product lines with full custom power solution designs  offset partially by the decrease in demand for our certain of our legacy product lines as a result of the maturation of these products 
revenues from our european operations gresham decreased by to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues from gresham in is due to a decline in commercial product revenues resulting primarily from the rescheduling of shipments by two of our larger european customers during the third and fourth quarters of gross margins gross margins were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the higher gross margins in were primarily attributable to the continued outsourcing of our production to contract manufacturers in asia  cost reductions and variations in our product mix 
we believe that the most important factor in the substantial increase in gross margins was our strategic shift earlier in away from a dependence upon commoditized products to more integrated custom product solutions 
this value added platform of solutions  where we work in concert with our strategic customers and their partners  requires a more direct  consultative selling effort on our part 
we believe that some of this business may be of a seasonal nature and that it most likely will not signify similar increases in gross margin in the future 
engineering and product development engineering and product development expenses were of revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  actual dollar expenditures decreased by  to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to lower salary and consulting expenses  including the complete cessation of consulting contracts and corresponding consulting fees in selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were of revenues for the year ended december   compared to of revenues for the year ended december  actual dollar expenditures increased by  to  in from  in  mainly due to investing in company branding that included a new website  product labels and packaging and new collateral  together with an increase in travel and advertising expenses in  partially offset by a decrease in commissions 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were of revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  in actual dollars  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in from  in the increase in was primarily due to the accrual of liabilities in relation to the separation agreement with our former president and chief executive officer 
financial income  net net financial income was  for the year ended december   compared to net financial income of  for the year ended december  the increase in financial income in was due to foreign currency fluctuations during the respective periods offset partially by changes in the fair value of forward contracts 
from time to time  we enter into forward contracts to hedge certain sales transactions which are denominated in foreign currencies 
net income net income for the year ended december  was  or of revenues  an increase of  from the net income of  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in net income is primarily due to the significant increase in gross margins in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following are considered our most critical accounting policies that  under different conditions or using different assumption or estimates  could show materially different results on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from products when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  our price to our customer is fixed or determinable  no further obligation exists and collectibility is reasonably assured see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory obsolescence accruals we periodically assess our inventory valuation by reviewing revenue forecasts and technological obsolescence 
we write down the value of obsolescent or unmarketable inventory to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during and  we recorded inventory write offs of  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers located primarily in the us and europe 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and currently require no collateral from our customers 
an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses is maintained in anticipation of the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was  and  respectively 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  such as the result of bankruptcy or deterioration of the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of customers  and if the condition or circumstances of our customers deteriorates  estimates of the recoverability of trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if our estimates are determined to be greater than the actual amounts necessary  we may decrease a portion of such allowance in future periods based on actual collection experience 
other accrued liabilities our accrued liabilities are based on a variety of factors including past experience and  in many cases  require estimates if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
equity based compensation expense we account for equity based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires the exercise of judgment  including the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical pre vesting forfeitures 
if actual results differ from these estimates  equity based compensation expense  and therefore our results of operations  could be impacted 
liquidity and capital resources on december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of  and working capital of  this compares to cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of  and working capital of  on december  the decrease in working capital in is mainly due to a decrease in accounts receivable  decrease in accounts payable and related parties trade payables  and an increase in deferred revenue  offset partially by an increase in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was mainly due to decrease in trade receivables resulting from increased collection efforts  an increase in deferred revenues and other current liabilities  and an increase in accounts payable and related parties trade payables  offset partially by an increase in inventories due to a custom order backlog for net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in investing activities in was mainly due to reduced purchases of property and equipment during and a decrease in a short term deposit investment 
no cash was provided by financing activities in the year ended december   compared to  in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in was due to proceeds from the exercise of options 
our liquidity will be affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
as evidenced by the recent turmoil in the financial markets  credit has tightened 
we are reviewing our liabilities and capital structure to minimize any impact  and will pursue a strategy to mitigate any reductions in cash flow as a result of an economic slowdown by reducing capital expenditures and other discretionary spending 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months
