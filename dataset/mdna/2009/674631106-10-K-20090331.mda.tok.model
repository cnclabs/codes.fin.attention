management does not consider the excess deposits to be a significant risk 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amount of cash approximates its fair value 
the fair value of long term debt is based on current rates at which we could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities  and the carrying amount approximates fair value 
income taxes we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns

there are no capitalized costs of these two patents 
translation of canadian currency the accounts of our canadian subsidiary are translated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which requires that foreign currency assets and liabilities be translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
results of operations are translated using the average exchange rate prevailing throughout the period

performance comparisons n a liquidity and capital resources cash decreased in the year to approximately thousand dollars from approximately thousand dollars  a decrease of approximately thousand dollars 
the amount of short term borrowings outstanding at december  was approximately million dollars 
this is an increase of million dollars from the december   balance of approximately million dollars 
the decreased cash and increased borrowings are result of increased accounts receivable due from affiliated companies and an increase of inventories 
during the year ended december  the company continued to focus on programs to effectively manage accounts receivable trade 
in  net sales and accounts receivable remained close to their prior year levels trade accounts receivable aggregated approximately million dollars at both december  and in addition  inventory levels increased  from approximately million dollars to million dollars  comparing december  and  an increase of approximately thousand or 
the increase was mainly attributable to raw material price increases petroleum based chemicals from our vendors on key raw materials in addition to a vendor managed inventory program for one of our customers  increasing inventories approximately thousand dollars 
accounts payable at december  decreased to approximately million dollars from million dollars 
this decrease was offset by an increase in accrued payables of approximately million 
the primary sources of our liquidity are our operations and borrowings from regions bank pursuant to a revolving line of credit aggregating million 
in  the line carried interest based on the day libor rate plus basis points approximately at december  payable monthly  and was collateralized by the company s inventory  trade receivables  and intangible assets 
this financing matured on may   and was renewed for three years 
such line matures may   bears interest at the day libor plus basis points approximately at december  and is secured by our trade receivables  inventory and intangible assets 
we are required to maintain a minimum working capital of million and meet certain other financial covenants during the term of the agreement 
at december  and the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
as of december   and we were obligated under this arrangement in the amount of million dollars and million dollars  respectively 
in connection with the purchase and expansion of the alabama facility  we closed on industrial development bonds during the proceeds were utilized for both the repayment of certain advances used to purchase the alabama facility and to expand such facility for our future needs 
during july  we completed a second industrial development bond financing aggregating million through the city of montgomery  alabama 
such transaction funded an approximate  square foot addition to the manufacturing facility as well as the remaining machinery and equipment additions required therein 
this project was substantially completed during in order to market the industrial development bonds at favorable rates  we obtained a substitute irrevocable letter of credit for the issue and a new irrevocable letter of credit for the issue 
under such letters of credit agreements maturing on july   renewable annually  we are required to maintain a stipulated level of working capital  a designated maximum debt to tangible ratio  and a required debt service coverage ratio 
such letters of credit are secured by a first priority mortgage on the underlying alabama facility and equipment 
the bonds are marketed weekly at the prevailing rates for such tax exempt instruments 
during the year ended december  such bonds carried interest ranging between and annually 
the bonds when tendered by regions bank carry an interest rate of prime rate plus 
interest and principal are payable quarterly 
we believe current operations are sufficient to meet these obligations 
the bonds maturity dates are march and july for the and series bonds 
in september and october both bond issues were tendered due to the volatility of the credit markets 
both issues were successfully remarketed before year end 
on april  we entered into a financing obligation with regions bank whereby they advanced us  to finance equipment acquisitions at our kinpak facility 
such obligation is due in monthly installments of principal aggregating approximately  plus interest at prevailing rates 
the outstanding balance and interest rate on this obligation at december  was approximately  and interest rate is libor plus per annum or approximately at december  
we are involved in making sales in the canadian market and must deal with the currency fluctuations of the canadian currency 
we do not engage in currency hedging and deal with such currency risk as a pricing issue 
in the year ended december  the company recorded a thousand dollar foreign currency translation adjustment decreasing shareholders equity by thousand dollars as a result of the weakening of the canadian dollar in relationship to the us dollar  in the conversion of the company s canadian subsidiary balance sheet to us dollars 
during the past few years  we have introduced various new products to our customers 
at times this has required us to carry greater amounts of overall inventory and has resulted in lower inventory turnover rates 
the effects of such inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations 
we believe that all required capital to maintain such increases can continue to be provided by operations and current financing arrangements 
many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are petroleum chemical based and commodity chemicals that are subject to fluctuating prices 
the cost of petroleum and related products  major components in many of our products  which were already in an increasing cost spiral  became even more unstable in the practical dynamics of our business do not afford us the same pricing flexibility with our customers  available to our suppliers 
we cannot as immediately as our suppliers pass along the price increases to our national retailers and distributors 
as of december  and through the date hereof  we did not and do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  nor do we have any other present commitment that is likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
in addition  except for our need for additional capital to finance inventory purchases  we know of no trend  additional demand  event or uncertainty that will result in  or that is reasonably likely to result in  our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
results of operations net sales decreased to million dollars from million dollars  a decrease of thousand dollars or 
the decrease in net sales was reflective of the overall slowdown of the economy  the tightening of credit markets for the financing of new used boats and the historically high prices of fuel which directly affects recreational boat usage 
considering these factors the company has made inroads in expanding distribution to new customers in both the boating and automotive markets 
in the company also increased its sales of startron r to both the automotive as well as the power sports markets 
cost of sales and gross margins for the year  gross profit decreased approximately million dollars or  from approximately million dollars in  to approximately million dollars in gross margin percentages also decreased from approximately to  a change of approximately 
this was a result of the unprecedented increase in oil prices and the resulting increase in the company s raw material costs that could not be fully passed on to our customers 
in addition the company had a higher sales mix of lower margin antifreeze products in compared to prior year 
in we will continue management s initiatives to decrease raw material costs 
operating expenses for the year  total operating expenses aggregated approximately million dollars  a decrease of approximately thousand dollars from as a percentage of net sales operating expenses decreased from to 
advertising promotion decreased thousand dollars 
reduced cost of advertising  and placement in trade magazines reduced controllable advertising expenses 
marketing has pursued initiatives to promote and advertise startron starbrite products in both the tv media as well as target advertising in specific industry magazines 
selling  general administrative expenses remained flat between the two years 
the company reduced its non cash compensation expense for stock awards which was offset by higher operating expenses 
interest expense decreased approximately thousand dollars to thousand in  compared to thousand in this principally resulted from lower interest rates in operating profit operating profits decreased to approximately thousand dollars in from an operating profit of approximately thousand in  a decrease of thousand dollars or 
income taxes the company fully utilized its net operating losses nol s in as a result the company had a tax expense of thousand dollars in net income decreased to approximately thousand dollars in  from a net income of approximately thousand in a decrease of thousand dollars
