item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview we are in our development stage and therefore have had limited operations 
we build  own and operate coal gasification plants that utilize our proprietary u gas fluidized bed gasification technology to convert low rank coal and coal wastes into higher value energy products 
we believe that we have several advantages over commercially available competing gasification technologies  such as entrained flow and fixed bed  including our ability to use all ranks of coals including low rank  high ash and high moisture coals  which are significantly cheaper than higher grade coals  many coal waste products and biomass feed stocks  which provide greater fuel flexibility  and our ability to operate efficiently on a smaller scale  which enables us to construct plants at a lower capital cost thus enabling us to be a lower cost producer of syngas for energy products 
our principal business activities are currently focused in china 
our first commercial scale coal gasification plant is located in shandong province  china and has been in operation since the three months ended march  we have additional projects in various stages of development in henan province  china and in the inner mongolia autonomous region of china 
during the year ended june   we also investigated opportunities in mississippi and north dakota with north american coal  or nac 
however  based on current commodity prices and current financial market conditions in the us  we do not expect projects in the us will be a viable development option for us in the near term 
our gasification plants can produce synthesis gas  or syngas  a mixture of hydrogen  carbon monoxide and other products 
depending on local market need and fuel sources  syngas can in turn be used to produce many products including methanol  dimethyl ether  or dme  glycol  synthetic natural gas  or sng  ammonia  synthetic gasoline  steam  power and other byproducts eg  sulphur  carbon dioxide or ash 
our business strategy includes the following elements improve the profitability and cash flows of the hh joint venture plant 
we are in the process of implementing operational measures and evaluating strategies to reduce the hh joint venture s losses and improve its financial performance  including the possible expansion of the plant to produce other products and through the sharing of certain costs with hai hua 
execute on projects in china currently under development 
we intend to leverage our success to date at the hh joint venture in our ongoing business development efforts 
our projects under development are also expected to have a significant impact on our business development efforts and financial results once they are completed and producing 
we also believe that our yima joint venture will help to demonstrate our ability to expand into increasingly larger projects and new product markets 
managing further project development in china based on available capital 
based on our current focus on developing our projects in china  we plan to use our available cash for i general and administrative expenses  ii project and technical development expenses  iii debt service related to the hh joint venture  and iv working capital and general corporate purposes 
however  we intend to minimize any further development on projects or move ahead on any acquisitions until we have assurances that acceptable financing is available to complete the project 
until the capital markets improve  our strategy will be to operate using our current capital resources 

table of contents leverage our proprietary technology 
we intend to place increased focus on development of licensing arrangements for our proprietary u gas technology on a global basis with a focus on china  india  the us and australia due to their large low rank coal resources 
we anticipate that we can generate revenues through licensing fees and royalties on products sold by our licensees that incorporate our proprietary technology without incurring the significant capital costs required to develop a plant 
investigate acquisition opportunities 
if we have the capital or financing is otherwise available  we plan to evaluate acquisition opportunities  including existing plants  facilities or coal mines  where we could enhance the economics with our u gas technology 
expand our relationships with our strong strategic partners and new products 
china is presently our primary market  where our efforts have been focused primarily on facilities producing syngas  methanol and dme 
we plan to expand our relationships with our current partners  develop new relationships with strategic partners and develop new downstream coal to chemicals and coal to energy products 
continue to develop and improve u gas technology 
we are continually seeking to improve the overall plant availability  plant efficiency rates and fuel handling capabilities of the existing u gas gasification technology 
to date  we have filed eight patent applications relating to improvements to the u gas technology 
concentrate our efforts on opportunities where our u gas technology provides us with a clear competitive advantage 
we believe that we have the greatest competitive advantage using our u gas technology in situations where there is a ready source of low rank  low cost coal  coal waste or biomass to utilize as fuel 
results of operations we are in our development stage and therefore have had limited operations 
we have sustained net losses of approximately million from november   the date of our inception  to june  we have primarily financed our operations to date through private placements and two public offerings of our common stock 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue 
product sales increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were derived from the sale of syngas and byproducts produced at the hh joint venture plant 
the plant s initial syngas sales commenced during the three months ended march  product sales of million were recognized during the three months ended june  as the plant operated for approximately of the period and was available for production for approximately of the period 
although the plant declared commercial operations in december  hai hua did not begin paying the hh joint venture for the energy and capacity fees until may due to differing interpretations between hai hua and the hh joint venture regarding certain syngas quality components requirements under the contract 
during the three months ended march   the plant was only operating for approximately of the period due to an unscheduled maintenance outage  repairs related to a power outage  a local area government industrial inspection  and scheduled maintenance by hai hua 
project development fees were million for the year ended june  and were earned upon completion of the otter creek project pre feasibility study for nac 
cost of sales and plant operating expenses 
cost of sales and plant operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were comprised principally of coal consumption  electricity  maintenance and other operating costs at the hh joint venture plant 
the plant s initial operations commenced during the three months ended march  costs were higher during the year ended june  due to the plant operating for a longer period of time and due to costs incurred to enable the plant to declare commercial operations status in december general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee compensation as a result of increased staffing levels during the first half of fiscal  professional fees  travel and other expenses 
during the second half of fiscal  we made significant workforce and other cost reductions which reduced general and administrative expenses by as compared to the first half of fiscal general and administrative expenses included our internal project development and engineering staffing costs which have supported development of our yima project and other projects 

table of contents project and technical development expenses 
project and technical development expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the period included a million impairment loss on a royalty deposit paid to exxonmobil during the three months ended december  and a non cash charge to write off the million remaining carrying value of the reservation and use fee paid to gti 
the gti reservation and use fee was paid for with shares of our common stock during fiscal to reserve the facility for calendar and based on current commodity prices and current financial market conditions in the us  we have not utilized  and do not anticipate utilizing  gti s facility during calendar year excluding the effect of these charges  project and technical development expenses decreased by approximately million due primarily to a reduction in u 
s project and technical development activities and a million reimbursement from consol in full settlement of its cost sharing arrangement under our joint development agreement with consol 
project and technical development expenses incurred during the period related principally to the yima project  the feasibility study with nac for the development of a coal based gasification facility at nac s proposed otter creek mine in north dakota which has been suspended and our project with consol  which will not continue due to the expiration of the joint development agreement 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  for the year ended june   stock based compensation expense included a reduction of approximately million due to the reversal of previously recognized expense due to forfeitures related to cancellations of terminated employees stock option awards 
this decrease was offset  in part  with incremental compensation cost related to modifications resulting from the stock option exchange program and additional stock option awards granted during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due principally to commencing depreciation of the hh joint venture plant during the quarter ended march  interest income 
interest income increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to interest income from higher cash balances due to investment of the proceeds from an equity offering completed in june the yields earned on our investments have decreased significantly over fiscal due to market conditions 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  prior to the commissioning of the hh joint venture plant in january  the interest expense for the hh joint venture loan was capitalized 
minority interest 
minority interest increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due to recognizing our joint venture partners interests in the operating losses of the gc joint venture and the hh joint venture during the period 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue 
we had million in revenue during the year ended june  and none during the year ended june  revenue during the year ended june  was comprised of million of syngas sales produced at the hh joint venture plant in china and million of revenue from project development fees 
cost of sales and plant operating expenses 
there were million of costs of sales and plant operating expenses the year ended june  and none during the year ended june  cost of sales and plant operating expenses during the year ended june  were comprised principally of coal consumption  electricity  maintenance and other operating costs at the hh joint venture plant 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and incentive wages as a result of increased staffing levels  and to a lesser extent  an increase in travel expenses associated with activities in china  investor relations expenses  outside consulting and accounting fees incurred in connection with sarbanes oxley act compliance requirements and legal fees 
project and technical development expenses 
project and technical development expenses increased by million to million during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  due to expenditures related to our projects with consol  hai hua and golden concord and the amortization of million of the gti facility reservation and use fee for calendar year 
table of contents stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million to million during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  the decrease was due to the partial immediate vesting of options granted to certain members of senior management in prior periods 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due principally to commencing depreciation of the hh joint venture plant during the quarter ended march  interest income 
interest income decreased by million to million during the year ended june  from million during the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates partially offset by higher interest income from higher cash balances due to investment of the proceeds from equity offerings during the year 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended june  and none for the year ended june  prior to the hh joint venture plant being placed into service  interest expense related to the hh joint venture s outstanding loan with the industrial and commercial bank of china  or icbc  was capitalized 
the hai hua plant was commissioned in january interest on the icbc loan has been expensed from that point forward 
minority interest 
minority interest increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  the increase was due to recognizing our joint venture partners interests in the operating losses of the gc joint venture and the hh joint venture during the period 
liquidity and capital resources we are in our development stage and have financed our operations to date through private placements of our common stock in and and two public offerings  one in november and one in june we have used the proceeds of these offerings for the development of our joint ventures in china and to pay other development and general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we have entered into a loan agreement with icbc to fund certain of the costs of the hh joint venture 
as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital available to us 
during the year ended june   cash flows used in operating activities were million 
in august  we invested million of our cash into the yima joint ventures 
at current levels  we expect to incur general and administrative expenses of approximately to million during fiscal we are also funding the working capital  operating losses and debt service of the hh joint venture 
the following summarizes the uses of equity capital and debt with respect to our projects 
hh joint venture our first project is the hh joint venture  through which we and hai hua developed  constructed and are now operating a syngas production plant utilizing u gas technology in zaozhuang city  shandong province  china designed to produce approximately  standard cubic meters per hour of gross syngas 
the plant produces and sells syngas and the various byproducts of the plant  including ash and elemental sulphur 
hai hua  an independent producer of coke and coke oven gas  owns a subsidiary engaged in methanol production 
we have contributed million in equity capital and hai hua has contributed million in equity capital 
the plant produced initial syngas and syngas sales commenced during the three months ended march  the plant was built on a site adjacent to the hai hua coke and methanol facility 
hai hua has granted rights of way for construction access and other ongoing operations of the plant 
the land for the construction of this plant was acquired from the chinese government with the assistance of the shandong xue cheng economic development zone 
for the first years after the date that the plant became operational  of all net profits of the hh joint venture will be distributed to us 
after the initial twenty years  the profit distribution percentages will be changed  with us receiving of the net profits of the hh joint venture and hai hua receiving 
the contract has a term of years  subject to earlier termination if the hh joint venture either files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent or if the syngas purchase contract between the hh joint venture and hai hua discussed in more detail below is terminated 
hai hua has also agreed that the license agreement is our sole property and that it will not compete with us with respect to fluidized bed gasification technology for the term of the hh joint venture 
the hh joint venture plant operated at limited capacity for a significant part of fiscal and is expected to continue operating at reduced capacity due to the depressed methanol market 
the reduced capacity at the hh joint venture plant has contributed to the plant s operating losses 
in addition to funding these operating losses  we are funding the working capital and debt service for the hh joint venture 
we are in the process of implementing operational measures  pursuing additional customers and evaluating strategies to reduce the hh joint venture s losses and improve its financial performance including the possible expansion of the plant to produce other products 
if an expansion of the hh joint venture plant were to be developed  we would expect to contribute our interest in the hh joint venture to the project without significant additional cash investment by us 
if we are not successful in improving the hh joint venture s profitability  or if management s estimated cash flow projections for these assets significantly decrease  or if hai hua does not make its required payments  the plant s assets could be impaired 
as of june   we estimated projected cash flows for the plant and based on this we have determined that these assets were not impaired 

table of contents on march   the hh joint venture entered into a seven year loan agreement and received million of loan proceeds pursuant to the terms of a fixed asset loan contract with icbc to complete the project financing for the hh joint venture 
key terms of the fixed asset loan contract with icbc are as follows term of the loan is seven years from the commencement date march  of the loan  interest is adjusted annually based upon the standard rate announced each year by the people s bank of china 
as of june   the applicable interest rate was and is payable monthly  principal payments of million are due in march and september of each year beginning on september  and ending on march   hai hua is the guarantor of the entire loan  assets of the hh joint venture are pledged as collateral for the loan  covenants include  among other things  prohibiting pre payment without the consent of icbc and permiting icbc to be involved in the review and inspection of the hai hua plant  and loan is subject to customary events of default which  should one or more of them occur and be continuing  would permit icbc to declare all amounts owing under the contract to be due and payable immediately 
as of june   the hh joint venture is in compliance with all covenants and obligations under the fixed asset loan contract 
the plant produced initial syngas  and syngas sales commenced  during the three months ended march  due to recent worldwide reductions in methanol prices  hai hua is operating at a reduced rate of syngas consumption 
hai hua is forecasting the use of approximately to of the syngas guarantee capacity for the remainder of calendar although the plant declared commercial operations in december  hai hua did not begin paying the hh joint venture for the energy and capacity fees until may due to differing interpretations between hai hua and the hh joint venture regarding certain syngas quality components requirements under the contract 
during the three months ended march   the plant was only operating for approximately of the period 
the downtime was due to an unscheduled maintenance outage  repairs related to a power outage  a local area government industrial inspection  and scheduled maintenance by hai hua 
during the three months ended june   the plant operated for approximately of the period  was available for production for approximately of the period  and met hai hua s syngas demand and quality requirements for approximately of the time it was operating 
based on these events  in april  the hh joint venture entered into the supplementary agreement with hai hua  amending the terms of the purchase and sales contract 
the supplementary agreement was entered into to provide more clarity regarding the required syngas quality and volume to be delivered  recovery of the energy fee during turndown periods and operations coordination during unscheduled outages 
under the supplementary agreement  the syngas quality specification has been amended to provide more clarity as to the minor constituents allowable in the syngas 
for purposes of the contract  syngas that meets these specifications is deemed compliant gas and syngas that does not meet these specifications is deemed non compliant gas 
the supplementary agreement also adds a requirement for hai hua to pay the hh joint venture the capacity fee and of the energy fee for all non compliant gas which is taken by hai hua 
however  if more than of the syngas taken by hai hua during any operating day is non compliant gas  all of the syngas for that day is deemed to be non compliant gas for purposes of calculating the energy fee 
in addition  the supplementary agreement accommodates periods of turndown operation by hai hua by establishing a minimum threshold gas off take volume of  ncum per hour of net syngas for the purpose of calculating the energy fee during such periods 
the supplementary agreement also provides that  to the extent hai hua has an unscheduled shutdown  and the plant continues to operate on standby during such period  hai hua is still required to pay the energy fee to the hh joint venture 
in the event that the plant has an unscheduled shutdown and does not provide at least three hours prior notice to hai hua  the hh joint venture may be required to provide certain compensation to hai hua 

table of contents in an effort to reduce operating costs  the hh joint venture entered into an additional agreement with hai hua in may whereby the cost of operating the plant s air separation unit  or asu  can be shared between the two parties based on the oxygen consumption of the respective parties over the relevant period 
the hh joint venture began to provide oxygen and nitrogen to hai hua in september this cost sharing arrangement is expected to reduce operating costs of both the hh joint venture and hai hua by allowing the parties to operate only one asu instead of both parties operating their respective asu s at low capacity 
yima joint ventures in august  we entered into amended joint venture contracts with yima  replacing the prior joint venture contracts entered into in october and april the yima joint ventures were formed for each of the gasification  methanol methanol protein production  and utility island components of the plant 
we obtained government approvals for the project s feasibility study during the three months ended december  and for the project s environmental impact assessment during the three months ended march   which were the two key approvals required to proceed with the project 
the amended joint venture contracts provide that i we and yima contribute equity of and  respectively  to the yima joint ventures  ii if debt financing is not available to the project  yima is obligated to provide debt financing via shareholder loans to the project until the project is able to secure third party debt financing  and iii yima will supply coal to the project from a mine located in close proximity to the project at a preferential price subject to a definitive agreement to be subsequently negotiated 
as a result of these provisions  we and yima have contributed our remaining equity contributions of million and million  respectively  to the yima joint ventures 
in the first fiscal quarter of  we will incur a charge of million relating to consulting fees paid in connection with the closing and funding of the yima project 
in exchange for our capital contributions  we own a interest in each joint venture and yima owns a interest 
notwithstanding this  in connection with an expansion of the project  we have the option to contribute a greater percentage of capital for the expansion  such that as a result  we would have up to a ownership interest in the yima joint ventures 
when phase one of the project is completed  the plant is expected to have an annual capacity of  tonnes per annum of refined methanol 
the parties are planning two future phases of coal gasification projects at this location 
phase two is expected to add additional capacity of  tonnes per annum of refined methanol or methanol equivalent products  and phase three is expected to add additional capacity of  tonnes per annum of refined methanol or methanol equivalent products 
refined methanol is the main feedstock for methanol protein and the approvals to date have related to methanol protein production which has not yet been proven to be a commercially viable technology 
we intend to sell methanol as the primary product from the project and sell methanol protein from a small scale demonstration unit in the project 
we intend to obtain the business license and related permits for both methanol and methanol protein production 
there may be delays in the project if we are unable to obtain these permits 
the joint venture companies have been established 
construction activities for site preparation are currently underway and a chinese design institute has been selected for the project s engineering work 
the remaining construction and commissioning of phase one is expected to take approximately three years 
based on the project s current scope  the parties current estimate of the total required capital of phase one of the project  which includes the downstream facilities and infrastructure investment in support of phase two of the plant  is approximately million 
the total investment for phase two is expected to be significantly lower 
under the revised joint venture contracts  yima has agreed to supply coal to the project at a preferential price subject to a definitive agreement to be subsequently negotiated 
additionally  we and the yima joint ventures are continuing to investigate the possible acquisition of an operating coal mine which would provide coal to the project 
the remaining capital for the project is to be provided by project debt to be obtained by the yima joint ventures 
yima has agreed to guarantee the project debt and we expect this guarantee will allow debt financing to be obtained from domestic chinese banking sources 
in the event that the debt financing is not obtained  yima has agreed to provide a loan to the joint ventures to satisfy the remaining capital needs of the project with terms comparable to current market rates at the time of the loan 
yima s loan would be repaid as soon as third party debt financing is available for the project 
we have agreed to pledge to yima our ownership interests in the joint ventures as security for our obligations under any project guarantee or loan provided by yima 
the yima joint ventures will be governed by a board of directors consisting of eight directors  two of whom will be appointed by us and six of whom will be appointed by yima 
the joint ventures will also have officers that are appointed by us  yima and or the board of directors pursuant to the terms of the joint venture contracts 
we and yima shall share the profits  and bear the risks and losses  of the joint ventures in proportion to our respective ownership interests 
the term of the joint venture shall commence upon each joint venture company obtaining its business license and shall end years after the issuance of such business licenses 

table of contents golden concord joint venture our joint venture with golden concord was formed to i develop  construct and operate a coal gasification  methanol and dme production plant utilizing u gas technology in the xilinguole economic and technology development zone  inner mongolia autonomous region  china and ii produce and sell methanol  dme and the various byproducts of the plant  including fly ash  steam  sulphur  hydrogen  xenon and argon 
we agreed to contribute approximately million in cash in exchange for a ownership interest in the gc joint venture  and golden concord has agreed to contribute approximately million in cash for a ownership interest in the gc joint venture 
we consolidate the results of the gc joint venture in our consolidated financial statements 
as of june   we have funded a total of million of our equity contribution and golden concord has funded an additional approximately million of its equity contribution 
in the near term  we anticipate additional funding to the gc joint venture of approximately million to settle outstanding design and construction related vendor payments 
we do not anticipate funding any further equity contributions to the gc joint venture until acceptable financing can be obtained for the project 
we believe that  given existing market conditions  debt financing is not currently available on terms that are economically acceptable 
however  we are continuing to evaluate alternatives for financing with potential partners 
we are maintaining some of our on site staff and related functions and are closely monitoring the relevant credit markets 
because of these factors  we do not believe that the assets of the gc joint venture were impaired as of june  if we are unable to develop alternatives for financing with potential partners  the assets of the gc joint venture may be deemed impaired 
in december  the gc joint venture purchased year land use rights from the chinese government for the construction of the plant 
the million cost to purchase these land use rights has been capitalized on our balance sheet as a long term asset which is being amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease 
us department of energy the national energy technology laboratory of the us department of energy  or the doe  is co funding a series of studies to develop industrial coal fueled hybrid gasification units 
the effort would focus on a large industrial sized coal stabilized gasification unit 
it is expected that the unit would produce pressurized syngas intended for the production of about  gallons per week of fischer tropsch liquids  and produce power 
we have been contracted by a us engineering company to supply a conceptual design report for the gasification system portion of the hybrid gasification system 
we believe that our experience in gasification equipment similar to that needed by the hybrid gasification system envisioned by the doe makes us well positioned to supply the gasifier 
gti pursuant to the terms and conditions of the license agreement  we were required to i have a contract for the sale of a u gas system with a customer in the territory covered by the license agreement no later than august  and ii fabricate and put into operation at least one u gas system by july  we have a continuing obligation to fabricate and put into operation at least one u gas system for each calendar year of the license agreement  beginning with the calendar year we satisfied the obligation to have a contract for the sale of a u gas system no later than august  and fabricate and put into operation at least one u gas system by july  through our hh joint venture project 
in june  we agreed to pay gti a non refundable payment of million toward future royalties due to gti for the proposed yima joint ventures project 
in conjunction with this agreement  gti agreed to waive our next required obligation to put a u gas system into operation until the earlier of the renegotiated license agreement or december  additionally  we are required to disclose to gti any improvements related to the u gas system that are developed and implemented by us and the manner of using and applying such improvements 
failure to satisfy the requirements as to these milestones could lead to the revocation of the license by gti  provided  however  that gti is required to give a twelve month notice of termination and we are able to cure the default and continue the license agreement prior to the expiration of such time period 
outlook we expect to continue to have negative cash flows until we can generate sufficient revenues from the hh joint venture and other projects and licenses under development  including yima  to cover our general and administrative expenses and other operating costs 
we currently plan to use our available cash for i our general and administrative expenses  ii working capital  iii debt service related to the hh joint venture  iv project and technical development expenses  and v general corporate purposes 
the actual allocation of and the timing of the expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including changes in our strategic relationships  commodity prices and industry conditions  and other factors that we cannot currently predict 
in particular  the global economy has experienced a significant contraction  with an almost unprecedented lack of availability of business and consumer credit  which has impeded our ability to obtain financing for our projects 
this decrease and any future decrease in economic activity in china or in other regions of the world in which we may in the future do business could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in a number of other ways 
in addition  the market for commodities such as methanol is under significant pressure and we are unsure of how much longer this will continue 
as a direct result of these trends  our ability to finance and develop our existing projects  commence any new projects and sell our products could be adversely impacted 
we believe that improving the financial performance and reducing the operating costs of the hh joint venture plant are critical to improving our financial performance and we believe this can be accomplished through the expansion of the plant and the sale of our excess oxygen capacity to hai hua 
currently  we do not believe any additional equity contributions by us would be required for an expansion  as we expect to contribute a portion of our equity stake in the existing joint venture toward the expansion 
the scope of the expansion is still under evaluation and we expect to make a decision on moving forward during the first half of calendar year the hh joint venture began to provide oxygen and nitrogen to hai hua in september under a cost sharing arrangement that we believe will reduce our operating costs in the near term 

table of contents we are also actively pursuing project partners to invest in our projects development including for the gc joint venture and for the possible expansion of the hh joint venture plant 
in addition  we have a variety of cooperation agreements in place with regional governments  coal companies and downstream off takers for potential projects in china that would utilize u gas as a platform for products such as sng  chemicals such as glycol  and fuels such as methanol and dme 
as discussed in business target markets china  the chinese government has approved new standards for methanol to be used in methanol blended with gasoline  and although these standards do not mandate the use of methanol  we believe this is a positive development for the long term outlook of methanol demand 
as these projects develop  they may include combinations of equity and debt financing from third parties  selective equity investments by us  retention of a carried interest by us  or technology licenses 
we are also considering possible scenarios for u gas licensing allowing us to build on our experience at the hh joint venture and our technology and engineering capability 
we believe that we may generate revenues through licensing fees and royalties without incurring all of the capital costs required to develop a project 
however  we cannot predict the timing of  or revenues to be generated by  any such licensing opportunity 
our development of any further projects will be limited until worldwide capital and debt markets improve and we have assurances that acceptable financing is available to complete the project 
until these markets improve  our strategy will be to operate in china using our current capital resources 
even if we do obtain the necessary capital for our projects  we could face other delays in our projects due to additional approval requirements or due to unanticipated issues in the commissioning of such a project 
these factors could lead to  among other things  the impairment of several of our significant assets  including our investments in the hh joint venture  the gc joint venture and the yima joint ventures  and an inability to develop any further projects 
we will need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financing for any new projects that are developed  to support our existing projects and possible expansions thereof and for our corporate general and administrative expenses 
we cannot assure that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
any such financing could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things  i maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels  ii negotiate and enter into new gasification plant development contracts  iii expand our operations  iv hire and train new employees  or v respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions which are inherently imprecise and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies due to the significance  subjectivity and judgment involved in determining our estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis utilizing historic experience  anticipated future events or trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the resulting effects of changes in our estimates are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the change in estimate become known 
we believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements impairment evaluation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  construction in progress  equity method investments and specifically identified intangibles  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we are required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with a long lived asset or group of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for long lived assets that are expected to be held and used 
we evaluate our operating plants as a whole 
production equipment at each plant is not evaluated for impairment separately  as it is integral to the assumed future operations of the plant 
all construction and development projects are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of potential reduction in fair value 
if it is determined that it is no longer probable that the projects will be completed and all capitalized costs recovered through future operations  the carrying values of the projects would be written down to the recoverable value 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment charge 

table of contents the following summarizes some of the most significant estimates and assumptions used in evaluating if we have an impairment charge 
undiscounted expected future cash flows 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our other earnings forecasts 
the use of this method involves inherent uncertainty 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
fair value 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
we will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment 
we may also consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations  however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments for equity method investments such as our equity investment in the yima joint ventures involve the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that we own directly 
similarly  our estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subjective  and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material 
hh joint venture plant impairment analysis we assessed the hh joint venture s plant assets for impairment as of june  due to its operating at reduced capacity and its operating losses to date 
significant assumptions we made in determination of the projected cash flows for purposes of this impairment analysis included the plant s availability for production of compliant syngas and expected cost reductions from the sharing of our asu costs with hai hua 
variances in these assumptions could result in projected cash flows that do not support the assets carrying values 
for example  if the plant s availability to produce compliant syngas was reduced from to  or if the assumed cost reductions from the asu cost sharing arrangement with hai hua were less  the projected cash flows would have been less than the assets carrying values resulting in an impairment of the assets 
the hh joint venture plant operated at limited capacity for a significant part of fiscal and is expected to continue operating at reduced capacity due to the depressed methanol market 
the reduced capacity at the hh joint venture plant has contributed to the plant s operating losses 
in addition to funding these operating losses  we are funding the working capital and debt service for the hh joint venture 
we are in the process of implementing operational measures  pursuing additional customers and evaluating strategies to reduce the hh joint venture s losses and improve its financial performance including the possible expansion of the plant to produce other products 
if an expansion of the hh joint venture plant were to be developed  we would expect to contribute our interest in the hh joint venture to the project without significant additional cash investment by us 
if we are not successful in improving the hh joint venture s profitability  or if management s estimated cash flow projections for these assets significantly decrease  or if hai hua does not make its required payments  the plant s assets could be impaired 
as of june   we have determined that these assets were not impaired 
accounting for variable interest entities vies and financial statement consolidation criteria the joint ventures which we enter into may be considered vies 
we consolidate all vies where we are the primary beneficiary 
this determination is made at the inception of our involvement with the vie 
we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors and form a conclusion that we  or another interest holder  absorb a majority of the entity s risk for expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s potential for expected residual returns  or both 
we do not consolidate vies where we are not the primary beneficiary 
we account for these unconsolidated vies under the equity method of accounting and include our net investment in investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
our equity interest in the net income or loss from our unconsolidated vies is recorded in non operating income expense on a net basis on our consolidated statement of operations 
we have determined that the hh joint venture is a vie and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary 
in making that determination  we considered  among other items  the change in profit distribution between us and hai hua after years 
the expected negative variability in the fair value of the hh joint venture s net assets was considered to be greater during the first years of the hh joint venture s life  which coincides with our profit loss allocation  versus the latter years in which our profit loss allocation is reduced to 
in addition  we considered whether the terms of the syngas purchase and sale agreement with hai hua contained a lease 
the factors considered included i our ability to operate and control the plant during the initial years  and ii whether it was more than remote that one or more parties other than hai hua would purchase more than a minor amount considered to be of the plant s output during the term of the syngas purchase and sale agreement 
because we determined that the syngas purchase and sale agreement did not contain a lease  we account for the revenues from this agreement in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for product sales 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in january  we entered into a month lease agreement  with a month optional renewal  for our corporate offices in houston  texas 
the lease commenced on march  with rental payments of  per month for the first year and escalating thereafter annually 
our obligations under the lease are secured by a letter of credit for  which is payable to the landlord in the event of any uncured default by us under the lease 
the letter of credit remains in place until the third anniversary of the lease  but is reduced to  after the second anniversary of the lease 
we have a certificate of deposit pledged as collateral for this letter of credit and pay an annual fee of on this letter of credit 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations at june  were as follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term bank loan  including interest operating leases total recently issued accounting standards effective july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 fair value measurements as it relates to financial assets and financial liabilities 
in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which defers the effective date of sfas no 
by a year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
accordingly  we deferred the adoption of sfas no 
for its nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until july  the adoption of sfas no 
is not currently expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment to arb no 
sfas no 
requires non controlling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity 
additionally  we will be required to present net income attributable to us and the minority partners ownership interest separately on the consolidated statements of operations 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and we adopted this standard as of july  sfas no 
will be applied prospectively to all non controlling interests  including any that arose before the effective date 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events 
sfas no 
establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued 
sfas no 
sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date and the disclosures an entity should make about such events or transactions 
sfas no 
is applicable to both interim and annual financial statements ending after june  management has performed a review of our subsequent events and transactions through september   which is the date the financial statements are issued 
in april  fasb issued fsp no 
fas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
fsp no 
fas and apb amends fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  as well as apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements 
fsp no 
fas and apb is effective for interim periods ending after june   therefore we will adopt this standard as of september  adoption of this standard is expected to result in the addition of interim disclosures of the fair values of our financial instruments  which previously had only been required annually 
adoption of this standard is expected to have no effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
sfas no 
changes the consolidation analysis for variable interest entities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  we are currently evaluating this standard but have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
establishes the fasb accounting standards codification codification  which officially commenced july   to become the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commision under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for registrants 
the subsequent issuances of new standards will be in the form of accounting standards updates that will be included in the codification 
generally  the codification is not expected to change us gaap 
all other accounting literature excluded from the codification will be considered nonauthoritative 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september   therefore we will adopt sfas no 
for our quarter ending september  we are currently evaluating the effect on our financial statement disclosures as all future references to authoritative accounting literature will be referenced in accordance with the codification 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these risks through regular operating and financing activities  and may  in the future  use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to date 
foreign currency risk we conduct operations in china and the functional currency in china is the renminbi yuan 
our financial statements are expressed in us dollars and will be negatively affected if foreign currencies  such as the renminbi yuan  depreciate relative to the us dollar 
in addition  our currency exchange losses may be magnified by exchange control regulations in china or other countries that restrict our ability to convert into us dollars 
commodity price risk our business plan is to purchase coal and other consumables from suppliers and to sell commodities  such as syngas  methanol and other products 
coal is the largest component of our costs of sales and in order to mitigate coal price fluctuation risk for future projects  we expect to enter into long term contracts for coal supply or to acquire coal assets 
for the sale of commodities from our projects  fixed price contracts will not be available to us in certain markets  such as china  which will require us to purchase some portion of our coal and other consumable needs  or sell some portion of our production  into spot commodity markets or under short term supply agreements 
hedging transactions may be available to reduce our exposure to these commodity price risks  but availability may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge this exposure at all 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions 
customer credit risk when our projects progress to commercial production  we will be exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
to manage customer credit risk  we intend to monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
as of june   hai hua is our only customer for syngas sales and as such  we are exposed to significant customer credit risk due to this concentration 
unless we are able to retain our customers  or secure new customers if we lose one or more of our significant customers  our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected
