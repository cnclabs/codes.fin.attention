however  fusion cannot purchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to the purchase agreement if the price of our common stock has three trading days with an average value below over the prior twelve trading days 
for the past few months  with limited exceptions  the price of our common stock has been below  thereby adversely affecting our ability to exercise the fusion financing 
assuming no material financing from the sale of securities to fusion  financing under the standby financing agreement is not sufficient and if we are unable to commercialize and sell ampligen r and or increase sales of alferon n injection r or our other products  we will need to secure other sources of funding through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to satisfy our working capital needs and to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen r products 
in this regard we previously registered  worth of our securities in a universal shelf registration statement  none of which has been designated or issued 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products or continue our operations 
our alferon n injection r commercial sales have halted due to lack of finished goods inventory 
our finished goods inventory of alferon n injection r reached it s expiration date in march as a result  we have no product to sell at this time 
the fda has declined to respond to our requests for an extension of the expiration date  therefore we consider the request to be denied 
since our testing of the product indicates that it is not impaired and could be safely utilized  the finished goods inventory of  alferon n injection r ml vials may be used to produce approximately  sachets of low dose oral alferon ldo for future clinical trials 
production of alferon n injection r from our work in progress inventory  which has an approximate expiration date of  has been put on hold at this time due to the resources needed to prepare our new brunswick facility for the fda preapproval inspection with respect to our ampligen r nda 
work on the alferon n injection r is expected to resume in mid under the condition that adequate funding is obtained  which means that we may not have any alferon n injection r product commercially available until in  we averaged alferon n injection r sales of approximately  per month 
however with no fda approval to extend the expiration date of our finished good inventory  we will no longer receive these monthly revenues 
in addition  if there is a significant absence of the product from the market place  no assurance can be given that sales will return to prior levels 
although preliminary in vitro testing indicates that ampligen r enhances the effectiveness of different drug combinations on avian influenza  preliminary testing in the laboratory is not necessarily predictive of successful results in clinical testing or human treatment 
ampligen r continues to undergo pre clinical testing for possible treatment of avian flu 
although preliminary in vitro testing indicates that ampligen r enhances the effectiveness of different drug combinations on avian flu  preliminary testing in the laboratory is not necessarily predictive of successful results in clinical testing or human treatment 
no assurance can be given that similar results will be observed in clinical trials 
use of ampligen r in the treatment of avian flu requires prior regulatory approval 
only the fda can determine whether a drug is safe  effective or promising for treating a specific application 
as discussed in the prior risk factor  obtaining regulatory approvals is a rigorous and lengthy process 
in addition  ampligen r is currently being tested on strains of avian influenza virus 
there are a number of strains and strains mutate 
no assurance can be given that ampligen r will be effective on any strains that might infect humans 
we may not be profitable unless we can protect our patents and or receive approval for additional pending patents 
we need to preserve and acquire enforceable patents covering the use of ampligen r for a particular disease in order to obtain exclusive rights for the commercial sale of ampligen r for such disease 
we obtained all rights to alferon n injection r  and we plan to preserve and acquire enforceable patents covering its use for existing and potentially new diseases 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to preserve and obtain patent protection for our products and to obtain and preserve our trade secrets and expertise 
certain of our know how and technology is not patentable  particularly the procedures for the manufacture of our experimental drug  ampligen r  which is carried out according to standard operating procedure manuals 
we also have been issued patents on the use of ampligen r in combination with certain other drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus  chronic hepatitis c virus  and a patent which affords protection on the use of ampligen r in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome 
we have not yet been issued any patents in the united states for the use of ampligen r as a sole treatment for any of the cancers  which we have sought to target 
with regard to alferon n injection r  we have acquired from isi its patents for natural alpha interferon produced from human peripheral blood leukocytes and its production process and we have filed a patent application for the use of alferon r ldo in treating viral diseases including avian influenza 
we cannot assure that our competitors will not seek and obtain patents regarding the use of similar products in combination with various other agents  for a particular target indication prior to our doing such 
if we cannot protect our patents covering the use of our products for a particular disease  or obtain additional patents  we may not be able to successfully market our products 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of protection afforded by pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents 
there can be no assurance that new patent applications relating to our products or technology will result in patents being issued or that  if issued  such patents will afford meaningful protection against competitors with similar technology 
it is generally anticipated that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and intellectual property rights 
such litigation could require substantial resources from us and we may not have the financial resources necessary to enforce the patent rights that we hold 
no assurance can be made that our patents will provide competitive advantages for our products or will not be successfully challenged by competitors 
no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could not be filed which would have a materially adverse effect on our ability to develop or market our products or to obtain or maintain any competitive position that we may achieve with respect to our products 
our patents also may not prevent others from developing competitive products using related technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary licenses if we cannot enforce patent rights we may hold 
in addition  the failure of third parties from whom we currently license certain proprietary information or from whom we may be required to obtain such licenses in the future  to adequately enforce their rights to such proprietary information  could adversely affect the value of such licenses to us 
if we cannot enforce the patent rights we currently hold we may be required to obtain licenses from others to develop  manufacture or market our products 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we currently license certain proprietary information from third parties  some of which may have been developed with government grants under circumstances where the government maintained certain rights with respect to the proprietary information developed 
no assurances can be given that such third parties will adequately enforce any rights they may have or that the rights  if any  retained by the government will not adversely affect the value of our license 
there is no guarantee that our trade secrets will not be disclosed or known by our competitors 
to protect our rights  we require certain employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements with us 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate and enforceable remedies for any breach  or that any trade secrets of ours will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we have limited marketing and sales capability 
if we are unable to obtain additional distributors and our current and future distributors do not market our products successfully  we may not generate significant revenues or become profitable 
we have limited marketing and sales capability 
we are dependent upon existing and  possibly future  marketing agreements and third party distribution agreements for our products in order to generate significant revenues and become profitable 
as a result  any revenues received by us will be dependent in large part on the efforts of third parties  and there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
our commercialization strategy for ampligen r cfs may include licensing co marketing agreements utilizing the resources and capacities of a strategic partner s 
we are currently seeking worldwide marketing partner s  with the goal of having a relationship in place before approval is obtained 
in parallel to partnering discussions  appropriate pre marketing activities will be undertaken 
we intend to control manufacturing of ampligen on a world wide basis 
we cannot assure that our us or foreign marketing strategy will be successful or that we will be able to establish future marketing or third party distribution agreements on terms acceptable to us  or that the cost of establishing these arrangements will not exceed any product revenues 
our inability to establish viable marketing and sales capabilities would most likely have a materially adverse effect on us 
there are no long term agreements with suppliers of required materials 
if we are unable to obtain the required raw materials  we may be required to scale back our operations or stop manufacturing alferon n injection r and or ampligen r 
a number of essential materials are used in the production of alferon n injection r  including human white blood cells 
we do not have long term agreements for the supply of any of such materials 
there can be no assurance we can enter into long term supply agreements covering essential materials on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
there are a limited number of manufacturers in the united states available to provide the polymers for use in manufacturing ampligen r 
at present  we do not have any agreements with third parties for the supply of any of these polymers 
we have established relevant manufacturing operations within our new brunswick  new jersey facility for the production of ampligen r polymers from raw materials in order to obtain polymers on a more consistent manufacturing basis 
if we are unable to obtain or manufacture the required polymers  we may be required to scale back our operations or stop manufacturing 
the costs and availability of products and materials we need for the production of ampligen r and the commercial production of alferon n injection r and other products which we may commercially produce are subject to fluctuation depending on a variety of factors beyond our control  including competitive factors  changes in technology  and fda and other governmental regulations and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such products and materials on terms acceptable to us or at all 
there is no assurance that successful manufacture of a drug on a limited scale basis for investigational use will lead to a successful transition to commercial  large scale production 
small changes in methods of manufacturing  including commercial scale up  may affect the chemical structure of ampligen r and other rna drugs  as well as their safety and efficacy  and can  among other things  require new clinical studies and affect orphan drug status  particularly  market exclusivity rights  if any  under the orphan drug act 
the transition from limited production of pre clinical and clinical research quantities to production of commercial quantities of our products will involve distinct management and technical challenges and will require additional management and technical personnel and capital to the extent such manufacturing is not handled by third parties 
there can be no assurance that our manufacturing will be successful or that any given product will be determined to be safe and effective  capable of being manufactured economically in commercial quantities or successfully marketed 
we have limited manufacturing experience and capacity 
ampligen r has been only produced in limited quantities for use in our clinical trials and we are dependent upon a third party supplier for substantially all of the production process 
the failure to continue these arrangements or to achieve other such arrangements on satisfactory terms could have a material adverse affect on us 
also to be successful  our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at acceptable costs 
to the extent we are involved in the production process  our current facilities are not adequate for the production of our proposed products for large scale commercialization  and we currently do not have adequate personnel to conduct commercial scale manufacturing 
we intend to utilize third party facilities if and when the need arises or  if we are unable to do so  to build or acquire commercial scale manufacturing facilities 
we will need to comply with regulatory requirements for such facilities  including those of the fda pertaining to current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations 
there can be no assurance that such facilities can be used  built  or acquired on commercially acceptable terms  or that such facilities  if used  built  or acquired  will be adequate for our long term needs 
please refer to the risk factor our alferon n injection r commercial sales have halted due to lack of finished goods inventory 
we may not be profitable unless we can produce ampligen r or other products in commercial quantities at costs acceptable to us 
we have never produced ampligen r or any other products in large commercial quantities 
we must manufacture our products in compliance with regulatory requirements in large commercial quantities and at acceptable costs in order for us to be profitable 
we intend to utilize third party manufacturers and or facilities if and when the need arises or  if we are unable to do so  to build or acquire commercial scale manufacturing facilities 
if we cannot manufacture commercial quantities of ampligen r or enter into third party agreements for its manufacture at costs acceptable to us  our operations will be significantly affected 
also  each production lot of alferon n injection r is subject to fda review and approval prior to releasing the lots to be sold 
this review and approval process could take considerable time  which would delay our having product in inventory to sell 
rapid technological change may render our products obsolete or non competitive 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
technological competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase 
most of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than us  as well as substantial marketing  financial and managerial resources  and represent significant competition for us 
there can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive or that we will be able to keep pace with technological developments 
our products may be subject to substantial competition 
ampligen r 
competitors may be developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these potential products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects to products being developed by us 
these competing products may be more effective and less costly than our products 
in addition  conventional drug therapy  surgery and other more familiar treatments may offer competition to our products 
furthermore  many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than us in pre clinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and in obtaining fda  hpb and other regulatory approvals of products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda  hpb or other regulatory product approvals more rapidly than us 
there are no drugs approved for commercial sale with respect to treating me cfs in the united states 
the dominant competitors with drugs to treat disease indications in which we plan to address include gilead pharmaceutical  pfizer  bristol myers  abbott labs  glaxosmithkline  merck and schering plough corp 
these potential competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world  are well known to the public and the medical community  and have substantially greater financial resources  product development  and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
although we believe our principal advantage is the unique mechanism of action of ampligen r on the immune system  we cannot assure that we will be able to compete 
alferon n injection r 
our competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world  are well known to the public and the medical community  and have substantially greater financial resources  product development  and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
alferon n injection r currently competes with schering s injectable recombinant alpha interferon product intron r a for the treatment of genital warts 
m pharmaceuticals also offer competition from its immune response modifier  aldara r  a self administered topical cream  for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts 
in addition  medigene has fda approval for a self administered ointment  veregentm  which is indicated for the topical treatment of external genital and perianal warts 
alferon n injection r also competes with surgical  chemical  and other methods of treating genital warts 
we cannot assess the impact products developed by our competitors  or advances in other methods of the treatment of genital warts  will have on the commercial viability of alferon n injection r 
if and when we obtain additional approvals of uses of this product  we expect to compete primarily on the basis of product performance 
our competitors have developed or may develop products containing either alpha or beta interferon or other therapeutic compounds or other treatment modalities for those uses 
there can be no assurance that  if we are able to obtain regulatory approval of alferon n injection r for the treatment of new indications  we will be able to achieve any significant penetration into those markets 
in addition  because certain competitive products are not dependent on a source of human blood cells  such products may be able to be produced in greater volume and at a lower cost than alferon n injection r 
currently  our wholesale price on a per unit basis of alferon n injection r is higher than that of the competitive recombinant alpha and beta interferon products 
general 
other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than we do  obtaining approvals for such products from the fda more rapidly than we do  or developing products that are more effective than those we may develop 
while we will attempt to expand our technological capabilities in order to remain competitive  there can be no assurance that research and development by others or other medical advances will not render our technology or products obsolete or non competitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop 
possible side effects from the use of ampligen r or alferon n injection r could adversely affect potential revenues and physician patient acceptability of our product 
ampligen r 
we believe that ampligen r has been generally well tolerated with a low incidence of clinical toxicity  particularly given the severely debilitating or life threatening diseases that have been treated 
a mild flushing reaction has been observed in approximately of patients treated in our various studies 
this reaction is occasionally accompanied by a rapid heart beat  a tightness of the chest  urticaria swelling of the skin  anxiety  shortness of breath  subjective reports of feeling hot  sweating and nausea 
the reaction is usually infusion rate related and can generally be controlled by reducing the rate of infusion 
other adverse side effects include liver enzyme level elevations  diarrhea  itching  asthma  low blood pressure  photophobia  rash  transient visual disturbances  slow or irregular heart rate  decreases in platelets and white blood cell counts  anemia  dizziness  confusion  elevation of kidney function tests  occasional temporary hair loss and various flu like symptoms  including fever  chills  fatigue  muscular aches  joint pains  headaches  nausea and vomiting 
these flu like side effects typically subside within several months 
one or more of the potential side effects might deter usage of ampligen r in certain clinical situations and therefore  could adversely affect potential revenues and physician patient acceptability of our product 
alferon n injection r 
at present  alferon n injection r is only approved for the intra lesional within the lesion treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in adults 
in clinical trials conducted for the treatment of genital warts with alferon n injection r  patients did not experience serious side effects  however  there can be no assurance that unexpected or unacceptable side effects will not be found in the future for this use or other potential uses of alferon n injection r which could threaten or limit such product s usefulness 
we may be subject to product liability claims from the use of ampligen r  alferon n injection r  or other of our products which could negatively affect our future operations 
we have temporarily discontinued product liability insurance 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of ampligen r or other of our products results in adverse effects 
this liability might result from claims made directly by patients  hospitals  clinics or other consumers  or by pharmaceutical companies or others manufacturing these products on our behalf 
our future operations may be negatively affected from the litigation costs  settlement expenses and lost product sales inherent to these claims 
while we will continue to attempt to take appropriate precautions  we cannot assure that we will avoid significant product liability exposure 
on november   as we disclosed in an k  we suspended product liability insurance for alferon r n and ampligen r until we receive regulatory clearance for ampligen r 
we now require third parties to indemnify us in conjunction with all overseas emergency sales of ampligen r and alferon r ldo 
we concluded that years of successfully addressing the limited number of product liability claims filed against ampligen r and alferon r ldo  combined with the mandatory patient waivers completed as an element of clinical trials and lack of any commercial sales since april  that temporarily discontinuing the liability insurance was an acceptable risk given our financial condition and need to conserve cash 
currently  without product liability coverage for ampligen r and alferon r ldo  a claim against the products could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
the loss of services of key personnel including dr 
william a 
carter could hurt our chances for success 
our success is dependent on the continued efforts of our staff  especially certain doctors and researchers along with the continued efforts of dr 
william a 
carter because of his position as a pioneer in the field of nucleic acid drugs  his being the co inventor of ampligen r  and his knowledge of our overall activities  including patents and clinical trials 
as a result of our implementation of the employee wage or hours reduction program  our staff has agreed to take a portion of their compensation in shares of our common stock 
while we believe that our employees are dedicated to us and while we have incentivised them to remain with us through the establishment of a bonus pool that would award them money in the event that the fda approves our nda for ampligen r  we cannot assure that they will remain with us 
for information on the employee wage or hours reduction program and the bonus pool  please see item executive compensation  compensation discussion and analysis  elements of executive compensation  other compensation 
the loss of the services of personnel key to our operations or dr 
carter could have a material adverse effect on our operations and chances for success 
as a cash conservation measure  we have elected to discontinue the key man life insurance in the amount of  on the life of dr 
carter until we receive regulatory clearance for ampligen r 
an employment agreement continues to exist with dr 
carter that  as amended  runs until december  however  dr 
carter has the right to terminate his employment upon not less than days prior written notice 
the loss of dr 
carter or other personnel or the failure to recruit additional personnel as needed could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to achieve our objectives 
uncertainty of health care reimbursement for our products 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatment will be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and from time to time legislation is proposed  which  if adopted  could further restrict the prices charged by and or amounts reimbursable to manufacturers of pharmaceutical products 
we cannot predict what  if any  legislation will ultimately be adopted or the impact of such legislation on us 
there can be no assurance that third party insurance companies will allow us to charge and receive payments for products sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
there are risks of liabilities associated with handling and disposing of hazardous materials 
our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  carcinogenic chemicals  flammable solvents and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by applicable regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident or the failure to comply with applicable regulations  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could be significant 
we do not maintain insurance coverage against such liabilities 
risks associated with an investment in our common stock the market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be volatile 
this is especially true given the current significant instability in the financial markets 
in addition to general economic  political and market conditions  the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors  including o announcements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors  o adverse reactions to products  o governmental approvals  delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency concerns regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products  o changes in us or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development  o developments in patent or other proprietary rights  including any third party challenges of our intellectual property rights  o announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  o announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  o actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors  o changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates  o conditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries  o new accounting standards  o overall investment market fluctuation  and o occurrence of any of the risks described in these risk factors 
our common stock is listed for quotation on the nyse alternext us formerly  the american stock exchange 
for the month period ended december   the price of our common stock has ranged from to per share 
we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile 
the average daily trading volume of our common stock varies significantly 
our relatively low average volume and low average number of transactions per day may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market at prevailing prices and a more active market may never develop 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies in our industry 
if we face securities litigation in the future  even if without merit or unsuccessful  it would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which would negatively impact our business 
our stock price may be adversely affected if a significant amount of shares are sold in the public market 
in connection with entering into the purchase agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion in august  we registered  shares in the aggregate  consisting of  shares which we may sell to fusion and  shares we have issued or may issue to fusion as commitment shares 
the number of shares ultimately offered for sale by fusion is dependent upon the number of shares purchased by fusion under the agreement 
the purchase price for the common stock to be sold to fusion pursuant to the purchase agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock 
under the rules of the nyse alternext us  we may not issue more than  shares of our outstanding shares as of july   the date of the purchase agreement without first obtaining the approval of stockholders 
in november  we received stockholder approval to issue the additional  shares 
it is anticipated that shares registered could be sold over a period of up to months after the registration statement is declared effective 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  a sale of shares by fusion at any given time could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
fusion may ultimately purchase all  some or none of the  shares of common stock to be registered but not yet issued 
after it has acquired such shares  it may sell all  some or none of such shares 
therefore  sales to fusion by us under the purchase agreement may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by fusion  or anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
however  we have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to fusion and the agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us 
in addition to the  shares registered for fusion  we have previously registered of  shares issuable upon exercise of warrants related to our former convertible debentures and  shares issuable upon exercise of certain other warrants 
to the extent the exercise price of the warrants is less than the market price of the common stock  the holders of the warrants are likely to exercise them and sell the underlying shares of common stock and to the extent that the conversion price and exercise price of these securities are adjusted pursuant to anti dilution protection  the securities could be exercisable or convertible for even more shares of common stock 
we also may issue shares to be used to meet our capital requirements or use shares to compensate employees  consultants and or directors 
in this regard we previously registered  worth of our securities in a universal shelf registration statement  none of which has been designated or issued 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decrease 
furthermore  a decline in the price of our common stock would likely impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could defer a change of our management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management  and might discourage a third party from offering to acquire us  even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
as a result  our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation  the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares  together with a premium  prior to the redemption of our common stock 
in this regard  in november  we adopted a stockholder rights plan and  under the plan  our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on november  each right initially entitles holders to buy one unit of preferred stock for 
the rights generally are not transferable apart from the common stock and will not be exercisable unless and until a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire  beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock 
however  for dr 
carter  our chief executive officer  who already beneficially owns of our common stock  the plan s threshold will be  instead of 
the rights will expire on november   and may be redeemed prior thereto at 
per right under certain circumstances

further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise 
in addition  we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
our research in clinical efforts may continue for the next several years and we may continue to incur losses due to clinical costs incurred in the development of ampligen r for commercial application 
possible losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of significant expenses incurred and receipt of licensing fees and or cost recovery treatment revenues in europe  canada and the united states

you should read the information before item b above  special note regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of information 
background we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the manufacture and clinical development of new drug entities for treatment of seriously debilitating disorders 
our flagship products include alferon n injection r and the experimental therapeutics ampligen r and oragens 
alferon n injection r is approved for a category of std infection  and ampligen r and oragens represent experimental rna nucleic acids being developed for globally important viral diseases and disorders of the immune system 
hemispherx s platform technology includes large and small agent components for potential treatment of various severely debilitating and life threatening diseases 
we have in excess of patents comprising our core intellectual property estate  a product alferon n injection r and gmp certified manufacturing facilities for our novel pharmaceutical products 
we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred  as expected  substantial operating losses due to our conducting research and development programs 
results of operations year ended december  versus december  net loss our net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was lower when compared to the same period in this  reduction in loss was primarily due to research and development costs in included significant expenses related to the preparation of the ampligen r nda as well as expenses related to the production of ampligen r for use in stability studies and preparation of pre commercial lots for regulatory review purposes 
research and development expenses in were down approximately  as compared to the same period in alferon n injection r had seen increased competition from the use of topical solutions for genital warts 
additionally  there were no sales of alferon n injection r for the last nine months of as finished goods inventory has reached its current product expiration date of march  sales of alferon n injection r for the twelve months ended december  and amounted to approximately  and  respectively for a reduction of  or 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  during the twelve months ended december  versus the same period a year ago primarily due to reductions in the cost of non cash stock compensation of  director fees for  impairment charges for  and accounting fees of  that were offset with an increase of legal fees for  resulting from litigation expenses 
impairment charges of  incurred during the year ended december  primarily due to the write down of royalty interest of patents acquired from isi on alferon n infection r and charges taken against a water purification system that was determined not needed for use at the new brunswick  nj facility due to a change in manufacturing plans 
interest and other income decreased  or for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in due to a reduction of funds available to invest as compared to the prior period and compounded by lower the interest rates 
production cost of goods sold were lower in by  this decrease reflects a lower cost of sales in offset by fixed costs in manufacturing which could not be applied inventory due to the halting of alferon r n production 
in september  an increase of  in other income occurred due to the reversal of accrued liquidated damages in with respect to our debentures 
these damages related to certain debenture covenants were settled without charge in the maturation and pay down of the debenture holder s outstanding loan balances in net loss per share was for the current period versus for the same period in revenues revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to revenues of  for the same period in ampligen r sold under the cost recovery clinical program was down  and alferon n injection r sales were down  or as compared to the prior period 
ampligen r sold under the cost recovery clinical program is a product of physicians and me cfs patients applying to us to enroll in the program 
this program has been in effect for several years and is offered as a treatment option to patients severely affected by cfs 
as the name cost recovery implies  we have no gain or profit on these sales 
the benefits to us include physicians and patients becoming familiar with ampligen r  and collection of clinical data relating to the patients treatment and results 
revenues from our ampligen r cost recovery program were down as fewer patients are participating in the program 
our clinical staff has not encouraged cost recovery clinical enrollments in order that our internal resources could address the ampligen r new drug application nda and related documents preparatory to filing for a full commercial license 
the primary reason for the drop in the sales alferon r for the twelve months ended december  is that commercial sales of alferon n injection r were halted in april as the expiration date of our finished good inventory expired in march as a result  we had no product to sell for the last nine months of production costs cost of goods sold production cost of goods sold was approximately  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and this represented a decrease of approximately  or as compared to the same period in these costs primarily represent costs of goods sold of approximately  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and  and costs to maintain alferon n injection r inventory including storage  stability testing and reporting costs incurred in our attempt to have the fda extend the commercial sales life of our alferon n injection r finished goods 
the primary reason for the decrease in cost of goods sold can be attributed to the lack of alferon n injection r sales since april  and its impact on costs of goods sold 
research and development costs overall research and development costs for the twelve months ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period a year ago reflecting a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily due to reduced outside consulting fees and other costs related to the preparation and filing of our nda for ampligen r 
on july  we were notified that the fda had accepted for review our amended nda filing for using ampligen r to treat cfs 
fda approval of this application would provide the first ever treatment for cfs 
at present  only supportive symptom based care is available for cfs patients 
while we are optimistic  there are no assurances that the nda will be approved 
over the summer of  our clinical monitors visited our sites associated with our amp cost recovery treatment program for the collection and audit of additional data to be submitted to the fda in support of our nda for cfs currently under review 
fda inspections of several clinical sites did not result in the issuance of any reports indicating lack of compliance with various regulations governing clinical trials 
on february   we were notified by the fda that the originally scheduled prescription drug user fee act pdufa date of february  has been extended to may  for more information on our nda  please see note subsequent events under notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  we spent considerable time and effort preparing for the preapproval inspection by the us fda for manufacturing of ampligen r product and its raw materials  polynucleotides poly i and poly cu 
a satisfactory recommendation from the fda office of compliance based upon an acceptable preapproval inspection is required prior to approval of the product 
the preapproval inspection determines compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmps as well as a product specific evaluation concerning the manufacturing process of product 
the inspection includes many aspects of the cgmp requirements  such as manufacturing process validation  equipment qualification  analytical method validation  facility cleaning  quality systems  documentation system and part compliance 
the new jersey district office of the fda conducted an inspection of the new brunswick  new jersey facility in late january and early february nine days total 
a one page form fda was issued citing a need to re perform four method validations to generate data in the new brunswick laboratories 
these validations had been performed at another site also owned and operated by us prior to transferring the equipment to new brunswick 
we anticipate that the validations will be re performed and completed at the new brunswick site within three months 
the fda conducted a field inspection at hollister stier laboratories in spokane  washington in mid june to july  
the ampligen r final fill operations are performed under contract with hollister stier 
the inspection resulted in a form fda with two observations dealing with reviews and validations of process variability 
we are working with hollister stier to finalize specific actions 
on september   we executed an agreement with lovelace respiratory research institute in albuquerque  new mexico to perform certain animal toxic studies in support of our ampligen r nda 
these studies were requested by the fda and will be done in collaboration with the resources of the new brunswick facility 
we expect these studies to be complete in april we are also engaged in ongoing  experimental studies assessing the efficacy of ampligen r  alferon n injection r  and alferon r ldo against influenza viruses as a single adjuvant agent antiviral with japan s national institute of infectious disease  biken the non profit operational arm of the foundation for microbial diseases of osaka university and st 
vincent s hospital in darlinghurst  australia 
as a result of focusing our limited resources on the australian and japanese studies  no further experiments have been undertaken by the defence r d canada with respect to their independent study assessing the efficacy of ampligen r against influenza viruses as a single agent antiviral 
the biken arrangement was concluded in december and basically consists of biken purchasing ampligen r for use in conducting further animal studies of intranasal prototype vaccines containing antigens from influenza sub types hn  hn and b progressing to human studies with all programs supported by the japanese health ministry 
under the terms of the non exclusive licensing arrangement  we will receive royalties as well as income for all ampligen r used in the ongoing experimental work and any subsequent marketing of ampligen r as an immuno enhancer for flu vaccines delivered intranasally in japan 
to date  only two or three pharma companies worldwide have achieved regulatory authorizations to sell intranasally in administered influenza vaccines versus many companies receiving approval for intramuscular vaccine delivery routes 
safety has been paramount in developing effective treatments 
however  animal studies to date indicate ampligen r  an experimental drug  may be safely administered intranasally 
clinical studies in other disorders have built a database of more than  injections of ampligen r when given parenterally intravenous  or iv 
in june  biken notified us they were accelerating their program and were shipped additional ampligen r supplies for various preclinical vaccine studies and research projects that remain in progress 
a secondary goal of the trial is to evaluate whether antibodies stimulated by the vaccine ampligen r combination also provide protection against hn  the avian influenza virus 
since  the world health organization has confirmed cases and attributed human deaths worldwide to hn investigators from japan s institute of infectious disease have conducted studies in animals that suggest that ampligen r can stimulate a sufficiently broad immune response to provide cross protection against a range of virus strains  including hn the clinical trial in australia is using ampligen r in combination with seasonal flu vaccine 
this open label study phase iia utilizing ampligen r poly i poly cu as a potential immune enhancer was conducted in australia with thirty eight subjects age or greater with the standard trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines 
ampligen r was administered subcutaneously 
elderly subjects typically have reduced immune responses relative to younger populations 
the combinational treatment was generally well tolerated 
serologic studies to evaluate the magnitude and spectrum of immune response are pending and are expected by mid  however  only certain labs are qualified to conduct these tests and during the course of the clinical testing  one of these testing labs changed ownership 
we are in the process of determining that the methodology remained validated and consistent with the pilot results obtained about a year earlier with a smaller group consisting of the first enrolled subjects 
as reported in the journal of american medical association in by thompson  shay  weintraub  brammer  cox  anderson  et al 
seasonal influenza kills approximately  americans annually  most over the age of in in jama  the same authors attributed  us hospital admissions annually to seasonal flu 
collaboration studies in non human primates conducted by viroclinics in the netherlands suggest a potential role for alferon r ldo as another novel therapeutic approach to viral pandemics 
meetings with prospective partners are underway with respect to conducting clinical trials using alferon ldo to treat and or prevent seasonal influenza in the pacific rim countries 
alferon ldo is now poised for clinical trials against seasonal influenza epidemics  meetings with prospective partners are ongoing to conduct clinical trials in the pacific rim countries and elsewhere 
the opportunity for alferon r ldo is reinforced by new reports of severe side effects secondary to tamiflu  the present standard of care  by both the fda and japanese health authorities 
also  tamiflu resistant strains of flu virus are now raising serious concerns on a world wide basis 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of  or primarily due to reductions in the cost of non cash stock compensation of  director fees for  impairment charges of  accounting fees of  and various other general administrative expenses that were partially offset by an increase of legal fees for  resulting from litigation to settle existing suits 
in  we incurred impairment charges amounting to  as compared to no such charges in the current year 
the primary reason for these charges stemmed from the  write down of a water purification system that was determined to be unnecessary at our new jersey facility due to a change in manufacturing plans 
additionally in  we wrote down the value of our intangible asset associated with the repurchase of a royalty on alferon n injection r sales by  we determined in that we did not have sufficient inventory on hand to realize the full economic benefit of this asset  therefore  it was written down to its net realizable value 
reversal of previously accrued interest expense in september  and increase of  in other income occurred due to the reversal of accrued liquidated damages in with respect to our debentures holders 
these damages related to certain debenture covenants were settled without charge in the maturation and pay down of the debenture holder s outstanding loan balance in interest and other income interest and other income for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest and other income during the current period was mainly due to a reduction in funds available for short term investments compounded by the lower interest rates 
interest expense and financing costs we had no interest expense or non cash financing costs for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  for the same period a year ago 
the expenses reflected for the year ended reflect financing costs and interest charges related to our convertible debentures which matured in june when all outstanding loan balances were paid 
year ended december  versus december  net loss our net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was lower when compared to the same period in this  reduction in loss was primarily due to higher interest and other income of approximately  mainly due to higher interest earned upon the maturity of our marketable securities as compared to the same period a year ago  lower interest expense and financing costs of  in relating to the amortization of debt discounts on our convertible debentures and the incurring of liquidated damages in payable to our debenture holders resulting from us failing to timely file our annual report on form k  and an increase of  in other income due to a reversal of accrued liquidated damages in with respect to our debentures holders as a result of our failure to timely file our annual report on form k 
these damages related to certain debenture covenants settled without charge in the maturation and pay down of the debenture holder s outstanding loan balances in net loss per share was for the current period versus for the same period in revenues revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to revenues of  for the same period in ampligen r sold under the cost recovery clinical program was down  or and alferon n injection r sales were up  or as compared to the prior period 
ampligen r sold under the cost recovery clinical program is a product of physicians and me cfs patients applying to us to enroll in the program 
this program has been in effect for several years and is offered as a treatment option to patients severely affected by cfs 
as the name cost recovery implies  we have no gain or profit on these sales 
the benefits to us include physicians and patients becoming familiar with ampligen r and collection of clinical data relating to the patients treatment and results 
we altered our marketing strategy for alferon n injection r by relaunching the product via a collaborative marketing initiative between hemispherx and a national specialty pharmacy network encompassing specialty pharmacists  pharmacies and targeted physician specialists 
this effort was intended to focus our efforts in the most appropriate and productive market segment for the product 
while alferon n dollar sales are up from  unit sales are down which reflects the effect of the price increase put into place in february production costs cost of goods sold production cost of goods sold was approximately  during the current period representing a decrease of approximately  or as compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to lower production costs of  relating to excess production capacity during the prior period as more effort was directed toward ampligen r research and development and the nda  and a decrease in costs of goods sold of  costs of goods sold for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in unit sales in the current year versus the prior year 
we outsourced certain components of our overall research and development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution while maintaining control over the entire process through our quality assurance group and our clinical monitoring group 
research and development costs overall research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period a year ago representing an increase of  or 
these costs are primarily related to the collection and processing of clinical data  including the costs of establishing our in house polymer production facility and the costs of preparing and completing our nda for the use of ampligen r in treating cfs 
the year to year increase can be basically attributed to an increase in the use of consultants related to the preparation of our ampligen r nda 
our primary focus in was on the preparation of the nda for using ampligen r to treat patients affected with cfs 
in addition  we documented our polymer production process in anticipation of an fda inspection 
three lots of liquid ampligen r were produced for use in testing and stability studies 
we finalized the filing of our ampligen r nda on october  much of our r d cost is related to production of raw materials at our new production line installed at our new brunswick facility 
this facility produces poly i and poly cu for use by hollister stier our contract manufacturer in the manufacture of ampligen r 
the first pilot production runs are being used for stability testing 
later commercial sized runs are being used for process validation and clinical use 
in addition  we are engaged in broad based  ongoing  experimental studies assessing the efficacy of ampligen r  alferon n injection r  and alferon ldo against influenza viruses as an adjuvant single agent antiviral with defence r d canada  japan s national institute of infectious disease  biken the non profit operational arm of the foundation for microbial diseases of osaka university and st

clinical studies in other disorders have built a database of more than  injections of ampligen r when given parenterally intravenous  or iv 
in september  japan s national institute of infectious disease jniid initiated research on the co administration of jniid s hiv vaccine with our experimental tlr agonist a substance that binds to a specific receptor and triggers a host defense response in the cell and immune enhancer  ampligen r 
this research is the result of earlier research suggesting a potential role for ampligen r in boosting responses to certain vaccines designed to combat avian influenza bird flu as well as seasonal influenza viruses 
the objective of this research is to determine if ampligen r can overcome the historical problem which has handicapped aids vaccine development  namely marginal immune response which undermines the potential of long lasting protection 
ampligen r will be combined with hiv recombinant protein and administered via an intranasal route 
in june  we initiated a clinical trial in australia using ampligen r in combination with seasonal flu vaccine 
this trial  expected to continue for several months  is being conducted in australia s winter season and focuses on populations at risk for virulent cases of influenza  especially those over the age of years who historically may have weakened immune systems 
the australian clinical trial was prompted by the results from the pre clinical work conducted by the jniid see above 
thirty patients were enrolled in this study  which utilized a two dose ampligen r regimen of mg per dose 
this study was monitored by clinical network services pty 
ltd 
located in brisbane  australia 
the clinical trials center of st 
vincent s hospital based in darlinghurst  australia conducted the trial 
the clinical data from this trial is currently being analyzed with the results expected by mid the cdc reports that the number of mosquito borne west nile virus wnv infections in the united states is up sharply over the same period in this increased infection rate has accelerated the enrollment of patients in our phase iib clinical trial using alferon n tm to treat wnv patients 
in lab studies  alferon r n  a natural cocktail of eight alpha interferons  shows synergistic effects up to fold over recombinant interferons against pathogens such as wnv 
the phase iib clinical trial is a double blinded  randomized  multi center program under the direction of cornell university and weill cornell medical college new york hospital 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  reflecting an increase of  or 
this increase related primarily to an increase in legal and professional fees of  primarily due to on going litigation involving bioclones  increase in travel related expenses of  and increases in salaries and wages of  mainly resulting from the hire of our chief operating officer during the th quarter these increases in general and administrative costs were offset by lower accounting fees of  in the decrease in accounting fees was primarily due to charges incurred by us in related to the restatements to our financial statements in lastly  we incurred impairment losses in amounting to  as compared to no such charges in the prior year 
the primary reason for these charges stemmed from the  write down of a water purification system that was determined to be unnecessary at our new jersey facility due to a change in manufacturing plans 
in addition  we wrote down the value of our intangible asset associated with the repurchase of a royalty on alferon n injection sales by  we determined that we did not have sufficient inventory on hand to realize the full economic benefit of this asset  therefore  it was written down to its net realizable value 
reversal of previously accrued interest expense reversal of previously accrued interest expense was  for the year ended december  this item  classified as other income  resulted from the reversal of accrued liquidated damages in related to a certain covenant in our debenture agreements 
these charges were incurred as a result of our failure to timely file our annual report on form k and our report on form q for the quarterly period ended march  with the sec pursuant to the act 
these liquidated damages were not included as part of the maturation and pay down of the debenture holder s outstanding loan balances 
interest and other income interest and other income for the year ended december  and increased approximately  as compared to the same period a year earlier 
the increase in interest and other income during the current period was mainly due to higher interest earned upon the maturity of our marketable securities as compared to the same period a year ago 
interest expense and financing costs interest expense and non cash financing costs were approximately  for the year ended december  versus  for the same period a year ago 
the main reason for the decrease in interest expense and financing costs of  or can be attributed to decreased amortization charges on debt discounts and the incurring of liquidated damages in payable to our debenture holders resulting from our failure to timely file our annual report on form k as we were in violation of provisions within our debenture agreements 
these debentures matured in june and all outstanding loan balances were paid off 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  reflecting mainly expenditures for the preparation and filing of the ampligen r nda 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ending december   amounted to  primarily from the maturity of short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  amounted to  basically from the sale of common stock 
as of february  we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  or a decrease of approximately from december  given the harsh economic conditions  we have reviewed every aspect of our operations for cost and spending reductions to assure the long term survival of our company while maintaining the resources necessary to achieve our primary objectives of obtaining nda approval of ampligen r and securing a strategic partner 
we believe  but cannot assure  that our current funds should be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the next months as we have taken the steps discussed below to curtail discretionary spending to conserve cash and reduce our monthly burn rate 
please see item a 
risk factors  we may require additional financing which may not be available 
in an effort to conserve company cash  the employee wage or hours reduction program the program was ratified by the board effective january  in a mandatory program that is estimated to be in effect for up to six months  compensation of all active full time employees as of january  participants were reduced through a reduction in their wages for which they would be eligible to receive shares of our common stock stock six months after the shares were earned 
while all employees were also offered the option to reduce their work hours with a proportional decease in wages  none elected this alternative 
for more information  please see item executive compensation  compensation discussion and analysis  elements of executive compensation  other compensation 
in addition  certain vendors and service providers have agreed to accept shares of our common stock as partial payment of their bills 
in  we issued  shares of common stock for services rendered 
notwithstanding our cost and spending reduction activities  we may need to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen r products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  especially considering current adverse market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory process  and higher than anticipated expenses and lower than anticipated revenues from certain of our clinical trials for which cost recovery from participants has been approved 
we have been using the proceeds from financing to fund infrastructure growth including manufacturing  regulatory compliance and market development 
due to current market conditions  we have been unable to consistently raise funds pursuant to the terms of the fusion purchase agreement see equity financing below 
standby financing agreement in february  we entered into a standby financing agreement pursuant to which certain individuals individuals  consisting of dr 
carter and thomas equels  agreed to loan us up to an aggregate of  in funds should we be unable to obtain additional financing  if needed 
under the standby financing agreement  we will use our best efforts in to obtain one or more additional financing agreements on such terms as our board deems to be reasonable and appropriate in order to maintain our operations 
if at any time after december  and prior to june  a majority of our independent directors deems that in the event a financing of at least million has not been obtained and additional funds are needed to maintain our operations  we will send a written notice to each of the individuals informing them of the total amount of additional funds required and the specific amount that will be required from each individual 
within fifteen calendar days after receipt of the notice  the individuals will be required to pay us their respective amount 
we will then issue to them one year senior secured notes for their respective amounts the notes 
interest will be paid monthly in our common stock 
repayment of the principal and interest under the notes will be secured by all of our assets 
we will not  without the consent of the individuals  i incur any new debt senior or pari passu to the notes or ii encumber or grant a security interest in any assets 
upon business days written notice  we may prepay the notes in cash at any time at of the then outstanding principal amount of the notes  plus any accrued but unpaid interest 
for agreeing to be obligated to loan us money  each individual received year warrants the commitment warrants to purchase our common stock at the rate of  worth in warrants per  committed 
the exercise price of these warrants is of the market closing price of our common stock on the date that agreement was executed 
these warrants vested immediately 
if and when we notify the individuals that we are consummating the standby financing  upon each individual s payment of his committed amount  he will receive additional year warrants to purchase our common stock at the rate of  worth in warrants per  paid 
the exercise price of the warrants will be the closing market price of our common stock on the day we receive the funds from the individuals 
these warrants will vest immediately 
while any portion of the notes are outstanding  individuals will have weighted average anti dilution rights with regard to the exercise price of all warrants issued pursuant hereto except that these rights will not apply if the securities are issued to employees  board members  corporate and scientific advisors  select vendors  pursuant to our current agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc or part of a corporate or strategic alliance 
equity financing in july  we entered into a million common stock purchase agreement the purchase agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion  an illinois limited liability company 
concurrently with entering into the purchase agreement  we entered into a registration rights agreement with fusion 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  we filed a registration statement related to the transaction with the us securities and exchange commission sec covering  shares that have been issued or may be issued to fusion under the purchase agreement 
the sec declared effective the registration statement on august  we have the right over a month period to sell our shares of common stock to fusion from time to time in amounts between  and million depending on certain conditions as set forth in the agreement  up to a maximum of million 
the purchase price of the shares related to the million of future funding will be based on the prevailing market prices of our shares at the time of sales as computed under the purchase agreement without any fixed discount  and we will control the timing and amount of any sales of shares to fusion 
fusion shall not have the right or the obligation to purchase any shares of our common stock on any business day that the price of our common stock is below 
recently  the price of our common stock has consistently fallen been below and  accordingly  no additional sales can be made to fusion unless and until the price rises to per share or better for consecutive business days 
the purchase agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us 
there are no negative covenants  restrictions on future funding  penalties or liquidated damages in the agreement 
in consideration for entering into the purchase agreement  upon execution of the purchase agreement we issued to fusion  shares as a commitment fee 
also  we will issue to fusion up to an additional  shares as a commitment fee pro rata as we receive up to the million of future funding 
under the rules of the nyse alternext us  we may issue no more than  shares of our outstanding shares as of july   the date of the purchase agreement without first obtaining the approval of stockholders 
that approval was obtained on november  as of december   we have executed transactions pursuant the fusion stock purchase agreement valued at  and  shares  which includes  shares as the initial fee for the financing 
the proceeds from this financing have been used to fund infrastructure growth including manufacturing  regulatory compliance and market development 
in april we entered into a prior common stock purchase agreement with fusion  pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  shares for total gross proceeds of approximately  through november  this agreement expired on july  because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
in this regard we also have previously registered  worth of our securities in a universal shelf registration statement  none of which has been designated or issued 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory processes  including the commercializing of ampligen r products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products

our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following revenue revenue from the sale of ampligen r under cost recovery clinical treatment protocols approved by the fda is recognized when the treatment is provided to the patient 
revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product is shipped  as title is transferred to the customer 
we have no other obligation associated with our products once shipment has occurred 
inventories we use the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market method of accounting for inventory 
patents and trademarks patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years 
we review our patents and trademark rights periodically to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent and trademark s ultimate revenue and profitability potential 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans 
stock based compensation under fas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we adopted the provisions of fas r  effective january   using a modified prospective application 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
because we previously adopted only the pro forma disclosure provisions of fas  we recognize compensation cost relating to the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the date of adoption  using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosures under fas  except that forfeiture rates are estimated for all options  as required by fas r 
the cumulative effect of applying the forfeiture rates is not material 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
we use uses historical data to estimate expected dividend yield  expected life and forfeiture rates 
concentration of credit risk our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being credit worthy  or in short term money markets  which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risks 
at and since december   we have had bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed federally insured limits 
concentration of credit risk  with respect to receivables  is limited through our credit evaluation process 
we do not require collateral on our receivables 
our receivables consist principally of amounts due from wholesale drug companies as of december  and sales to three large wholesalers represented approximately and of our total sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents at december  to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents exceed our near term funding needs  we invest the excess cash in three to twelve month interest bearing financial instruments 
we employ established conservative policies and procedures to manage any risks with respect to investment exposure 
we have not entered into  and do not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes
