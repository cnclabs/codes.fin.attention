growth strategy the company s strategy is one of value added growth 
management believes that qualitative and sustainable growth of the company  coupled with maintaining profitability  is currently the most appropriate path to providing good value for its shareholders 
to date  the company s growth has been achieved organically and it attributes its reputation for focusing on customer service and satisfaction as one of the cornerstones to the company s success 
the company s primary objectives are to improve profitability and operating efficiencies  increase market penetration in areas currently served  and to continue an expansion strategy in appropriate market areas 
the company s geographical expansion to date has primarily been concentrated along the i corridor from snohomish to whatcom counties  however  additional areas will be considered if they meet the company s criteria 
acquisition of banks or branches may also be used as a means of expansion if appropriate opportunities are presented 
the primary factors considered in determining the areas of geographic expansion are the availability of knowledgeable personnel  such as managers and lending officers with experience in their fields of expertise  longstanding community presence and extensive banking relationships  customer demand and perceived market potential 
management believes that increasing the success of current branches and expanding into appropriate market places while managing up front costs is an excellent way to build franchise value and increase business 
the company s strategy is to support its employees in providing a high level of personal service to its customers while expanding the loan  deposit and investment products and other services that the company offers 
maintenance of asset quality will be emphasized by controlling nonperforming assets and adhering to prudent underwriting standards 
in addition  management will maintain its focus on improving operating efficiencies and internal operating systems to further manage noninterest expense 
growth requires expenditures of substantial sums to purchase or lease real property and equipment and to hire experienced personnel 
new branch offices are often not profitable for a period of time after opening and management expects that earnings may be negatively affected in the short term 
market areas the company s primary market area currently consists of island  skagit  whatcom  snohomish and san juan counties in northwest washington state 
although the pacific northwest is typically associated with industries such as computer technology  aerospace and coffee  the company s market encompasses distinct economies that are somewhat removed from the seattle metropolitan region 
island county s largest population center  oak harbor  is dominated by a large military presence with naval operations at nas whidbey island 
the jobs generated by nas whidbey contribute significantly to the county s economy 
other primary industries providing employment for county residents are education  health and social services  retail trade  and manufacturing 
due to its natural beauty  the county attracts tourism and has a number of retirement communities 
the economy of skagit county is primarily comprised of agriculture  fishing  wood products  tourism  international trade  and specialized manufacturing 
with its accessible ports and refineries  skagit county is the center of the state s petroleum industry 
whatcom county  which borders canada  has an economy with a prominent manufacturing base  as well as a significant academic research and vocational technical base  as it is the home of western washington university  one of washington s largest four year academic centers 
the united states customs and border patrol and municipal  county and state governments give whatcom county an additional employment base 
snohomish county industrial sectors include aerospace  biotechnology  and electronics  as well as a military naval base and large retail influences 
the economy of san juan county is predominantly comprised of retail trade  tourism  finance and insurance  and real estate services 
the county is known for its beautiful locale  which attracts many visitors  and serves as a second home to an affluent sector of the population 
competition the company operates in a highly competitive banking environment  competing for deposits  loans and other financial services with a number of larger and well established commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions and other institutions  including nonbanking financial services companies 
some of the bank s competitors are not subject to the same regulations as the bank  they may have substantially higher lending limits  and may offer certain services that the bank does not provide 
federal law allows mergers or other combinations  relocations of a bank s main office and branching across state lines 
recent amendments to the federal banking laws to eliminate certain barriers between banking and commercial firms are expected to result in even greater competition in the future 
although the company has been able to compete effectively in its market areas to date  there can be no assurance that the company s competitive efforts will continue to be successful

gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act 
congress enacted major federal financial institution reform legislation in title i of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act  which became effective march   allows bank holding companies to elect to become financial holding companies 
in addition to activities previously permitted bank holding companies  financial holding companies may engage in nonbanking activities that are financial in nature  such as securities  insurance and merchant banking activities  subject to certain limitations 
the activities of bank holding companies  such as the company that are not financial holding companies  are generally limited to managing or controlling banks 
a bank holding company is required to obtain the prior approval of the frb for the acquisition of more than of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company 
nonbank acquisitions by bank holding companies such as the company are generally limited to of voting shares of a company and activities previously determined by the frb by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking or managing or controlling banks 
the glb act also included the most extensive consumer privacy provisions ever enacted by congress 
these provisions  among other things  require full disclosure of the company s privacy policy to consumers and mandate offering the consumer the ability to opt out of having non public personal information disclosed to third parties 
pursuant to these provisions  the federal banking regulators have adopted privacy regulations 
in addition  the states are permitted to adopt more extensive privacy protections through legislation or regulation 
the company does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about its customers or former customers to anyone  except as permitted by law 
additional legislation may be enacted or regulations imposed to further regulate banking and financial services or to limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in such activities 
there can be no assurance whether any such legislation or regulation will place additional limitations on the company s operations or adversely affect its earnings 
there are various legal restrictions on transactions between the company and any nonbank subsidiaries  and between the company and the bank 
with certain exceptions  federal law also imposes limitations on  and requires collateral for  extensions of credit by insured depository institutions  such as the bank  to their nonbank affiliates  such as the company 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of interstate act permits nationwide interstate banking and branching under certain circumstances 
subject to certain limitations and restrictions  a bank holding company  with prior approval of the frb  may acquire an out of state bank 
banks in states that do not prohibit out of state mergers may merge with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency 
a state bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is expressly permitted by the other state 
federal and state bank regulation 
among other things  applicable federal and state statutes and regulations which govern a bank s activities relate to minimum capital requirements  required reserves against deposits  investments  loans  legal lending limits  mergers and consolidations  borrowings  issuance of securities  payment of dividends  establishment of branches and other aspects of its operations 
the division and the fdic also have authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what they consider to be unsafe and unsound practices 
specifically with regard to the payment of dividends  there are certain limitations on the ability of the company to pay dividends to its shareholders 
it is the policy of the frb that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 
various federal and state statutory provisions also limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval 
additionally  depending upon the circumstances  the fdic or the division could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practi ce 
under longstanding frb policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such banks 
the company could be required to commit resources to the bank in circumstances where it might not do so  absent such policy 
the bank is required to file periodic reports with the fdic and the division and is subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities 
these examinations must be conducted every months 
the fdic and the division may each accept the results of an examination by the other in lieu of conducting an independent examination 
in the liquidation or other resolution of a failed insured depository institution  deposits in offices and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims  including nondeposit claims  and claims of a parent company such as the company 
such priority creditors would include the fdic  which succeeds to the position of insured depositors 
federal deposit insurance 
the deposits of the bank are currently insured to the maximum amount allowable per depositor through the deposit insurance fund dif administered by the fdic 
in october  the fdic temporarily increased the amount of deposit insurance from  to  per depositor through december  the fdic also made unlimited deposit insurance coverage available for non interest bearing transactions accounts and certain low interest now accounts through december  at institutions participating in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
the bank is participating in the tlgp 
the fdic implemented a new risk based insurance premium system effective january  under which banks are assessed insurance premiums based on how much risk they present to the dif 
banks with higher levels of capital and a lower degree of supervisory risk are assessed lower premium rates than banks with lower levels of capital and or a higher degree of supervisory risk 
these premium rates are applied to the average balance of deposits in the prior quarter 
because the bank is participating in the tlgp  a basis point annual rate surcharge will be applied to non interest bearing transaction deposit amounts over  the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule in order to manage the dif to prescribed statutory target levels 
an increase in the assessment rate could have an adverse effect on the bank s earnings  depending upon the amount of the increase 
the fdic may terminate deposit insurance if it determines the instituti on involved has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition  or has violated applicable laws  regulations or orders 
in december of  the fdic adopted a rule that would further amend the system for risk based assessments and change assessment rates in attempts to restore targeted reserve ratios in the dif 
effective january   the risk based assessment rates will be uniformly raised seven basis points annualized 
furthermore  the fdic in february adopted additional modifications to the assessment system by requiring riskier institutions pay a larger share of the assessment 
characteristics of riskier institutions may include institutions with a significant reliance on secured liabilities or brokered deposits  particularly when combined with rapid asset growth 
the proposal would also provide incentives for institutions to hold long term unsecured debt and  for smaller institutions  high levels of tier capital 
these changes would be effective beginning april  the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law  regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by  or pursuant to  any written agreement with the fdic 
the termination of deposit insurance for the bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the fact that the bank s liquidity position would likely be affected by deposit withdrawal activity 
community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act cra requires that  in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction  regulators must evaluate the records of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those banks 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
capital adequacy 
the company and the bank are subject to risk based capital and leverage guidelines issued by federal banking agencies for banks and bank holding companies 
these agencies are required by law to take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards 
as of december   the company and the bank exceeded the minimum capital standards 
broad regulatory authority is given to the fdic if capital levels drop below minimum standards including restrictions on growth  acquisition  branching and new lines of business as well as interest rate restrictions on deposit gathering activities 
dividends 
the bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of cash dividends to the company 
the principal source of the company s cash flow is dividends received from the bank  the issuance of junior subordinated debentures  and cash received from the exercise of stock options 
regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in addition  a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet the adequately capitalized level in accordance with regulatory capital requirements 
also  the payment of cash dividends by the bank must satisfy a net profits test and an undivided profits test or the bank must obtain prior approval of its regulators before such dividend is paid 
the net profits test limits the dividend declared in any calendar year to the net profits of the current year plus retained net inco me of the preceding two years 
the undivided profits test limits the dividends declared to the undivided profits on hand after deducting bad debts in excess of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
washington law also provides that no cash dividend may be paid if  after giving effect to the dividend  a corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or a corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities 
federal securities laws  sarbanes oxley act of the company is also subject to the periodic reporting  information disclosure  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and regulation of the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees 
key components of the sarbanes oxley act are follows a prohibition on personal loans by the company to its directors and executive officers except loans made by the bank in accordance with federal banking regulations independence requirements for board audit committee members and the company s auditors certification of exchange act reports by the chief executive officer  chief financial officer and principal accounting officer disclosure of off balance sheet transactions expedited reporting of stock transactions by insiders increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws 
the sarbanes oxley act also requires management to establish  maintain and evaluate disclosure controls and procedures  management to report on its annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting  the company s external auditor to attest to the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting 
the sec has adopted regulations to implement various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  including disclosures in periodic filings pursuant to the exchange act 
also  in response to the sarbanes oxley act  nasdaq adopted new standards for listed companies 
usa patriot act of under the usa patriot act of patriot act  adopted by the us congress on october  to combat terrorism  fdic insured banks and commercial banks are required to increase their due diligence efforts for correspondent accounts and private banking customers 
the patriot act requires the bank to engage in additional record keeping or reporting  requiring identification of owners of accounts  or of the customers of foreign banks with accounts  and restricting or prohibiting certain correspondent accounts 
while management believes that the patriot act may affect recordkeeping and reporting expenses to some degree  it does not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operations 
emergency economic stabilization act of eesa 
eesa granted broad powers to the us department of the treasury  the fdic and the federal reserve to stabilize the financial markets under the following programs the capital purchase program allocated billion to treasury to purchase senior preferred shares and warrants to purchase commons stock from approved financial institutions  the troubled asset purchase program allocated billion to treasury to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions  with treasury to also receive securities issued by participating institutions  the temporary liquidity guaranty program authorized the fdic to insure newly issued senior unsecured debt and insure the total balance in non interest bearing transactional deposit accounts of those institutions who elect to participate  the commercial paper and money market investor funding facilities authorized the federal reserve bank of new york to purchase rated commercial paper from us companies and to purchase money market instruments from us money market mutual funds 
effects of governmental monetary policies profitability in banking depends on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest earned on a bank s loans  securities and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on a bank s deposits and other interest bearing liabilities is the major source of a bank s earnings 
thus  the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policy for such purposes as controlling inflation and recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing from the frb and the establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and also affect interest rates charg ed on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on the company are not predictable 
item a 
risk factors historical performance may not be indicative of future performance and  as noted elsewhere in this report  the company has included forward looking statements about its business  plans and prospects that are subject to change 
forward looking statements are particularly located in  but not limited to  the sections item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the other risks or uncertainties contained in this report  the following risks may affect operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
if any of these risks occur  either alone or in combination with other factors  the company s business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
moreover  readers should note this is not an exhaustive list  that some risks are unknown or not quantifiable  and other risks that are currently perceived as immaterial may ultimately prove more significant than expected 
statements about plans  predictions or expectations should not be construed to be assurances of performance or promises to take a given course of action 
a large percentage of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real estate  in particular commercial real estate 
continued deterioration in the real estate market or other segments of the company s loan portfolio would lead to additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations approximately of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real estate  the majority of which is commercial real estate 
as a result increased levels of commercial and consumer delinquencies and declining real estate values  the company has experienced increasing levels of net charge offs and allowances for loan losses 
continued increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or continued declines in real estate market values would require increased net charge offs and increases in the allowance for loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations and prospects 
future loan losses may exceed the allowance for loan losses the company has established a reserve for possible losses expected in connection with loans in the credit portfolio 
this allowance reflects estimates of the collectibility of certain identified loans  as well as an overall risk assessment of total loans outstanding 
the determination of the amount of loan loss allowance is subjective  although the method for determining the amount of the allowance uses criteria such as risk ratings and historical loss rates  these factors may not be adequate predictors of future loan performance 
accordingly  the company cannot offer assurances that these estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the loan loss allowance will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur 
if the loan loss allowance proves to be inadequate  it may require unexpected charges to income  which would adversely impact results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  bank regulators frequently monitor banks loan lo ss allowances  and if regulators were to determine that the allowance was inadequate  they may require the company to increase the allowance  which also would adversely impact revenues and financial condition 
defaults may negatively impact the company a source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
the company has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  which management believes are appropriate to minimize risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying the credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect results of operations 
a rapid change in interest rates could reduce the company s net interest margin  net interest income and fee income the company s earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans  the credit profile of existing loans  the rates received on loans and securities  and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relationship between the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings is known as the net interest spread 
based on the company s current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  net interest spread could be expected to increase during times when interest rates rise in a parallel shift along the yield curve and  conversely  to decline during times of similar falling interest rates 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the re pricing frequency of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over any given period 
although management believes the current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates could potentially have an adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk liquidity measures the ability to meet loan demand and deposit withdrawals and to service liabilities as they come due 
dramatic fluctuations in loan or deposit balances make it challenging to manage liquidity 
a sharp reduction in deposits could force the company to borrow heavily in the wholesale deposit market 
in addition  rapid loan growth during periods of low liquidity could induce the company to purchase federal funds from correspondent banks  borrow at the federal home loan bank of seattle or federal reserve discount window  raise deposit interest rates or reduce lending activity 
wholesale deposits and federal funds or other sources for borrowings may not be available to us due to regulatory constraints  market upheaval or unfavorable terms 
slower than anticipated growth from new branches  service offerings or acquisitions could result in reduced net income financial performance and profitability will depend on the company s ability to manage recent growth and potential future growth 
in addition  any future acquisitions and continued growth may present operating and other problems that could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to execute it s growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that it has achieved in the past 
internal control systems could fail to detect certain events the company is subject to many operating risks  including but not limited to data processing system failures and errors  and customer or employee fraud 
there can be no assurance that such an event will not occur  and if such an event is not prevented or detected by other company s internal controls and does occur  and it is uninsured or is in excess of applicable insurance limits  it could have a significant adverse impact on the company s reputation in the business community and the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s operations could be interrupted if third party service providers experience difficulty  terminate their services  or fail to comply with banking regulations the company depends  and will continue to depend to a significant extent  on a number of relationships with third party service providers 
specifically  the company utilizes software and hardware systems for processing  essential web hosting  debit and credit card processing  merchant processing  internet banking systems  and other processing services from third party service providers 
if these third party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services  and the company is unable to replace them with other qualified service providers  the company s operations could be interrupted 
if an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the network and computer systems on which the company depends could fail or experience a security breach the company s computer systems could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
because the company conducts part of its business over the internet and outsource several critical functions to third parties  operations depend on the company s ability  and to a degree on the ability of third party service providers to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  mechanical failure  software errors  operator errors  physical break ins  or similar catastrophic events 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  a significant barrier to online financial transactions is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
the company s internet banking system relies on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  fraud perpetrated by a customer  employee  or third party  or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the bank or our third party service providers use to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data  including non public customer information 
if any such compromise of security were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company may not be able to replace key members of management or attract and retain qualified employees in the future the company depends on the services of existing management to carry out its business strategies 
as the company expands  it will need to continue to attract and retain additional management and other qualified staff 
in particular  because the company plans to continue to expand its locations and products and services  it will need to continue to attract and retain qualified banking personnel 
competition for such personnel is significant in the company s geographic market areas 
the loss of the services of any management personnel  or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial conditions  and prospects 
the company s operations are geographically concentrated in northwest washington state substantially  all of the company s business is derived from a five county area in northwest washington state 
employment opportunities within these communities have traditionally been primarily in the areas of military spending  oil and gas industries  tourism and manufacturing 
while the company s expansion strategy has been built around these growing and diverse geographic markets  the company s business is  and will remain  sensitive to economic factors that relate to these industries and to local and regional business conditions 
as a result  local or regional economic downturns  or downturns that disproportionately affect one or more of the key industries in the company s markets  may have a more pronounced effect upon it s business than they might on an institution that is more broadly diverse in geographic concentration 
the extent of the future impact of these events on economic and business conditions cannot be predicted  ho wever  prolonged or acute fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact upon the company s results of operation and financial condition 
there are significant risks associated with potential acquisitions  including participating in fdic assisted acquisitions or assuming deposits from a troubled institution the company may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks  branches  financial institutions  or related businesses from time to time that it expects to further its business strategy 
these acquisitions could involve numerous risks  including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs  difficulties related to integration  diversion of management s attention from other business activities  changes in relationships with customers  and the potential loss of key employees 
any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such approval 
the company may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates  integrating acquired institutions  or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions 
competition for acquisitions in the company s market area is highly competitive  and the company may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions  or if such transactions are completed  that it will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into its operations 
the company s ability to grow may be limited if it chooses not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future 
the company s banking operations are subject to extensive government regulation that is expected to become more burdensome  increase its costs and make it less competitive compared to financial services firms that are not subject to the same regulation the company is subject to government regulation that could limit or restrict it s activities  which in turn could adversely impact operations 
the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  as well as shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
moreover  federal and state banking laws and regulations undergo frequent  significant changes 
changes in laws and regulations may affect the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities including insurance and securities activities  or the company s competitive position in relation to credit unions  savings associations and other financial institutions 
these changes could also reduce federal deposit insurance coverage  broaden the powers or geographic range of financial holding companies  alter the taxation of financial institutions an d change the structure and jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies 
federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  can significantly affect credit availability 
other federal legislation such as the sarbanes oxley act can dramatically shift resources and costs to ensure adequate compliance 
difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than twelve months 
dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities 
these write downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consum er confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity  generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events the company expects to face increased regulation of our industry  including as a result of the eesa and arra 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
government stimulus packages and other responses to the financial crises may not stabilize the economy or financial system 
the company s ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches the company uses to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors 
the process the company uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of the bank s borrowers to repay their loans  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
the company will be required to pay significantly higher federal deposit insurance corporation premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
there may be downward pressure on the company s stock price 
the company s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions and government sponsored entities 
the company may face increased competition due to intensified consolidation of the financial services industry
