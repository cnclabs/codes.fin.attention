item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a multi state managed healthcare company focused on serving people who receive healthcare benefits through publicly sponsored programs  including medicaid  chip  medicaid expansion and medicare advantage programs 
we were founded in december with the objective of becoming the leading managed care organization in the us focused on serving people who receive these types of benefits 
we continue to believe that managed healthcare remains the only proven mechanism that improves health outcomes for our members while helping our government customers manage the fiscal viability of their healthcare programs 
summary highlights for the year ended december  total revenues increased to billion  or over the year ended december   risk membership increased to  or compared to that as of december   began serving individuals in new mexico s colts program in august expanded geographic coverage in four new counties in florida  effective october   and retained all existing counties for the florida healthy kids program through a competitive bidding process  entered into an agreement to provide medicaid managed care services to tanf and chip populations in nevada beginning february  concluded our aso contract in west tennessee effective october  exited the district of columbia market effective june   entered into an agreement to sell the rights to provide managed care services under our south carolina subsidiary s medicaid contract  and reached a comprehensive settlement agreement concluding the civil qui tam litigation relating to certain marketing practices of the company s former illinois subsidiary 
revenue growth in premium revenue our premium revenue increased approximately million or for the year ended december   primarily due to the full year impact of operations in tennessee whose contract began in april as well as premium rate increases and yield increases resulting from membership mix changes in that market 
this includes the impact of a million retroactive premium rate adjustment in tennessee received in  which related to operations in additionally  our entry into the new mexico market  under the colts program beginning in august  contributed significantly to premium growth in the remaining growth in is a result of premium rate increases  including a retroactive premium rate adjustment in georgia of approximately million related to operations in  and yield increases resulting from changes in membership mix across many of our markets 
as of december   our total membership decreased by  members  or  to  members 
this decrease resulted primarily from the conclusion of our operations in west tennessee effective october   under which we provided aso services to approximately  members as of december  our risk membership increased to  as of december  compared to  as of december   or 
this increase is primarily a result of growth in our florida  maryland and south carolina markets  in addition to our entry into the new mexico market 
the current economic recession has and is expected to continue to put pressure on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the medicaid eligible population increases creating more need for funding 
we anticipate this will require the government agencies with whom we contract to find funding alternatives  which may result in reductions in funding for current programs and program expansions  contraction of covered benefits  
table of contents limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases 
these or other similar actions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity in future periods 
additionally  recent actions by the federal government  including the chip program expansion and the american recovery and reinvestment act of that temporarily increased the fmap match rate to state medicaid programs  will have an impact on publicly sponsored healthcare programs  however it is too early to determine to what extent  if any  these actions will impact the programs in the states in which we operate 
we can make no assurance that these actions will be favorable to our results of operations or financial condition in future periods 
investment income and other revenue our investment portfolio generated approximately million in pre tax income for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease is primarily a result of declining investment yields over the period due to changes in interest rates in the current economic recession 
we anticipate that interest rates will remain at or below the current rates as of december  for the foreseeable future which would result in reduced returns on our investment portfolio 
the performance of our portfolio is interest rate driven  and consequently  changes in interest rates affects our investment returns on  and the market value of our portfolio 
this factor or any further disruptions in the credit markets could materially adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity in future periods 
other revenue of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulted primarily from our aso contract in west tennessee 
this contract terminated on october  operating costs health benefits expenses expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december   increased million  or  to billion compared to billion for the year ended december  however  our hbr decreased to for the year ended december  versus for the prior year 
the decrease in hbr was primarily as a result of retroactive premium rate adjustments in tennessee and georgia totaling approximately million in addition to premium rate increases and yield increases resulting from membership mix changes in other markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the increase in sg a ratio was primarily a result of an increase in experience rebate expense in texas due to favorable results in that market 
the increase in sg a expenses is a result of the increase in this expense as well as increases in salaries and benefits primarily due to wage rate increases  increase in employee healthcare benefit expenses and increased earnings based compensation as a result of favorable operating performance in qui tam litigation settlement on august   we finalized the settlement of qui tam litigation relating to certain marketing practices of our former illinois health plan for a cash payment of million without any admission of wrongdoing by the company or its subsidiaries or affiliates 
we also paid approximately million to the relator for legal fees 
both payments were made during the three months ended september  as a result  we recorded a one time expense in the amount of million in the year ended december  and reported a net loss 
net of the related tax benefit  our earnings were reduced million or per diluted share 

table of contents opportunities for future membership growth new mexico on august   our new mexico subsidiary  amerigroup new mexico  inc  began serving individuals in new mexico s new colts program in six counties in the metro central region bernalillo  sandoval  torrance  valencia  santa fe and los alamos 
in november  the second phase of membership expanded coverage to include the southwest region 
the remaining regions will phase in during  ultimately expanding coverage statewide 
we were one of two organizations chosen to participate in new mexico s colts program that will provide coverage to approximately  members statewide upon completion of the program roll out 
as of december   we served approximately  members in new mexico 
the colts program is designed to coordinate long term care for individuals by bringing together a full range of healthcare services  from highly specialized hospital and institutional care to community based support services that currently are fragmented and may not be easily available to those who need them 
populations enrolled in this program include the disabled and elderly waiver program  medicaid personal care option program  residents of nursing facilities  dual eligible beneficiaries who have not yet accessed the system of long term services in the state  and certain qualified individuals with brain injuries 
as a statewide mandatory program  colts encompasses rural and native american communities  as well as the state s urban population 
a joint endeavor by the new mexico department of aging and long term care services and the department of human services  colts is designed to empower individual consumers of healthcare and to produce long term cost savings 
nevada on february   our nevada subsidiary  amerigroup nevada  inc  began serving approximately  tanf and chip members under a contract to provide medicaid managed care services through june  we are one of two organizations that together contract to provide managed care services to approximately  members across the urban washoe and urban clark county service areas 
we can make no assurance that our entry into these markets will be favorable to our results of operations or financial condition in future periods 
business strategy a significant portion of our current membership has resulted from acquisitions 
we periodically evaluate acquisition opportunities to determine if they align with our business strategy 
we continue to believe acquisitions can be an important part of our long term growth strategy 
we also have a disciplined approach to evaluating the operating performance of our existing markets to determine whether to exit or continue operating in each market 
as a result  in the past we have and may in the future decide to exit certain markets if they do not align with our long term business goals 
other market updates south carolina in november  we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of amerigroup community care of south carolina  inc this transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of amerigroup community care of south carolina  inc  served approximately  members in south carolina as of december  west tennessee our aso arrangement for the west tennessee region terminated on october  pursuant to its terms 
however  we have certain claims run out and transition obligations that will continue into additionally  we received a purchase price adjustment that reduced the purchase price by million for early termination of the aso contract which was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
the resulting goodwill of million  or per diluted share net of the related income tax effect for the year ended december   was written off to selling

accordingly  its contract with the district of columbia  as amended  terminated on june  as a result of exiting this market  we have written off acquired goodwill of million or per diluted share  net of the related income tax effect as of the year ended december  additional costs recorded and to be recorded to discontinue operations are not material 
contingencies item legal proceedings purchase agreement litigation on november   amerigroup new jersey  inc  entered into an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement with centene corporation centene and its wholly owned subsidiary university health plans  inc uhp  whereby amerigroup new jersey  inc  would purchase certain assets of uhp related to its medicaid business  including the right to serve uhp s members who are beneficiaries of the new jersey medicaid program 
prior to the execution of the purchase agreement  the state of new jersey announced that it would begin using periodic risk scores to establish the premium rates to be paid to managed care organizations with respect to their tanf and chip medicaid members effective as of january  prior to the execution of the purchase agreement  the state had neither disclosed its methodology for calculating the periodic risk score for tanf and chip beneficiaries applicable to each managed care organization nor the date on which the periodic rate scores would be announced 
following execution of the purchase agreement but prior to closing  the state notified uhp of a its final periodic risk score for its tanf and chip medicaid members  and b the amount of the corresponding premium rate reduction effective january  upon learning of uhp s final periodic risk score and the amount of the rate reduction  amerigroup new jersey  inc  notified centene and uhp in writing that i the rate reduction constituted a material adverse effect  as defined in the purchase agreement  ii the occurrence of a material adverse effect was a breach of the representations and warranties of centene and uhp in the purchase agreement  iii the absence of any material adverse effect was a precondition to the obligation of amerigroup new jersey  inc to proceed to closing under the purchase agreement  and iv pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  centene and uhp had ten days to cure the breach or amerigroup new jersey  inc  would terminate the purchase agreement in accordance with its terms 
centene and uhp failed to cure the breach within the ten day period  and  on december   amerigroup new jersey  inc notified centene and uhp in writing that the purchase agreement was terminated 
on january   centene and uhp filed a civil action complaint the complaint against amerigroup new jersey  inc and the company in the superior court of new jersey  essex county  chancery division  docket no 
c the complaint asserts breach of contract and tortious interference with contractual relations claims against amerigroup new jersey  inc and the company 
the complaint seeks specific performance compelling amerigroup new jersey  inc to perform its obligations under the purchase agreement  consequential and incidental damages to be determined at trial  and other relief as the court may deem just and proper 
on february   the company and amerigroup new jersey  inc filed a motion for partial dismissal of the complaint and to transfer venue  seeking the dismissal of the tortious interference claims against both the company and amerigroup new jersey  inc  and the transfer of venue of the remaining cause of action in the complaint from the superior court of new jersey  essex county  to the superior court of new jersey  middlesex county  the latter being the location of the executive offices of both amerigroup new jersey  inc and uhp 

table of contents the company and amerigroup new jersey  inc believe that they have substantial defenses to these claims and will defend against them vigorously 
while the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe the final outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
risk sharing receivable amerigroup texas  inc previously had an exclusive risk sharing arrangement in the fort worth service area with cook children s health care network cchcn and cook children s physician network ccpn  which includes cook children s medical center ccmc  that expired by its own terms as of august  under this risk sharing arrangement the parties had an obligation to perform annual reconciliations and settlements of the risk pool for each contract year 
the contract with cchcn prescribes reconciliation procedures all of which have been completed 
cchcn subsequently engaged external consultants to review all medical claim payments made for the contract year and the preliminary results challenged payments made on certain claims 
the parties participated in voluntary non binding mediation but were unable to resolve this matter 
following the conclusion of the mediation  on august   amerigroup texas  inc filed suit against cchcn and ccpn in the district court for the rd judicial district in tarrant county  texas  case no 
 alleging breach of contract and seeking compensatory damages in the amount of million plus pre and post judgment interest and attorney s fees and costs 
on october   cchcn and ccpn filed a counterclaim against amerigroup texas  inc alleging breach of contract and seeking an amount to be determined at trial plus pre and post judgment interest and attorney s fees and costs 
a trial is set for september  and the parties are currently engaged in discovery 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   includes a receivable balance related to this issue 
we believe that the amount at issue is a valid receivable and that we have a favorable legal position with respect to the above described litigation 
however  we may incur significant costs in our efforts to reach a final resolution of this matter 
further  in the event that we are unable to resolve this matter in a favorable manner or obtain an outcome at trial resulting in payment in full to us  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
other litigation additionally  we are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
based upon our evaluation of the information currently available  we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect  either individually or in the aggregate  on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be significant 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums and aso fees we receive from the states in which we operate to arrange for healthcare services for our tanf  chip  abd and familycare members 
we receive premiums from cms for our medicare advantage members 
we recognize premium and aso fee revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
a fixed amount per member per month is paid to us to arrange for healthcare services for our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets 
these premium 
table of contents payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government agencies with whom we contract 
errors in this eligibility determination on which we rely can result in positive and negative revenue adjustments to the extent this information is adjusted by the state 
adjustments to eligibility data received from these government agencies result from retroactive application of enrollment or disenrollment of members or classification changes of members between rate categories that were not known by us in previous months due to timing of the receipt of data or errors in processing by the government agencies 
these changes  while common  are not generally large 
retroactive adjustments to revenue for corrections in eligibility data are recorded in the period in which the information becomes known 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly  if appropriate 
historically  the impact of these adjustments has represented less than of annual revenue  which results in a negligible impact on annual earnings as changes in revenue are typically accompanied by corresponding changes in the related health benefits expense 
we believe this historical experience represents what is reasonably likely to occur in future periods 
in all of the states in which we operate  except new mexico  tennessee and virginia  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments to offset the health benefits expenses associated with the birth of a baby 
each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are collectible 
upon delivery of a baby  each state is notified according to our contract 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member based on our authorization system for these services 
changes in authorization and claims data used to estimate supplemental revenues can occur as a result of changes in eligibility noted above or corrections of errors in the underlying data 
adjustments to revenue for corrections to authorization and claims data are recorded in the period in which the corrections become known 
historically  the impact of these adjustments has represented less than of annual revenue  which results in a negligible impact on annual earnings as changes in revenue are typically accompanied by corresponding changes in the related health benefits expense 
we believe this historical experience represents what is reasonably likely to occur in future periods 
estimating health benefits expense and claims payable the most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable 
at december   this liability was million and represented of our total consolidated liabilities 
included in this liability and the corresponding health benefits expenses for ibnr claims are the estimated costs of processing such claims 
health benefits expenses have two main components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratories and pharmacies 
medically related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management  utilization review services  quality assurance and on call nurses 
we have used a consistent methodology for estimating our medical expenses and medical claims payable since inception  and have refined our assumptions to take into account our maturing claims  product and market experience 
our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards 
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient  or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate 
therefore  in many situations  the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
in developing our medical claims payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for mature incurred months generally the months prior to the most recent three months  we calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the date of estimation 
we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 

table of contents we do not believe that completion factors are fully credible for estimating claims incurred for the most recent two to three months which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical claims payable 
accordingly  we estimate health benefits expenses incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in a more complete time period 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available 
the average pmpm is also adjusted for known changes in hospital authorization data  provider contracting changes  changes in benefit levels  age and gender mix of members  and seasonality 
the incurred estimates resulting from the analysis of completion factors  medical cost trend factors and other known changes are weighted together using actuarial judgment 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable with consistency 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state such as cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and growth of our members in our assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated  as opposed to a fee for service  basis 
these considerations are aggregated in the medical cost trend 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately establish estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of health benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical claims payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical claims payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factor increase decrease in increase decrease in factor medical claims payable in millions reflects estimated potential changes in health benefits expenses and medical claims payable caused by changes in completion factors used in developing medical claims payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical claims payable for the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical claims payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december  medical cost pmpm trend increase decrease in increase decrease in factor medical claims payable in millions 
table of contents reflects estimated potential changes in health benefits expenses and medical claims payable caused by changes in medical costs pmpm trend data used in developing medical claims payable estimates for the most recent three months 
the analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on the company s historical experience in estimating its medical claims payable 
changes in estimates of medical claims payable are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submission and our payment processes results in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experienced medical cost trend 
deviations  whether positive or negative  between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability are recorded in the period known 
we continually monitor and adjust the medical claims payable and health benefits expense based on subsequent paid claims activity 
if it is determined that our assumptions regarding medical cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results  our results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be impacted in future periods 
adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional health benefits expense or a reduction of health benefits expense in the period an adjustment is made 
further  due to the considerable variability of healthcare costs  adjustments to medical claims payable occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter 
prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuaries judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued 
the following table presents the components of the change in medical claims payable for the three years ended december in thousands medical claims payable as of january health benefits expenses incurred during the year related to current year related to prior years total incurred health benefits payments during the year related to current year related to prior years total payments medical claims payable as of december current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year health benefits expenses incurred health benefits expenses incurred related to prior years as a percent of prior year medical claims payable as of december health benefits expenses incurred related to prior years as a percent of the prior year s health benefits expenses related to current year health benefits expenses incurred during the year  was reduced by approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  for amounts related to prior years 
as noted above  the actuarial standards of practice generally require that the liabilities established for ibnr be sufficient to 
table of contents cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
we did not experience moderately adverse conditions in either period 
therefore included in the amounts related to prior years are approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to amounts included in the medical claims payable as of january of each respective year in order to establish the liability at a level adequate for moderately adverse conditions 
the increase in the absolute dollar value of this estimate for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   is due to the increased value of the medical claims payable on which this assumption is applied 
the remaining reduction in health benefits expenses incurred during the year  related to prior years  of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily resulted from obtaining more complete claims information for claims incurred for dates of service in the prior years 
we refer to these amounts as net reserve development 
claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits in and related to prior year dates of services for both periods 
these recoveries also caused our actuarial estimates to include faster completion factors than were originally established 
the faster completion factors account for the remaining net favorable reserve development in each respective period 
health benefits expenses incurred during the year  related to prior years  for the year ended december  was approximately million which includes approximately million that was included in the medical claims payable as of january  in order to establish the liability at a level adequate for moderately adverse conditions 
we did not experience moderately adverse conditions 
the remaining reduction in health benefits expenses incurred during the year  related to prior years  of approximately million was due to cost trends not remaining at elevated levels as previously anticipated 
establishing the liabilities for ibnr  associated with health benefits expenses incurred during a year  related to that current year  at a level sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions will cause incurred health benefits expenses for that current year to be higher than if ibnr was established without sufficiency for moderately adverse conditions 
in the above table  the health benefits expenses incurred during the year related to the current year include an assumption to cover moderately adverse conditions 
also included in medical claims payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement and claims payment differences  as well as amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
premium deficiency reserves in addition to incurred but not paid claims  the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies  if appropriate 
premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums and investment income on existing medical insurance contracts 
for purposes of premium deficiencies  contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring  servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts 
we did not have any premium deficiency reserves at december  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability based on enacted tax rates  estimates of book to tax differences in income  and projections of income that will be earned in each taxing jurisdiction 
deferred tax assets and liabilities representing the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting net income and taxable income are measured at the tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded 
after tax returns for the applicable year are filed  the estimated tax liability is adjusted to the actual liability per the filed federal and state tax returns 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates of tax liability and our actual tax liability 
similar to other companies  we sometimes face challenges from the tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
positions taken on our tax returns are evaluated and benefits are recognized only if it is more likely than 
table of contents not that our position will be sustained on audit 
based on our evaluation of tax positions  we believe that we have appropriately accounted for potential tax exposures 
in addition  we are periodically audited by federal and state taxing authorities and these audits can result in proposed assessments 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and  as such  will vigorously defend these positions on audit 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
although the ultimate resolution of these audits may require additional tax payments  we do not anticipate any material impact to earnings 
the qui tam litigation settlement payment had a significant impact on tax expense and the effective tax rate for due to the fact that a portion of the settlement payment is not deductible for income tax purposes 
at december   the estimated tax benefit associated with the qui tam settlement payment was approximately million 
the company has requested a pre filing agreement with the irs regarding the tax treatment of the qui tam settlement 
as the company works to resolve this issue with the irs  it is possible that there will be changes to the tax benefit associated with the qui tam settlement that will have a material impact on income tax expense and the effective tax rate in future accounting periods 
for further information  please reference note to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  included in this form k 
goodwill and intangible assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at acquisition requires assumptions regarding estimated discounted cash flows and market analyses 
these assumptions contain uncertainties because they require management to use judgment in selecting the assumptions and applying the market analyses to the individual acquisitions 
additionally  impairment evaluations require management to use judgment to determine if impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is apparent 
we have applied a consistent methodology in both the original valuation and subsequent impairment evaluations for all goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions occurring since the adoption of fasb statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we do not anticipate any changes to that methodology  nor has any impairment loss resulted from our analyses other than that recognized in connection with discontinued operations in west tennessee and the district of columbia as noted above 
if the assumptions used to evaluate the value of goodwill and intangible assets change in the future  an impairment loss may be recorded and it could be material to our results of operations in the period in which the impairment loss occurs 
recent accounting standards on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
this interpretation provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for a tax benefit to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by applicable taxing authorities 
the benefit recognized is the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon final settlement of the tax position 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the adoption of fin  we recorded a million increase to retained earnings as of january  in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fasb statement no 

fasb statement no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company has adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
as of january   for financial instruments 
although the adoption of fasb statement no 
did not materially impact our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flow  the company is now required to provide additional disclosures as part of its financial statements 
fasb statement no 
establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active 
table of contents markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of fasb statement no 
in an inactive market and illustrates how an entity would determine fair value when the market for a financial asset is not active 
the company s assumptions underlying our adoption of fasb statement no 
were not materially impacted by the provisions of fsp fasb staff position fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  delays the effective date of fasb statement no 
until fiscal years beginning after november  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis which would include the following initial measurement of employee termination benefits incurred  initial measurement of intangible assets acquired in business combinations  and measurement of long lived assets upon recognition of an impairment charge 
we did not have any material transactions related to these types of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to which the provisions of fasb statement no 
would apply during the year ended december  additionally  the provisions of fasb statement no 
were not applied to fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
on january   the company will be required to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
to fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  of applying these provisions on its financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
fsp apb a requires the proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount will be amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
fsp apb a is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is applied retrospectively to prior periods 
fsp apb a will change the accounting treatment for our million convertible senior notes due may   which were issued effective march  the impact of this new accounting treatment will be significant to our results of operations and will result in an increase to non cash interest expense beginning in for financial statements covering past and future periods 
we estimate that our  and reported earnings per diluted share will decrease by approximately  and  respectively  as a result of the adoption of fsp apb a 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations fasb statement no 
r 
fasb statement no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer determines and recognizes in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
fasb statement no 
r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination

revenues premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or

total membership increased to  as of december  from  as of december  the following table sets forth the approximate number of our members in each state as of december   and because we receive two premiums for members that are in both the medicare advantage and abd products  these members have been counted twice in the states where we offer these plans

this decrease resulted primarily from our conclusion of the aso contract in west tennessee effective october   under which we provided aso services to approximately  members as of december  our risk membership increased to  as of december  compared to  as of december   or 
this increase is primarily a result of growth in our florida  maryland and south carolina markets all of which benefited from growth in the eligible populations through program expansion in each state 
additionally  our entry into the new mexico market through the medicare advantage plan in january and the colts program in august contributed to our increase in risk membership 
our investment portfolio generated approximately million in pre tax income for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease is primarily a result of declining investment yields 
other revenue of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulted primarily from our aso contract in west tennessee

table of contents health benefits expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or 
the hbr for the year ended december  was compared to in the decrease in hbr was primarily as a result of retroactive premium rate adjustments in tennessee and georgia totaling approximately million in addition to premium rate increases and yield increases in our other markets 
expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or 
the hbr for the year ended december  was compared to in our results compared to reflect an increase in the hbr primarily as a result of a higher proportion of our business in developing markets 
these developing markets which include georgia  tennessee  ohio abd  and texas abd as well as maryland medicare advantage  all as of december  generally have a higher hbr than our mature markets due to the introduction of managed care into a previously unmanaged population and the associated start up period required to identify and implement appropriate care management and disease management strategies for the population 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses sg a increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in the increase in sg a ratio is primarily a result of an increase in experience rebate expense in texas due to favorable results in that market 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits primarily due to wage rate increases  increases in employee healthcare benefit expenses  and increased earnings based compensation as a result of favorable operating performance  an increase in experience rebate expense in texas due to favorable results in that market  and the write off of goodwill related to our market exits in west tennessee and the district of columbia 
sg a increased million for the year ended december  compared to our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in the decrease in sg a ratio is primarily a result of leverage gained through increased revenue 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to a growth in salaries and benefits expenses due to a increase in the number of employees  an increase in premium taxes from revenue growth in markets where the tax is levied  and an increase in experience rebate expense in texas driven by two factors an accrual of million associated with the resolution of audit items on all open experience rebate reports for prior years  and the experience rebate expense associated with the favorable operational performance in the state 
premium taxes were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in premium tax expense in compared to is a result of our entry into new mexico in august and growth in premium revenues in the markets where premium tax is levied 
the increase in premium tax expense in compared to is due to our entry into the georgia and tennessee markets in depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to is a result of an increase in fixed assets and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to significant principal payments in the increase from to was a result of greater depreciable assets  the write off of debt issuance costs related to the termination of the company s previous million credit agreement and an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the new credit agreement entered into in march 
table of contents interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to is a result of decreased interest rates compared to prior year and principal payments on outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement reducing the balance on which interest was paid 
the company entered into and borrowed under the credit agreement and issued convertible senior notes in causing the significant increase in interest expense in compared to provision for income taxes income tax expense for and was million and million  respectively  with an effective tax rate of in and in the primary driver of the difference in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  is the fact that a portion of the settlement payment in connection with qui tam litigation is not deductible for income tax purposes 
the estimated tax benefit related to the non recurring qui tam litigation settlement payment was approximately million 
income tax expense for was million with an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in effective tax rate from to is primarily a result of the decrease in the blended state income tax rate 
net income loss net loss for was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in net income for was million or per diluted share 
net income decreased from to primarily as a result of the one time expense recorded in connection with the settlement of the qui tam litigation equal to million or million  net of the related tax benefit 
the impact of this one time expense was mitigated in part by a lower health benefits ratio due to retroactive premium adjustments 
net income increased from to as a result of growth in total revenues associated with geographic expansion  membership increases  premium rate increases and investment income increases limiting the increase in hbr  and reducing sg a as a percentage of revenues 
income statement reclassifications in  the company will make certain reclassifications to its income statement format 
beginning in the first quarter of  the company will remove the texas experience rebate expense from selling  general and administrative expenses and include the amount as a reduction to premium revenue  as this amount is effectively a premium rebate to the state 
in addition  premium tax expense will be reported on a separate line following selling  general and administrative expenses and before depreciation and amortization expense 
the change will have the effect of increasing our health benefits ratio and reducing our selling  general and administrative expense ratio 
liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity 
we forecast  analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short and long term investments of million and restricted investments on deposit for licensure of million 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments which are unrestricted and unregulated totaled million at december  we believe that existing cash and investment balances  cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement will be sufficient to support our continuing operations  capital expenditures 
table of contents and our growth strategy for at least months 
our debt to total capital ratio at december  was 
the financial markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
in the event we need access to additional capital  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significantly higher than in past periods 
while we have not attempted to access the credit markets recently  we believe that if credit could be obtained  the terms and costs of such credit would be significantly less favorable to us than what was obtained in our most recent financings 
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
this could restrict our ability to acquire new businesses or enter new markets  service our existing debt  make necessary capital investments  maintain statutory net worth requirements in the states in which we do business  and make other expenditures necessary for the ongoing conduct of our business 
our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos  one hic and one phsp 
hmos  hics and phsps are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their stockholders 
additionally  certain state regulatory agencies may require individual regulated entities to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries were in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
we anticipate the parent company may be required to fund minimum net worth shortfalls during using unregulated cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe as a result that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through the end of the national association of insurance commissioners naic has defined risk based capital rbc standards for hmos and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage that are designed to measure capitalization levels by comparing each company s adjusted surplus to its required surplus rbc ratio 
the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of hmos 
within certain ratio ranges  regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases 
there are four levels of regulatory action  ranging from requiring insurers to submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control 
eight of our eleven states have adopted rbc as the measure of required surplus 
at december   our consolidated rbc ratio for these states is estimated to be over which compares to the required level of  or the company action level 
in the remaining states  we have approximately three times the state required surplus level 
although not all states had adopted these rules at december   at that date  each of the company s active health plans had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or  where adopted  the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic s rbc rules 
financing activities credit agreement our credit agreement provides both a secured term loan and a secured senior revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the term loan portion of our credit agreement 
the credit agreement terminates on march  during  the company paid million in scheduled and voluntary principal payments of outstanding balances under the credit agreement 
the company elected to make voluntary payments of principal as a result of cash received from the release of restricted investments held as collateral in excess of the amount needed to fund the qui tam litigation settlement 
additionally  the company purchased in the open market and retired approximately million of its outstanding principal on the term loan at approximately of par resulting in a gain of million for the year ended december  our credit agreement also provides for up to million of financing under a senior secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility portion of 
table of contents our credit agreement  but have caused to be issued irrevocable letters of credit in the aggregate face amount of million 
the borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at our option at a percentage  per annum  equal to the adjusted eurodollar rate plus or the base rate plus 
we are required to make payments of interest in arrears on each interest payment date to be determined depending on interest period elections made by the company and at maturity of the loans  including final maturity thereof 
the applicable interest rate was at december  the credit agreement includes customary covenants and events of default 
if any event of default occurs and is continuing  the credit agreement may be terminated and all amounts owing there under may become immediately due and payable 
the credit agreement also includes the following financial covenants i maximum leverage ratios as of specified periods  ii a minimum interest coverage ratio and iii a minimum statutory net worth ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  php holdings  inc  including a pledge of the stock of each of our respective wholly owned managed care subsidiaries  in each case  subject to carve outs 
convertible senior notes as of december   we had outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due may  in may  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s with the sec covering the resale of the convertible senior notes and common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible senior notes 
the convertible senior notes are governed by an indenture dated as of march  the indenture 
the convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt and senior to all of our subordinated debt 
the convertible senior notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries and to any existing and future secured indebtedness  including the obligations under our credit agreement 
the convertible senior notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semiannually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year  beginning on may  the convertible senior notes mature on may   unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with the indenture 
upon conversion of the convertible senior notes  we will pay cash up to the principal amount of the convertible senior notes converted 
with respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes converted  we have the option to settle the excess with cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock based on a daily conversion value  as defined in the indenture 
if an accounting event as defined in the indenture occurs  we have the option to elect to settle the converted notes exclusively in shares of our common stock 
the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes will be shares of common stock per one thousand dollars of principal amount of convertible senior notes  which represents a conversion premium based on the closing price of per share of our common stock on march  and is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest 
in addition  if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs prior to the maturity date  we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder of notes that elects to convert its notes in connection with such fundamental change 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we purchased convertible note hedges covering  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments   shares of our common stock 
the convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and or cash equal to the amounts of common stock and or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the notes upon conversion 
these convertible note hedges will terminate at the earlier of the maturity dates of the notes or the first day on which none of the notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 

table of contents the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the convertible note hedges  at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedges  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the notes and is subject to certain customary adjustments 
if  however  the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants discussed below when such warrants are exercised  we will be required to issue common stock 
both the convertible note hedges and warrants provide for net share settlement at the time of any exercise for the amount that the market value of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price 
also concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we sold warrants to acquire  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
if the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the settlement date exceeds the exercise price of the warrants  the warrants will be settled  at our option  in cash or shares of our common stock 
the convertible note hedges and warrants are separate transactions which will not affect holders rights under the notes 
universal automatic shelf registration on december   we filed a universal automatic shelf registration statement with the sec which enables the company to sell  in one or more public offerings  common stock  preferred stock and debt securities and other securities at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of the applicable offering 
the shelf registration provides us with the flexibility to publicly offer and sell securities at times it believe market conditions make such an offering attractive 
because we are a well known seasoned issuer  the shelf registration statement was effective upon filing 
no securities have been issued under the shelf registration 
stock repurchase program in  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program and authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares  subject to limits imposed by our credit agreement and otherwise 
pursuant to this share repurchase program  we repurchased  shares of our common stock and placed them into treasury during the year ended december  for a total cost of approximately million 
as of december   the company s share repurchase program had approximately million shares remaining under the limit authorized to be repurchased 
in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional three million shares under the program 
cash and investments cash from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash from operations is primarily a result of a decrease in net income as a result of the qui tam litigation settlement recorded and paid in additionally  cash flows from operations decreased due to a decrease in cash flows provided by changes in working capital of million 
this decrease was primarily a result of an increase in claims payable in as a result of the entry into tennessee in with no comparable increase in and differences in the timing of tax payments year over year 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  this increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily a result of net purchases of restricted investments in subsequently released in additionally  the company executed net purchases of hedge and warrant instruments in that did not recur in we currently anticipate total capital expenditures for of approximately million to million related to technological infrastructure development and the expansion of our medical management system 
our investment policies are designed to preserve capital  provide liquidity and maximize total return on invested assets 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
the weighted average maturity is approximately eight months excluding our auction rate securities which are 
table of contents discussed below 
we utilize investment vehicles such as money market funds  commercial paper  municipal bonds  debt securities of government sponsored entities  corporate bonds  auction rate securities and us treasury instruments 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their funds 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield on consolidated investments as of december  was approximately 
as of december   we had total cash and investments of billion 
approximately of our investment portfolio was invested in a diversified array of money market funds 
approximately of our portfolio was invested in debt obligations of government sponsored entities  us treasuries  or fdic backed corporate bonds  all of which carried an aaa credit rating 
approximately of our portfolio was invested in investment grade corporate bonds with a weighted average credit rating of aa and approximately of our portfolio is in long term municipal student loan corporation auction rate securities that carried a weighted average credit rating of aaa 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
effective january  we have determined that we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of certain auction rate securities totaling million at december  as of december   million of our investments were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes were issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities 
all of these securities carry at least an a credit rating with the majority carrying a aaa credit rating 
liquidity for these auction rate securities was historically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes and the interest rate was resets at pre determined intervals  usually every or days 
since early  auctions for these auction rate securities have failed and there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will succeed in the future 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
as we cannot predict the timing of future successful auctions  if any  auction rate securities totaling million are classified as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements as of december  our auction rate securities are classified as either available for sale or trading securities and reflected at fair value 
in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would qualify as level under fasb statement no 
however  the auction events for these securities failed during early and have not resumed 
therefore  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model as of december  these analyses consider  among other items  the creditworthiness of the issuer  the timing of the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and an assumption of when the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable and relevant market data which is limited at this time 
due to these events  we reclassified these instruments as level during and recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of approximately million  with a corresponding increase to other comprehensive loss of approximately million which is net of the related tax benefit 
we currently believe that this temporary decline in fair value is primarily due to liquidity concerns  because the underlying assets for the majority of these securities are student loans supported and guaranteed by the united states department of education 
in addition  our holdings of auction rate securities represented less than five percent of our total cash  cash equivalent  and investment balance at december   which we believe allows us sufficient time for the securities to return to full value 
because we believe that the current decline in fair value is temporary and based primarily on liquidity issues in the credit markets  any difference between our estimate and an estimate that would be arrived at by another party would have no impact on our earnings  since such difference would also be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we will re evaluate each of these factors as market conditions change in subsequent periods 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we were notified by several of our brokers from whom we purchased auction rate securities that they would be repurchasing those securities over the course of and we entered into a forward contract with one of these brokers in accordance with its terms for auction rate securities totaling million as of december   at no cost to the company 
this forward contract provides the company with the ability to sell these auction rate securities to the broker at par within a defined timeframe 
as a result of this transaction  these securities have been reclassified to trading because the company no longer intends to hold these securities until final maturity 
trading securities are carried at fair value 
changes in fair value are recorded in earnings 
as of december   a realized loss of million was recorded related to these trading securities 
additionally  the value of the forward contract of million was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis taking into consideration the creditworthiness of the counterparty to the agreement 
this forward contract was recognized as of december  at its estimated fair value and is included in other long term assets with a corresponding increase to earnings 
the weighted average life of our auction rate securities portfolio  based on the final maturity  is approximately years 
we currently have the ability to hold our auction rate securities to maturity  if required  or if and when market stability is restored with respect to these investments 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to repayments on the credit agreement of million and stock repurchases of million in compared to net proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible senior notes and borrowings under our credit agreement in contractual obligations the following table summarizes our material contractual obligations  including both on and off balance sheet arrangements  and our commitments at december  in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations operating lease obligations 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under non cancelable office space leases 
long term obligations 
long term obligations include amounts payable under our credit agreement which terminates march  and our convertible senior notes which mature may  off balance sheet arrangements we have no investments  loans or any other known contractual arrangements with special purpose entities  variable interest entities or financial partnerships 
as of the year ended december   the company has caused an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued under our credit agreement in the amount of million for the benefit of the state of georgia department of community health in compliance with requirements of the georgia medicaid contract 
commitments as of december   the company has no commitments 
inflation although healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to reduce the negative effects of healthcare 
table of contents cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our consolidated financial statements include a certain amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risk 
due to our significant investment in fixed maturity investments  interest rate risk represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
in addition  the credit markets have experienced significant disruptions during the year 
liquidity on many financial instruments has declined  the creditworthiness of many issuers have declined  defaults have increased  along with other disruptions 
while we do not believe we have experienced material adverse changes in the value of our cash  cash equivalents and investments  further disruptions could impact the value of these assets and other financial assets we may hold in the future 
there can be no assurance that future changes in interest rates  creditworthiness of issuers  prepayment activity  liquidity available in the market and other general market conditions will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
as of december   substantially all of our investments were in high quality securities that have historically exhibited good liquidity which include us treasuries  debt securities of government sponsored entities  municipal bonds  commercial paper  auction rate securities  corporate bonds and money market funds 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments as defined by fasb statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fair value of the fixed maturity investment portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk the risk of loss in fair value resulting from changes in prevailing market rates of interest for similar financial instruments 
however  we have the ability to hold fixed maturity investments to maturity 
we rely on the experience and judgment of senior management to monitor and mitigate the effects of market risk 
the allocation among various types of securities is adjusted from time to time based on market conditions  credit conditions  tax policy  fluctuations in interest rates and other factors 
in addition  we place the majority of our investments in high quality  liquid securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as of december   an increase of in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would have reduced the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would have increased the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
the above changes in fair value are impacted by securities in our portfolio that have a call provision feature 
in a decreasing rate environment  these instruments may not see as significant a potential for fair value increases as non callable instruments due to the expectation that the issuer will call the instrument to take advantage of lower rates 
we believe this fair value presentation is indicative of our market risk because it evaluates each investment based on its individual characteristics 
consequently  the fair value presentation does not assume that each investment reacts identically based on a change in interest rates
