overview dolby laboratories develops and delivers innovative products and technologies that are used throughout the entertainment industry to produce a more immersive and enjoyable experience 
over the years  dolby has introduced innovations that have significantly improved audio entertainment  such as noise reduction for the recording and cinema industries and surround sound for cinema and home entertainment 
as a result of these innovations  we believe the dolby brand has come to symbolize a superior entertainment experience 
today  dolby technologies are standard in a wide range of entertainment platforms 
our technologies are used in virtually all standard definition digital versatile disc  or dvd  players and personal computer dvd playback software  increasingly in digital televisions  set top boxes  portable media devices and in a wide array of consumer electronic products such as gaming systems and audio video receivers 
movie theatres and broadcasters around the world use dolby s products 
we believe our success in innovating comes as the result of a comprehensive approach to improving the entertainment experience 
we focus on developing solutions for use throughout the entertainment industry  including content creation  distribution and playback 
success across these different markets has led to a large ecosystem of both content and devices that incorporate our technologies  and consequently  many households have several devices containing dolby technologies 
we are a global organization that generates revenue by licensing our technologies to manufacturers of consumer electronics products and media software vendors  and selling our professional products and related services to entertainment content creators  producers and distributors 
we have licensed our technologies to manufacturers in approximately countries and our licensees distribute products incorporating our technologies throughout the world 
we sell our products and services in over countries 
in fiscal  and  revenue from outside the united states was  and of our total revenue  respectively 
geographical data for our licensing  products and services revenue is based on the location of the corporate headquarters of the licensee  the location where the products are shipped or where the services are performed  respectively 

table of contents opportunities  challenges and risks macroeconomic conditions have reduced consumer demand in the markets in which we license and sell products 
our business is exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions because products that incorporate our technologies are entertainment oriented and generally discretionary goods  such as dvd players  blu ray disc players  dvd recorders  personal computers  digital televisions  mobile devices  video game consoles  set top boxes  home theaters in a box  camcorders  portable media devices  audio video receivers and in car entertainment systems 
our fiscal revenue was affected by general economic weakness 
the slowdown in consumer spending resulted in a lower number of pcs sold with our technologies compared to a year ago and a continued decline in sales of standard definition dvd players compared to a year ago 
however  our licensing revenue in fiscal grew when compared to fiscal primarily due to increased shipments of set top boxes with our technologies  including national telecommunications and information administration ntia converter boxes and digital transport adapters dta devices  in the us  an increase in the number of digital televisions in europe and asia that incorporate our technologies and an increase in the number of mobile devices worldwide that incorporate he aac technology 
licensing revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue  representing  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we categorize our licensing revenue into the following markets personal computer pc market revenue primarily attributable to software dvd players  microsoft windows vista home premium and ultimate editions as well as the pc entertainment experience 
broadcast market primarily comprised of televisions and set top boxes 
consumer electronics ce market primarily comprised of dvd players and recorders  camcorders  blu ray disc players  audio video receivers and home theaters in a box 
mobile market comprised of mobile devices 
gaming market primarily comprised of video game consoles 
automotive market comprised of in car entertainment systems 
licensing services revenue from the administration of joint licensing programs 
our personal computer market  which represented approximately of our licensing revenue in fiscal  just over in fiscal and approximately in fiscal  has been primarily driven by the inclusion of our technologies in media applications or operating systems that are often included in personal computer shipments 
the media applications include dvd playback and or dvd authoring software made by third party software vendors and the operating systems contain playback and authoring functionality 
our pc market also includes revenue from our pc entertainment experience pcee program which is a suite of technologies for entertainment oriented pcs that enhance the audio quality of media 
microsoft includes dolby technologies in two editions of its vista operating system  vista home premium and vista ultimate  which are primarily aimed at the consumer market 
in addition  microsoft recently released its newest operating system  windows  which includes dolby technologies in four of the six available editions 
dolby technologies  including dolby s next generation audio codec dolby digital plus  are included in the windows home premium and ultimate editions as well as the windows professional and enterprise editions 
almost half of the world s personal computer shipments are to the business market  and therefore the adoption of dolby technologies in the professional and enterprise editions increases the potential for dolby to receive royalties on a greater percentage of personal computer shipments 
there are several uncertainties associated with the windows opportunity 
the inclusion of our technologies in windows professional and enterprise editions could result in our technologies residing in a greater percentage of pcs shipped than in the past when our technologies were only included in consumer 
table of contents editions of microsoft operating systems and in third party dvd software applications 
however  the benefit from this potential significant increase in reported units would be partially offset by substantial discounts  thereby reducing the average per unit royalty we would receive from microsoft over time 
we currently receive royalties for pcs that ship with third party dvd software applications containing our technologies 
as windows provides enhanced dvd playback and incorporates some of the functionality found in these third party software applications  we expect some pc manufacturers will exclude these applications from their offerings 
business customers may take several years to upgrade to windows given the longer adoption cycles associated with enterprise customers and the effects the current economy may have on information technology budgets 
consumers are increasingly purchasing low cost pcs  particularly netbooks 
we expect these pcs to be sold with windows starter or home basic editions  which do not contain dolby technologies 
our broadcast market  which is primarily driven by demand for dolby digital in set top boxes and televisions  represented just over of our licensing revenue in fiscal  just under in fiscal and approximately in fiscal our broadcast market has benefited from increased global shipments of set top boxes including the contribution of revenue from ntia converter boxes  dta devices and digital televisions in europe and north america that contain dolby digital 
we view the broadcast market as an area for potential growth  primarily driven by broadcast markets outside of the united states 
we also view broadcast services operating under particular bandwidth constraints  such as terrestrial broadcast or iptv services  as an area of opportunity for us to offer dolby digital plus and he aac  which are able to deliver surround sound at reduced bit rates 
notwithstanding our success in the broadcast market to date  we may not be able to capitalize on these opportunities and actual results may differ from our expectations 
our consumer electronics market  which is driven primarily by revenue attributable to sales of dvd players  represented just under of licensing revenue in fiscal  just over in fiscal and approximately in fiscal in fiscal  the decrease in the consumer electronics market as a percentage of total licensing revenue was primarily due to faster revenue growth in our other markets  mainly the broadcast and mobile markets  as well as decreased sales of standard definition dvd players 
a growth opportunity within our consumer electronics market exists with the blu ray format  as dolby digital has been selected as a mandatory audio standard  dolby digital plus has been selected as a mandatory audio standard for secondary track playback and dolby truehd has been selected as an optional audio standard in the blu ray disc format 
however  depending upon the success of the blu ray format  revenue from blu ray disc players may not offset future declines in revenue from standard definition dvd players 
revenue from our mobile market is primarily driven by demand for aac and he aac technologies  which are incorporated into mobile devices 
we view the mobile market as an area of opportunity to increase revenue  however actual results may differ from our expectations 
revenue generated from the gaming and automotive markets has primarily been driven by sales of video game consoles  portable gaming devices and in car entertainment systems with dolby digital  atrac and dolby truehd technologies 
revenue generated by our licensing services market has primarily been driven by demand for mpeg audio and mpeg audio technologies used in portable media devices 
we have also introduced new technologies for the broadcast  consumer electronics and gaming markets  including dolby volume  dynamic range image technologies and dolby axon 
dolby volume is a sound leveling technology that performs measurement and analysis of signals according to a model based on the characteristics of human hearing  in order to provide consistent volume and quality across various programs 
our dynamic range imaging technologies include dolby contrast and dolby vision 
dolby contrast provides enhanced contrast and dolby vision combines enhanced contrast with extended brightness and dynamic range  each for lcd televisions with led backlit technology 
dolby axon is a voice technology that enables online gamers to perceive other players locations  making online gaming more real and immersive 
we do not anticipate generating significant revenue from these technologies in fiscal in the mobile market  we introduced dolby mobile  which is a suite of post processing technologies optimized for mobile devices and designed to enhance the audio quality of media delivered on the device 

table of contents our technologies are incorporated in consumer electronics and digital entertainment products throughout the world 
we expect that sales of products incorporating our technologies in emerging economies  such as china and india  will increase in the future as consumers in these geographical markets have more disposable income available to purchase entertainment products  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we also expect that manufacturers from lower cost manufacturing countries  including china  will increase production of consumer electronics and digital entertainment products in the future to satisfy this increased demand 
there are risks associated with opportunities of doing business in emerging economies  such as china  that have affected and will continue to affect our operating results  such as manufacturers failing to report or underreporting product shipments 
product sales consist of revenue from sales of equipment to cinema operators and broadcasters representing  and of total revenue in fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
our cinema products represented approximately of product sales in fiscal  of product sales in fiscal and of product sales in fiscal the increase in cinema product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue was primarily due to the recognition of digital cinema product revenue as a result of achieving compliance with the digital cinema initiative dci specifications and satisfying all other revenue recognition criteria in fiscal our traditional cinema products are primarily used to read and decode a film s soundtrack  to calibrate cinema sound systems and to adapt analog cinema audio systems to digital audio formats 
our digital cinema servers load  store  decrypt and decode encrypted digital film files for presentation on a digital projector  and our digital d products provide d image capabilities 
while macroeconomic conditions have limited the availability of funding for system integrators to finance digital cinema rollouts in which we could participate  there is a trend in the cinema industry to transition to digital cinema 
digital cinema offers the motion picture industry a possible means to achieve cost savings in printing and distributing movies  to combat piracy  and to enable movies to be played repeatedly without degradation in image and audio quality 
we offer our dolby digital cinema server  which allows for the storage and playback of digital content  as well as our dolby d digital cinema technology  which delivers a d experience when combined with an exhibitor s existing digital cinema projector and server 
we expect most exhibitors constructing new theatres or upgrading existing theatres to choose digital cinema over traditional film cinema 
digital cinema is based on open standards  which unlike traditional cinema  does not include our proprietary audio formats 
we face more pricing and other competitive pressures in the digital cinema market than we have historically experienced for our traditional cinema products 
a competitor has introduced a digital cinema solution which supports the presentation of movies with higher resolution k digital cinema projectors 
certain major us exhibitors have announced their intention to outfit their theatres exclusively with k digital cinema equipment 
other exhibitors may feel that they need to outfit some or all of their theatres with k digital cinema equipment to compete in the same markets where competitors are promoting k solutions 
dolby currently does not offer a k digital cinema solution 
if we do not offer a solution that supports k presentation  our future prospects in digital cinema may be limited and our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  as the film industry is transitioning to digital cinema  the demand for our traditional cinema products and services is declining  and we anticipate that the demand for film based products will continue to decline in future periods 
our broadcast products  which represented approximately of product sales in fiscal  of product sales in fiscal and of product sales in fiscal  are used to encode  transmit and decode multiple channels of high quality audio for dtv and hdtv program production and broadcast distribution and to measure the subjective loudness of audio content within broadcast programming 
in fiscal  the decrease in broadcast product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue was primarily due to the recognition of digital cinema product revenue  as a result of achieving compliance with the dci specifications and satisfying all other revenue recognition criteria  as well as decreased broadcast product sales 


table of contents our services revenue  which represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  is primarily tied to the motion picture production industry and  in particular  to the number of films being made by studios and independent filmmakers 
the number of films that are produced can be affected by a number of factors  including strikes and work stoppages within the motion picture industry as well as by the tax incentive arrangements that many foreign governments provide filmmakers to promote local filmmaking 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued the fasb accounting standards codification  or asc  which superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards  with certain exceptions 
the asc is the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb applicable to non governmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases issued by the sec  under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
the asc did not change us gaap 
us gaap requires us to utilize certain accounting policies that  in turn  require us to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to a company s financial condition and results of operations and it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this annual report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following are our critical accounting policies because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 
revenue recognition we evaluate revenue recognition for transactions to license technologies  trademarks and know how  and to sell products and services using the criteria set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and accounting standards codification topic  revenue recognition asc 
for revenue transactions that involve software or software related products  such as fees we earn from integrated software vendors  certain product sales with software elements and certain other transactions  we recognize revenue under the guidance established by accounting standards codification subtopic  software revenue recognition asc 
the revenue recognition guidance states that revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
judgment is required to assess whether collectibility is probable 
we determine collectibility based on an evaluation of our customer s recent payment history  the existence of a standby letter of credit between the customer s financial institution and our financial institution and other factors 
the application of revenue recognition standards require judgment  including whether the software element included with a hardware product is more than incidental to the hardware  whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists 
table of contents for those elements 
for some of our arrangements  customers receive certain elements of the arrangement over a period of time or after delivery of the initial product 
these elements may include support and maintenance and or the right to receive product upgrades 
the fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated period for which these elements will be delivered  which is sometimes the estimated life of the product 
if we do not have vsoe of fair value for any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement containing software  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and or services have been performed  or until we have vsoe of fair value for all remaining undelivered elements 
if the undelivered element is support and we do not have fair value for the support element  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
we evaluate and test our goodwill for impairment  in accordance with the provisions of asc  at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
in the first step  the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
during our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter of fiscal  we had two reporting units via which had no assigned goodwill and dolby entertainment technology with goodwill of million 
we used the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit 
the cash flow model was based on our best estimate of future revenues and operating costs 
future revenues were estimated over the period we expect to earn such cash flows  at growth rates consistent with our internal forecasts 
the revenue and cost estimates were based on several sources including our historical information  third party industry data and review of our internal operations 
the cash flow forecasts were adjusted by a discount rate of approximately based on our weighted average cost of capital derived through a capital asset pricing model 
the primary components of this model included our considerations of the relative weighting of our total asset structure between our equity and debt  the risk free rate of return given by the rate of return on us treasury bonds  an average market risk premium based on a range of historical returns and forward looking estimates and our beta 
our model utilized an effective tax rate of approximately 
further  we evaluated the reasonableness of the fair value of our reporting units by comparing the aggregate fair value of our reporting units determined under the income approach to our market capitalization 
our market capitalization at the end of our third quarter of fiscal  the period of our annual impairment test  was approximately equal to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units determined under the income approach 
our market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units each approximated billion which exceeded the aggregate carrying value of our reporting units by approximately 
as of june   the fair values of our two reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was required 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  there were no events or circumstances that would more likely than not trigger a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  income taxes asc 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements under asc  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this process includes estimating actual 
table of contents current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  including the timing of recognition of stock based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and uncertainty in income tax positions 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted if actual results significantly differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of accounting standards codification topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires measurement of all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recording of such expense in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant 
to determine the fair value of a stock based award using the black scholes option pricing model requires that we make certain assumptions regarding the expected term of the award  the expected future volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the award and the risk free interest rate over the expected term 
we develop our assumptions for the black scholes pricing model in accordance with guidelines set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
we estimate the expected term of stock based awards by evaluating historical exercise patterns of our employees and applying an assumption of future exercise patterns 
we utilize a blend of our historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility based on traded options with similar terms as an estimate of the expected volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the awards 
we use an average interest rate based on us treasury instruments with terms consistent with the expected term of our awards to estimate the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
investments we account for our investments under the provisions of accounting standards codification topic  investments debt and equity securities asc 
investments that have original maturities of days or more at the date of purchase and with a current maturity of less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments that have maturities of more than one year are classified as long term investments 
all of our investments  except for auction rate certificates  are classified as available for sale securities 
our investments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale securities  except for credit losses as defined in asc  are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  while realized gains and losses as well as credit losses are reported as a component of net income 
auction rate certificates are classified as trading securities 
unrealized gains or losses on trading securities are reported as a component of net income 
our investments in auction rate securities have been illiquid since february due to failed auctions 
the observable market information to determine the fair value of our auction rate certificates continues to be insufficient 
therefore  we continue to estimate the fair value by incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
these assumptions include the collateral underlying the securities  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future cash flows  the likelihood of a successful auction in a future period and the final stated maturities 

table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended september  and september  revenue fiscal year ended change september  september  in thousands licensing percentage of total revenue product sales percentage of total revenue services percentage of total revenue total revenue licensing 
the increase in licensing revenue from fiscal to fiscal was driven by increased revenue from our broadcast and mobile markets 
the increase in revenue from our broadcast market was primarily driven by shipments in the us of set top boxes  including ntia converter boxes and dta devices  which contain our technologies and an increase in the number of digital televisions sold in europe and asia that incorporate our technologies when compared to the prior year 
by june  television stations in the us were required to fully transition to digital broadcast 
accordingly  we expect that revenue attributable to ntia converter boxes will not recur in fiscal the increase in revenue from our mobile market was primarily driven by the adoption of he aac technology  which was incorporated into a greater number of mobile devices sold in the current year than in the prior year 
product sales 
the increase in product sales from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by the recognition of approximately million of digital cinema product revenue  including million relating to products sold in years prior to fiscal  as a result of achieving compliance with the digital cinema initiative dci specifications and satisfying all other revenue recognition criteria 
these increases in digital cinema related product revenue were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our traditional cinema products 
as the cinema industry transitions to the use of digital cinema audio equipment  we expect sales of our traditional cinema products to continue to decline in future periods 
our digital cinema servers are typically sold as part of multiple element arrangements that include the sale of products and product support 
vsoe of fair value has not been established for the product support included within our digital cinema server arrangements  and therefore digital cinema sales and costs are deferred  and recognized for the entire arrangement ratably over the support period 
if we are able to establish vsoe for product support  we expect to immediately recognize revenue and associated costs related to our digital cinema servers that are currently deferred 
the remaining amounts attributable to product support included within our digital cinema arrangements would be recognized ratably over the remaining support period 
the fasb issued amendments to accounting standards codification subtopic  software revenue recognition and accounting standards codification subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  which apply to our multiple element product arrangements 
we will prospectively adopt this guidance in the beginning of fiscal these amendments may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as our prospective multi element product arrangements would no longer require ratable recognition treatment of the entire transaction over the expected support period 
see note recently issued accounting standards for further discussion

we license intellectual property to our customers that may be internally developed  acquired by us or licensed from third parties 
our cost of licensing consists principally of amortization expenses associated with purchased intangible assets and intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
our cost of licensing also includes third party royalty obligations for licensing their intellectual property that we then sublicense to our customers 
licensing gross margin increased four points from fiscal to fiscal  due primarily to a gain from an amended patent licensing agreement 
the gain from the amended patent licensing agreement was recorded within cost of revenue in our consolidated statement of operations in the first quarter of fiscal see note of the consolidated financial statements composition of certain financial statement captions for further discussion regarding the gain from the amended patent licensing agreement 
we do not expect a similar gain in the future 
product sales gross margin 
cost of product sales primarily consists of material costs related to the products sold  applied labor and manufacturing overhead and  to a lesser extent  amortization of certain intangible assets 
product sales gross margin decreased by five points from fiscal to fiscal  due to the recognition of revenue and associated costs related to previously deferred digital cinema related equipment sales which had significantly lower margins than our traditional cinema and broadcast products 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  we had not recognized revenue related to sales of our digital cinema related products as we had not yet achieved compliance with the dci specifications 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we achieved compliance with the dci specifications and therefore began recognizing this revenue and related costs 
the total amount of products revenue which we recognized in fiscal as a result of achieving compliance with the dci specifications was million  including million relating to products sold in years prior to fiscal the product margins related to the digital cinema related equipment revenue recognized in fiscal were particularly low due to a combination of factors that are common with new product launches  including higher initial per unit costs resulting from low manufacturing volumes 
additionally  field upgrade costs were incurred after the initial shipment of the products to the end users to ensure our products complied with our contractual obligations 
as a result of these factors  product sales gross margin in fiscal was significantly lower than our product sales gross margin in the prior year 
services gross margin 
cost of services primarily consists of payroll and benefits costs for employees performing our professional services  the cost of outside consultants and reimbursable expenses incurred on behalf of customers 
services gross margin decreased three points from fiscal to fiscal primarily driven by million of costs incurred under a promotional arrangement with a customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal this amount was charged against services revenue with no corresponding charge to cost of services

selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and personnel related expenses  professional service fees  travel related expenses and facility costs for our sales  marketing and administrative functions 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses relating to an increase in average headcount and temporary consulting expenses  partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new technologies and products 
the increase in research and development expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expenses due to increases in headcount and temporary consulting expenses resulting from an increase in research and development projects  partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense 
restructuring charges  net 
restructuring charges for fiscal include severance and other charges attributable to the consolidation of our wootton bassett  uk manufacturing operations into our brisbane  california facility 
in fiscal  we recorded charges of million related to the consolidation of our manufacturing operations 
restructuring charges also include severance and other charges resulting from integrating our wholly owned subsidiary  cinea  into our dolby entertainment technology reporting unit 
these charges were attributable to the termination of employees and to ceasing use of two leased facilities 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to the integration of cinea 
gain on settlements 
gain on settlements includes payments received related to the resolution of disputes with implementation licensees from which we do not earn royalties 
in fiscal and  we received payments totaling million and million  respectively  in connection with the settlement of disputes with certain implementation licensees 
in contrast  amounts attributable to the resolution of royalty disputes from licensees that specifically represent unpaid royalties that are subsequently paid are recorded as licensing revenue in the period payment is received and the dispute is resolved  if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met

the increase in licensing revenue from fiscal to fiscal was driven by increased revenue in all our markets  most notably our pc  broadcast  gaming and mobile markets 
historically  revenue from our consumer electronics market represented the largest percentage of our total licensing revenue 
in fiscal  revenue from our consumer electronics market declined as a percentage of our total licensing revenue and 
table of contents was surpassed by revenue from our pc market 
the increase in revenue from our pc market in fiscal was primarily driven by a full year of microsoft vista home premium and ultimate edition related revenues as compared to only half a year in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  licensing revenue benefited from a growing number of consumer notebook computer shipments with dolby pc entertainment experience  compared to fiscal the increase in revenue from our broadcast market was driven by an increase in the number of digital televisions in north america and europe that incorporate dolby digital compared to  as well as shipments of set top boxes that incorporate our technologies 
the increase in revenue from our gaming market was primarily driven by sales of game consoles 
the increase in revenue from our mobile market was primarily driven by the inclusion of he aac technology  obtained through our acquisition of coding technologies in fiscal  which is incorporated into mobile devices 
product sales 
the increase in product sales from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of our d products  which were minimal in fiscal as our d offering was introduced during the latter part of fiscal  as well as an increase in sales of our broadcast products  digital cinema processors and media adapters 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our traditional cinema products 
services 
the increase in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in film services  particularly services on original films  including digital films  as well as revenue from virtual print fees related to digital cinema

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity cash  cash equivalents and investments as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted of cash and highly liquid money market funds 
in addition  we had short term and long term investments of million  which primarily consisted of auction rate certificates  corporate bonds  municipal debt securities  united states agency securities  united states government bonds and variable rate demand notes with original maturities greater than days 
many of these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates  which could impact our results 
based on our investment portfolio balance as of september   a hypothetical change in interest rates of would have approximately a million impact  and a change of would have approximately a million impact on the carrying value of our portfolio 
furthermore  a hypothetical change in interest rates of would have approximately a million impact  and a change of would have approximately a million impact on interest income over a one year period 
as of september   we held auction rate certificates with a par value totaling million 
auctions for these instruments have failed and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed 
in the event we need access to the funds invested in these securities  we will not be able to liquidate these securities until a future auction of these securities is successful  they are refinanced and redeemed by the issuers  or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
on november   we accepted an offer from ubs ag  which we refer to  along with its wholly owned subsidiaries ubs financial services  inc and ubs securities llc  as ubs  to liquidate our auction rate certificates that we held in our ubs accounts as of february  the ubs offer entitles us to sell our auction rate certificates for a price equal to the liquidation preference of the auction rate certificates plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  if any  at any time during a two year period from june  through july  there is a risk that ubs will not perform its obligations in accordance with their offer 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will be able to recoup our investments in the auction rate certificates 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk we maintain sales  marketing and business operations in foreign countries  most significantly in the united kingdom 
we also conduct a growing portion of our business outside the united states through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar primarily euros and british pounds 
as a result  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
most of our revenue from international markets is denominated in us dollars  while the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currency 
therefore  if the us dollar weakens against the local currency  we will have increased operating expenses which are only partially offset by net revenues 
conversely  if the us dollar strengthens against the local currency  our net assets  net revenues and operating expenses will decrease and affect our net income 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility
