preschool educational program links to learning  our preschool curriculum  is an integrated series of programs for children ages six weeks to five years that engages the young learner s senses  mind and body 
the components of each program build upon each other as children grow and develop  ensuring an excellent preparation for elementary school 
the program draws from the collective expertise of renowned early age educators such as dewey  piaget and vygotsky 
the links to learning curriculum builds new learning on past experiences  and encourages each child s interest in discovery and hands on learning 
links to learning was created by the nobel learning education department  a team of highly skilled experts with extensive knowledge of early age education 
this team is guided by the national education advisory board which ensures that the curriculum reflects the latest early education research 
links to learning divides skills into eight distinct academic areas 
these areas are language and literacy  mathematics  the world and me  my community and environment  art  music  wellness and spanish 
the links to learning program features a strong parent communication component 
nobel learning believes that when parents and teachers work as partners in a child s education  the learning experience is richer and more meaningful 
parents receive a folder each month  containing an overview of the developmental skills that the child has worked on that month 
the folder contains samples of work that was completed in class  as well as a letter outlining suggested activities that can be done with the child at home 
the folder also provides a preview of the next month s skills and lessons 
teachers post weekly and daily skills lists outside the classroom 
the links to learning curriculum focuses on two vital goals developing a child s lifelong love of learning and ensuring that he she is ready for kindergarten and elementary school 
the education department studied the kindergarten standards in all of the states in which there are kindergarten classes and carefully designed the preschool program to meet or to exceed pre kindergarten expectations 
each preschool has a links to kindergarten section on its school website so that parents can be assured of a successful transition to kindergarten by matching to the appropriate state standards 

table of contents elementary and middle school educational program standards based content in nobel learning created a standards based curriculum for all grades kindergarten through eighth 
to do so  the members of the education department researched the standards in states and merged them into one set of national standards 
this was done for eleven different content areas language arts  writing  math  science  social studies  technology  physical education  wellness  art  music  spanish  and study skills 
each content area has standards with corresponding objectives of what students need to know and be able to do 
each grade level has a comprehensive curriculum binder that takes each of the eleven content areas and divides the standards and objectives into four quarterly pacing guides 
the pacing guides  then  create a synchronous curriculum for the company s national network of schools which provides unique collaborative learning opportunities  such as learning without walls projects and intrigue team projects 
delivery system the content of the nobel learning curriculum is dictated by state standards 
the delivery of that curriculum  however  is based on student centered  project based learning experiences 
the content delivery model includes traditional classroom instruction  as well as st century skills projects in grades through these projects are based on the framework provided by the partnership for the st century skills organization 
nobel learning is a professional development affiliate of the partnership for st century skills www 
stcenturyskills 
com 
the partnership for st century skills is the leading advocacy organization focused on infusing st century skills into education 
nobel learning schools deliver standards based content in a student centered  customized learning environment that includes the st century skills of collaboration  creativity  innovation  and global awareness 
these student centered  project based experiences include learning without walls projects 
examples of such projects include a th grade global warming investigation  a th grade project on waterways  a th grade project exploring mathematics through the study of systems  a th grade project about european countries  and an th grade project building leadership and entrepreneurial skills 
assessment it is essential to continuously monitor students academic performance to ensure that they meet or exceed grade level benchmarks for proficiency 
all students in grades through participate in sat testing each spring 
those test results are used to monitor student progress and to set building level achievement goals 
teachers we recognize that maintaining the quality of our teachers capabilities and professionalism is essential to sustaining our students high level of academic achievement and our profitability 
we sponsor professional development days covering various aspects of teaching and education  using both internal trainers and external consultants 
our educators serve on company task forces and committees that review and revise curricular guidelines  programs  support materials and current teaching methods 
during the school year we implemented education connections  an intranet site dedicated to providing training resources and support for our teachers 
education connections includes a teacher communication and support area  exemplary lesson plan library  grade level curriculum support and other valuable resources to support and enhance our teachers professional development  professional relationships  and satisfaction 
training school based leadership teams principals and assistant principals also actively engage in professional development and self improvement 
staff training is provided by our education department and other experts 
table of contents within the education industry 
through participation in our annual national principal conference  seasoned administrators as well as new recruits are kept abreast of up to date research  changing trends and sound pedagogical practices 
in addition  our executive directors and many of our highest performing principals are utilized as trainers to help with professional development and curriculum implementation in our schools 
school operations standards in order to maintain appropriate standards  our schools share consistent educational goals and operating procedures 
while we have a national curriculum  principals may tailor curricula  within the standards of nobel learning communities education department guidelines  to meet local and state requirements 
members of our management team visit schools on a regular basis to review program  facility and staff quality 
hiring and retaining quality personnel at our schools and in operational management positions is a critical success factor in driving success in both operational and financial performance 
our school principals and assistant principals are responsible for all facets of school operations including curriculum implementation  ensuring student achievement and success  personnel and financial management  community outreach  student discipline and implementing local sales and marketing strategies 
the principals and assistant principals are supported by our regional operations  education and human resources teams and our centralized marketing  real estate  facilities and finance organizations 
we operate and review our performance based on both geographic cluster and individual school based performance criteria 
our operations have annual budgets and financial and operating information is collected daily 
certain measures of school and cluster performance are reviewed weekly and others are reviewed monthly or quarterly 
we determine whether to monitor a particular aspect of performance based on its impact on our operational and financial objectives 
for example  net revenue  tuition revenue  certain operating costs and student census information are monitored weekly in relation to our objectives 
executive directors executive directors oversee the principals and schools and report to a regional vice president 
executive directors  along with our education department  are responsible for ensuring the qualifications of principals and assistant principals  as well as training and development 
school principals and executive directors work closely with regional education managers and corporate management  particularly in the regular assessment of program quality and school performance 
we hire qualified candidates and attempt to promote from within when possible 
candidate credentials are reviewed through employment references  criminal background checks and appropriate education verification in order to establish an understanding of the candidates skills  professionalism and character 
after hiring  it is our policy that employees receive regular performance feedback including a formal annual performance evaluation 
our principals and executive directors may be eligible for incentive compensation based on the performance of their schools 
private pay schools general education schools 
our preschool and elementary middle school strategy is based on clustering of preschools around an elementary school in order to provide a continuum of education and consistent curriculum for children from infancy through th grade 
clusters of schools are placed in geographic markets where the economy and population meet our demographic profile 
in several markets  students from our preschools can easily matriculate into our elementary middle school programs 
in addition  we can potentially convert students from our other specialty programs to our general education programs 

table of contents we also operate schools that are not part of a complete geographic cluster 
many of these schools were built or purchased prior to the implementation of our cluster strategy or may be the initial school in a new market 
in some cases  these schools may become part of a cluster if we determine the demographic profile in the market provides a growth opportunity  in which case additional schools will be added to the cluster 
many of our preschools and elementary schools allow for early drop off and late pick up to accommodate busy parent schedules 
in most preschool locations  programs are available for children starting at six weeks of age 
we believe that parents can feel comfortable leaving their children at one of our schools knowing the children will receive both a quality education and engage in well supervised developmental  recreational and enrichment activities 
our schools offer athletic activities and supplemental programs  which include day field trips coordinated with our curriculum to zoos  libraries  museums and theaters and  at the middle schools  overnight trips to such places as national parks and historical locations  and select summer trips to european destinations 
schools arrange classroom presentations by parents  community leaders and other volunteers to supplement instruction 
we also organize programs that allow students to present to community groups and organizations 
to enhance the child s physical  social  emotional and intellectual growth  schools may provide extra curricular experiences some fee based tailored to particular families interests 
these activities include but are not limited to dance  gymnastics  instrumental music lessons and computer based technology programs 
additionally  students expand their horizons through participation in science fairs  drama clubs and local and regional academic competitions 
most of our preschools and elementary schools complement their educational programs with enrichment programs  arts programs  before and after school programs and summer programs or camps 
in addition to those revenue generating programs  our schools seek to improve margins by providing ancillary services and products  such as portrait photos  books and uniform sales 
before and after school programs during fiscal the company acquired the enchanted care learning centers in the central ohio market 
in addition to nine preschools  these centers include six stand alone buildings operating as kid s campuses 
the kid s campus locations provide before and after programs in state of the art facilities dedicated exclusively to elementary school aged children 
these programs help children mature socially and academically  and our well trained teachers learn and work with a child s individual learning style 
we offer a variety of activities and resources  including computer animal science lab a place to learn about different animals while developing computer and research skills basketball gym fully equipped for healthy competition  fitness and team building music drama dance stage activities incorporate costumes  dance  drama and music and culminate in fun theatrical productions art studio children explore their creativity through painting  drawing  and sculpting movie theatre a full schedule of educational and exciting films fills our big screen cafeteria make bake kitchen children learn what makes up a nutritious meal  while picking up basic cooking and baking skills homework library a quiet place to do homework  study  read and interact with teachers 
the kid s campuses locations also provide summer camp programs for preschool and school age children 
with these rich and targeted programs  the kid s campus locations  plus one additional before and after school location acquired in the dallas area and operating as part of our merryhill schools  provide additional growth potential in existing and new markets for the company 

table of contents paladin academy our paladin academy school and programs serve the needs of children with mild to moderate learning challenges from kindergarten through th grade 
our mission is to improve the learning process and achievement levels of children with dyslexia  attention deficit disorder  dysgraphia and other mild learning difficulties through stand alone schools and school based programs 
we offer developmental testing  full day clinics and summer programs 
the primary goal of our paladin academy program is to enable students to mainstream back into the general school population 
we operate one stand alone paladin academy school and six school based programs or clinics integrated within our elementary schools 
paladin academy schools and or programs are now located in florida  north carolina  pennsylvania and virginia 
at the end of fiscal  we re located our stand alone paladin academy to a new site in the existing geographic market area 
houston learning academy under the name houston learning academy hla  we operate six special purpose high schools in the houston metropolitan marketplace 
hla schools  which are fully accredited by the southern association of colleges and schools  offer a half day high school program  as well as evening and summer school programs 
hla schools and programs feature individualized attention  primarily for those students who are at risk of not completing their high school requirements in a more traditional setting and or are attracted to the schools program and flexible hours of service 
marketing our primary sources for generating new enrollments include word of mouth recommendations from current parents  interactive marketing including search engine marketing  direct mail campaigns  yellow page listings and public relations programs 
we utilize a sophisticated paid search engine marketing program that is customized to generate and track new leads for each individual market and product type 
we also market to our own database of parent inquiries through ongoing direct mail and e mail communications 
marketing efforts towards continuous improvement of customer acquisition and retention are directed by a central marketing team 
working in conjunction with school operations management and the education team  marketing formulates consistent brand positioning and communication strategies that can be customized to each local area and type of school 
the efforts of central marketing are supplemented by community based activities conducted by our local executive directors and principals 
our annual marketing calendar is synchronized to the typical customer demand cycle for enrollment 
although marketing campaigns and demand take place throughout the year  we direct the most marketing resources towards our preschool enrollments in late summer and early winter and towards our k schools during fall and winter 
the company has implemented a number of marketing communication tools to strengthen our communications with existing customers and increase customer retention and length of stay 
these tools include  but are not limited to  e mail newsletters  enhanced school specific websites  updated in school and in classroom communication materials and parent satisfaction surveys 
corporate development strategy and implementation our growth strategy in the private education market includes internal growth of our enrollment at existing schools  expansion of current facilities  new school development in both existing and new markets and strategic acquisitions 

table of contents much of our focus is on increasing occupancy and ancillary program revenue in our existing schools and leveraging the investment in those assets 
management has implemented training programs designed to strengthen principals and executive directors sales  marketing and customer service skills and invests in school administrative staffing 
in addition  to broaden the potential career path opportunities for employees  we have provided employees the ability to move between locations as appropriate opportunities arise 
the similar business and education model our schools operate under permits the company to execute on this career path strategy 
as our growth has increased  we now have a number of examples where our principals or assistant principals have transferred to other schools in different geographic markets 
while a portion of our efforts have focused on improving the performance of existing schools  the company continues its increased efforts to identify opportunities to develop and open new schools and to acquire schools in support of our demographically profiled geographic market cluster strategy  in both existing and new markets 
we regularly analyze the profitability of our existing school and real estate portfolio to identify schools that are underperforming and or do not fit our business model or demographic based geographic cluster strategies 
we then develop plans either to improve these schools or remove them from our portfolio 
this represents an important activity in reallocating capital to the balance of our schools in order to ensure the continued improvement of our program offerings and overall company performance 
at the end of fiscal  this process resulted in the closure of six schools 
new school development during fiscal  the company opened four new preschools 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company opened three additional preschools and has one preschool under construction 
for new school development  we typically engage a developer or contractor to build a facility to our specifications 
we also look to occupy existing buildings that are appropriate for our schools and that are located in growth areas that meet our demographic requirements 
the company continues  as part of its strategy  to focus on private pay markets supported by complementary demographics 
our new school development strategy builds upon our practice of clustering preschools around an elementary school in order to provide a continuum of education and consistent curriculum for children from infancy through th grade 
clusters of schools are placed in geographic markets where the economy and population meet our demographic profile 
in several markets  students from our preschools can easily matriculate into our elementary middle school programs 
in addition  we can potentially convert students from our specialty and before and after programs to our general education programs 
acquisitions we expect to use strategic acquisitions to expand our business 
key acquisition criteria include reputation  location in markets meeting our target demographics  growth prospects  quality of personnel and the ability to integrate into existing market clusters or become the platform for new market clusters 
our acquisition strategy primarily focuses on schools that fit our demographic and cluster strategy and which serve the preschool and or kindergarten through eighth grade market  either directly serving the consumer or supporting a corporation or other entity in providing preschool and other related services to their employees 
from time to time we evaluate opportunities which  while all related in educational content  may provide the company entry into a variety of other business models 
these may include companies that have business models that focus on extending our platform through high school  on line k schools  on line course delivery  enrichment programs  summer camps  technology based before and after schools programs  and concepts with a focus on international students 

table of contents the company seeks to identify acquisition opportunities at appropriate prices that will allow the acquisition to create stockholder value over time through the acquisitions creation of new growth opportunities  scalability or synergy with our existing school portfolio and or geographic markets 
at the end of fiscal  the company made its first acquisition in over three years 
the honor roll school acquisition allowed the company to enter a new geographic market by purchasing an already successful prek program 
this acquisition provided the company the opportunity to expand the honor roll school brand by developing or acquiring new preschools in the houston market to develop a robust feeder system to the k school 
during fiscal the company further enhanced the value of the honor roll school acquisition and the honor roll brand by acquiring a nearby preschool which was quickly re branded as the honor roll preschool 
the honor roll preschool is now a feeder school which sends students to the honor roll school 
during fiscal  the company entered a new geographic market with the acquisition of the six discovery isle preschools in san diego  california 
in this case  the acquisition provided the company the opportunity to expand the discovery isle preschool brand through the development or acquisition of additional preschools and elementary and or middle school s that could utilize the discovery isle preschools as a feeder system for elementary school students 
during fiscal the company further enhanced the value of the discovery isle acquisition and the discovery isle brand by acquiring two additional schools in the southern california market previously branded as teddy bear treehouse schools  which were quickly re branded as discovery isle schools 
also during fiscal the company acquired four learning ladder preschools  three of which were rebranded under the company s existing chesterbrook academy brand  and the fourth of which was closed shortly after completing the acquisition 
during fiscal the company acquired enchanted care learning centers  and as described under the private pay schools section above  the acquisition included six standalone facilities offering before and after school programs for elementary school age children under the kid s campus trade name 
this acquisition provides the company opportunities in existing and new geographic markets to further develop its growth strategy 
in addition  the fiscal acquisition of the ivy glen schools in the dallas market also provided the company with one standalone before and after school program 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company acquired three montessori schools in central new jersey collectively referred to as montessori corner  the addition of these schools added one elementary school and two preschools to the three montessori method schools already in the company s portfolio of schools 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company acquired the highpointe children s academy highpointe 
the addition of highpointe added a preschool and an elementary school and expanded the company s existing market coverage in the dallas  texas market 
during the third quarter of fiscal the company acquired country tyme preschool  which expanded the company s existing market coverage in the southeastern pennsylvania market 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired southern highlands preparatory schools shps which included a preschool and elementary school and expanded the company s existing market coverage in the las vegas  nevada market 
shps has become a destination middle school for many of our elementary school students from one of our merryhill elementary schools in that market 
additionally  during the first quarter of fiscal the company acquired ivy kids learning center school ivy kids which has subsequently been rebranded under the company s existing the honor roll school brand 
the ivy kids acquisition expanded the company s existing market coverage in the houston  texas market by adding one preschool to a market in which the company currently operates

this location is included in acquired schools and closed locations in the rollforward provided under the management discussion and analysis section below 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company closed one camelback desert school 
the results of this school are included in net income loss from discontinued operations in the periods presented in this form k 
during the first quarter of  the company acquired the laurel springs school laurel springs  an online and distance learning school www 
laurelsprings 
com 
laurel springs educational program spans the entire k market and has a fully accredited curriculum that includes honors ap courses  a gifted and talented program  a chapter of the national honors society and a strong college preparatory program 
laurel springs student body includes elite athletes  entertainers  and home schooled students from all states and from foreign countries 
laurel springs extends the company s educational programs through high school and provides a fully integrated k platform 
seasonality our elementary middle schools historically have lower operating revenues in the summer due to the end of the traditional academic year and seasonally lower enrollment and related fees in summer programs 
summer revenues of preschools are  to a lesser degree  subject to the same seasonality 
management seeks to reduce the seasonal fluctuations of the company s revenue stream by adding to its schools a mix of products and services  such as camp programs  in the lower revenue seasons 
industry and competition education reform movements in the united states are providing new alternatives to the public schools 
these reforms include charter schools  private management of public schools  home schooling  private schools  virtual charter schools  state run virtual schools  virtual private schools and voucher programs 
our strategy is to provide parents a high quality alternative to public schools through our privately owned and operated schools  utilizing proven curriculum in a safe and challenging environment 
while our schools do not currently reside in any school voucher markets  we believe voucher programs may be a positive development for our schools  
table of contents should we choose to accept them 
we consider each of these alternatives to be competition for our schools and the expansion or contraction of funding and or public support of these alternatives may impact the demand for our product  available real estate and our ability to increase or maintain our operating margins 
furthermore  we compete with other for profit private schools  charter schools  non profit schools  sectarian schools  private virtual schools  public virtual schools and home schooling 
we also face competition with respect to preschool services and before and after school programs from public schools  government based providers and religiously affiliated community based or other non profit programs that may offer such services at little or no cost to parents 
we anticipate that  given the perceived potential of the education market  well financed competition may emerge  including possible competition from the large for profit child care companies and international school operators 
we believe the only large for profit competitors that integrate preschool  elementary education and school age programs in the us and that currently compete beyond a regional level are privately held knowledge learning corp  bright horizons family solutions  inc and mini skools  challenger schools and abc learning through its learning care group subsidiary 
we also face competition in each of our demographic markets from local operators of individually owned private schools 
finally  public school systems may become stronger competitors at the preschool level if additional states pass or expand universal pre k legislation that provides public funds for preschool for three and four year olds and do not allow for profit preschool operators to participate in these programs  or fund payments to for profit operators at lower than market prices or costs 
while price is an important factor in competing in both the preschool and elementary school markets  we believe that other competitive factors also are important  including location  professionally developed educational programs  qualified and trained school administrators  well equipped facilities  relationships with local employers  trained teachers and a broad range of ancillary services  including before and after school programs  transportation and infant care 
some of these services are not offered by some of our competitors 
we conduct annual tuition rate surveys and believe we are competitively priced in each of our markets 
regulation our schools are subject to national  state and local regulations and licensing requirements 
we have policies and procedures in place to assist in complying with such regulations and requirements 
these regulations and the administrative bodies in charge of these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may apply differently within the same jurisdiction to a preschool  elementary or middle school 
the regulatory and licensing requirements tend to be more stringent with respect to preschools  as government agencies generally review the fitness and adequacy of buildings and equipment  the ratio of staff personnel to enrolled children  staff training  record keeping  children s dietary program  daily curriculum and compliance with health and safety standards 
in most jurisdictions  these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of the schools and licenses must be renewed periodically 
most jurisdictions establish requirements for background checks or other clearance procedures for new employees of schools 
repeated failures of a school to comply with applicable regulations can subject the school to sanctions  which might include probation or  in more serious cases  suspension or revocation of the school s license to operate and could also lead to investigations of our other schools located in the same jurisdiction 
in addition  this type of action could lead to negative publicity extending beyond that jurisdiction and potentially affecting our other locations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with all material regulations applicable to our business 
however  there is no assurance that a licensing authority will not determine a particular school to be in violation of applicable regulations and take action against that school and possibly other schools in the same jurisdiction 
in addition  there may be unforeseen changes in regulations and licensing requirements  such as changes in the required ratio of child center staff personnel to enrolled children that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
states in which we operate routinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing requirements and implement changes  which may significantly increase our costs to operate in those states 
environmental compliance we are not aware of any existing environmental conditions that currently or in the future could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows and we 
table of contents have not incurred material expenditures to address environmental conditions at any school 
although we have periodically conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our schools  we have not undertaken an in depth environmental review of all of our schools and accordingly  there may be material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
in addition  no assurances can be given that future laws or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability 
insurance we currently maintain comprehensive general liability  workers compensation  automobile liability  property  excess umbrella liability  terrorism  student accident insurance and directors and officers liability insurance 
the policies provide a variety of coverages and limits 
companies involved in the education and care of children  however  may not be able to obtain insurance for the total risks inherent in their operations 
in particular  general liability coverage can have sublimits per claim for child abuse 
although we believe we have adequate insurance coverage at this time  claims in excess of  or not included within  our coverage may be asserted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that in future years we will not become subject to lower limits or substantial increase in insurance premiums 
employees as of september   we employed approximately  persons 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory 
recently the child care industry in general saw an increase in organized labor contacts with child care workers and preschool teachers  especially in states such as washington and california 
while there have been no specific attempts to organize our teachers or other employees  there is no assurance that in future years we or the industry will not be subject to some form of labor organization attempt

risk factors 
each of the following risks  individually or in a group  could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the unsolicited proposals by knowledge learning corporation to acquire the outstanding shares of the company  which were rejected unanimously by the company s board of directors  have created uncertainty that could adversely affect the ability of the company to execute its strategic plan and lead to the use of additional management resources 
during fiscal  the company received unsolicited expressions of interest from knowledge learning corporation to pursue an acquisition of the company 
as part of its evaluation of the proposals  the company 
table of contents engaged and consulted with financial and legal advisors to decide whether pursuing the possible transaction would be in the best interest of the company s stockholders 
additionally  the company s board of directors also authorized a committee consisting solely of independent directors to evaluate the proposals 
subsequently  the company announced that its board of directors  in consultation with its financial and legal advisors  unanimously rejected knowledge learning corporation s proposal to acquire the company 
the company s board of directors remains open to considering strategic transactions which fully and fairly recognize the company s value and are in the best interest of stockholders 
prospective sellers whose schools the company may acquire may perceive the possibility that the board will continue to receive  and potentially approve  proposals for strategic transactions as a negative factor in determining whether to sell their school to the company 
as a result  the company may face additional challenges in entering into and consummating key acquisitions 
in addition  management resources may be diverted away from operational issues and towards assessment and response to strategic transaction proposals  this diversion of resources may slow our progress in achieving certain operational and corporate development goals 
unemployment rates of current or potential customers may adversely impact the company 
the company believes that more than a majority of the company s customers are dual income households and the company is dependent on this demographic characteristic a target demographic characteristic of the company to support annual comparable school revenue growth and sustainability 
demand for our product is directly related to certain economic factors  including the unemployment rate  personal disposable income  birth rate and pricing 
as unemployment rates rise  birth rates slow and or income decelerates or reverses  there is a risk that demand for our services may drop 
such a decrease in demand may have a direct adverse impact on school enrollment and revenue growth 
changing economic conditions the company s revenue and net income are subject to general economic conditions 
the company s revenues depend  in part  on the number of dual income families and working single parents who require child development  child care or educational services 
a deterioration of general economic conditions  including a soft housing market and rising unemployment may adversely impact the company because of the tendency of out of work parents to diminish or discontinue utilization of these services 
in addition  the company may not be able to increase tuition at a rate consistent with increases in wages  health insurance and other operating costs or continue tuition increases at historical rates experienced in the industry 
in addition  there can be no assurance that demographic trends  including the number of dual income families in the work force  will continue to lead to increased market share 
recently  the general economy and budget constraints have caused some public school systems to study moving to a four day school week  year round school calendar or shorter school year 
to the extent that there are any material changes to the traditional school year schedule  it may impact our business 
there is uncertainty as to whether these changes will be implemented in any of our markets and if so  what the impact on our business may be 
additionally  due to state and local economic pressures due to the general economy  many public school systems are changing their policy relating to providing transportation for children within the school district who attend private school 
while we have few schools whose students receive transportation through public school systems  there may be some impact on students in some of our schools  should the public school systems change their transportation policies 
finally  in reaction to the recession and budget cuts  many public school systems are re evaluating policies and programs such as class size  subjects offered  transportation and athletic programs 
while we do not yet know the impact of decisions made by numerous local school systems  it is possible that changes in public school programs or policies could impact our schools and enrollments 
it is unclear whether any potential impact will be positive or negative to our business 

table of contents the company s ability to obtain the capital required to implement fully its business and strategic plan our ability to execute our business and strategic plan is dependent upon the availability of adequate financing sources on acceptable terms 
our efforts to execute our business plan and open or acquire new schools are subject to our ability to finance such growth 
based on current economic events and the related restraint in the capital markets  financing resources may be inadequate to support new school openings or acquisitions  we may be required to seek additional capital to support such expansion efforts 
such additional capital may take the form of the issuance of debt or equity securities  among other forms 
beyond our existing revolving senior credit facility  we presently have no commitments to provide the company with any additional capital should we determine that additional capital is required 
in the event that management determines that additional capital is required to support the company s business and strategic plan  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure such financing on acceptable terms under the current condition of the capital markets 
if we are unable to secure needed additional capital  our growth efforts would be curtailed 
the company s inability to maintain compliance with financial covenants as required defined by the amended and restated credit agreement dated june  among the company and its lenders the credit agreement the company is required to meet or exceed certain financial covenants as defined by the credit agreement 
as the company s revenue and net income are subject to general economic conditions as described above  there may be risks in meeting or exceeding these covenants 
the potential risks of not meeting these covenants could include the inability to borrow under the credit agreement  the requirement to repay outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement  a charge from the lenders to amend the credit agreement or to waive the non compliance  and an increased interest costs  certain of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s ability to hire and retain qualified executive directors  principals  teachers and teachers aides the company may experience difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in various markets necessary to meet growth opportunities 
hiring and retaining qualified personnel may require increased salaries and enhanced benefits in more competitive markets 
difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified personnel may also impact the company s ability to obtain additional  and retain existing enrollment at its preschools and elementary schools 
in addition  while the company s wage ranges are generally materially above minimum wage  any future changes to federal and state changes to the minimum wage laws may reduce the qualified applicant pool or increase our wage costs 
recently the child care industry in general saw an increase in organized labor contacts with child care workers and preschool teachers  especially in states such as washington and california 
while there have been no specific attempts to organize our teachers or other employees  there is no assurance that in future years we or the industry will not be subject to some form of labor organization attempt 
the company s ability to retain key individuals in acquired schools and or successfully identify  acquire  grow and integrate acquired schools operations acquisitions are an ongoing part of the company s growth strategy 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including potential difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  not meeting financial objectives  additional need for capital investment  undisclosed liabilities not covered by insurance or indemnification provisions in the acquisition agreement  diversion of management s attention in connection with an acquisition and potential loss of key employees of the acquired operation 
no assurance can be given as to the success of the company in identifying  executing and assimilating acquisitions in the future or the ability to identify satisfactory acquisition targets and successfully complete any acquisition 

table of contents the company s inability to defend successfully against or counter negative publicity associated with claims involving alleged incidents at its schools because of the nature of its business  the company is and expects that in the future it will be subject to claims and litigation alleging negligence  inadequate supervision and other grounds for liability arising from injuries or other harm to the people it serves  primarily children 
in addition  claimants may seek damages from the company for child abuse  sexual abuse and other acts allegedly committed by company employees 
there can be no assurance that additional lawsuits will not be filed  that the company s insurance will be adequate to cover liabilities resulting from any claim or that any such claim or that the publicity resulting from it will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition including  without limitation  adverse effects caused by increased cost or decreased availability of insurance and decreased demand for the company s services 
we currently maintain comprehensive general liability  workers compensation  automobile liability  property  excess umbrella liability  terrorism  student accident insurance and directors and officers liability insurance 
the policies provide a variety of coverages and limits 
companies involved in the education and care of children  however  may not be able to obtain insurance for the total risks inherent in their operations 
in particular  general liability coverage can have sublimits per claim for child abuse 
although we believe we have adequate insurance coverage at this time  claims in excess of  or not included within  our coverage may be asserted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that in future years we will not become subject to lower limits or substantial increase in insurance premiums 
the impact of the litigation with the us department of justice concerning alleged violations of the americans with disabilities act of on our results of operations or cash flows in future periods the united states department of justice disability rights section of the civil rights division doj filed a lawsuit on april  in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against the company alleging that the company violated title iii of the americans with disabilities act of ada by excluding children with disabilities from its schools and programs 
the complaint seeks an unspecified amount in compensatory damages and civil penalties  as well as declaratory and injunctive relief 
the company is committed to complying with and believes it has complied with the ada in providing access to children with disabilities 
the company believes that the doj s allegations are without merit  and intends to defend against these allegations vigorously 
the company is not able at this time to estimate the range of loss  if any  arising out this matter since its outcome is uncertain 
although it does not expect that the resolution of the matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  there can be no assurances in this regard 
competitive conditions in the pre school and elementary school education and services industry the company competes for individual enrollment in a highly fragmented market 
for enrollment  the company competes with residential based child care operated out of the caregiver s home and center based child care which may include work site child care centers  full and part time child care centers and preschools  private and public elementary schools  and church affiliated  government subsidized and other not for profit providers and schools 
in addition  substitutes for organized preschool  child care  and educational services  such as relatives and others caring for a child or home schooling  can represent lower cost alternatives to the company s services 
management believes the company s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including qualifications of principals and teachers  quality of care  quality of curriculum  site convenience and cost 
the company often is at a price disadvantage with respect to these alternative providers  who operate with little or no rental expense  little or no curriculum expense  and generally may not comply or are not required to comply with the same health  safety  insurance and operational regulations as the company 
competitors in the private pay education service segment also may offer similar or competing services at a lower 
table of contents price than the company and some may have access to greater financial resources than the company 
the company also competes with many not for profit providers of child care and preschools  some of which receive government subsidies  as well as elementary schools  some of which are able to offer lower pricing than the company 
in addition  the company is currently studying the impact  if any  of the rapid expansion of virtual  or on line  schools on demand for the company s elementary and middle school products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
the company s ability to find affordable real estate and renew existing locations on terms acceptable to the company the company may experience an inability to identify and successfully negotiate or renew existing leases at attractive rents  which may impact the company s profitability 
in addition  if the company cannot renew school leases for an appropriate term length  it may impact enrollment should parents become concerned with the length of time a school will remain open in a particular location 
government regulations affecting school operations the company s schools or other school and child care based centers and programs are subject to numerous national  state and local regulations and licensing requirements 
although these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  government agencies generally review  among other things  the adequacy of buildings and equipment  licensed capacity  the ratio of staff to children  educational qualifications of teachers and staff training  record keeping  the dietary program  the daily curriculum  hiring practices and compliance with health and safety standards 
failure of any location to comply with applicable regulations and requirements could subject it to governmental sanctions  which might include fines  corrective orders  probation  or  in more serious cases  suspension or revocation of the location s license to operate or an award of damages to private litigants and could require significant expenditures by the company to bring its location into compliance 
many government agencies may publish or publicly report major and or minor regulatory violations and the company may suffer adverse publicity  which could result in a loss of enrollment in a school or market 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with all material regulations applicable to our business 
however  there is no assurance that a licensing authority will not determine a particular school to be in violation of applicable regulations and take action against that school and possibly other schools in the same jurisdiction 
in addition  there may be unforeseen changes in regulations and licensing requirements  such as changes in the required ratio of child center staff personnel to enrolled children that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
states in which we operate routinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing requirements and implement changes  which may significantly increase our costs to operate in those states 
we have several special purpose high schools that provide our graduates with state approved high school diplomas 
there have been instances in the past when the local school district has determined our education materials or curriculum did not meet requirements for credit in their district thereby limiting our ability to successfully attract students 
there is a risk that such determinations may be made in the future with respect to the same or different schools  and that as a result  our enrollment in such schools will suffer 
the establishment of government mandated universal pre k or similar programs or benefits that do not allow for participation by for profit operators or allows for participation at low reimbursement rates national  state or local child care and early age education benefit programs relying primarily on subsidies in the form of tax credits or other direct financial aid could provide the company opportunities for expansion in additional markets  especially where these benefits are universal based on residency and age  as opposed to those based on socio economic need or measures 
however  a universal benefit with governmentally mandated or publicly provided child care could reduce the demand for educational services at the company s existing locations 
even in situations where the company was allowed to provide publicly funded early age education programs  the amount of public funding  the rates at which the subsidies are granted  our subsidy participation requirements or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition if the company were to undertake these programs 

table of contents environmental or health related events that could affect schools in areas impacted by such events we are not aware of any existing environmental conditions that currently or in the future could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows and we have not incurred material expenditures to address environmental conditions at any school 
although we have periodically conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our schools  we have not undertaken an in depth environmental review of all of our schools and accordingly  there may be material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
in addition  no assurances can be given that future laws or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability 
a regional or global health pandemic could severely disrupt our business 
a health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time 
if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur  depending upon its severity and duration  the company s business could be severely affected 
enrollment in our schools could experience sharp declines as parents might avoid taking their children out in public in the event of a health pandemic  and local  regional or national governments might limit or ban public interactions to halt or delay the spread of disease causing business disruptions and the temporary closure of our schools 
we have not had any schools temporarily close due to the recent hn virus  but cannot be certain that this will not occur in the future 
should there be a case or a number of cases of the hn virus occurring in our schools  we cannot predict the impact to our business or the effect on enrollment at our schools 
additionally  a health pandemic could also impair our ability to hire and retain an adequate level of staff 
the impact of a health pandemic on the company might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the interaction of people for the sale of their products and services 
our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by acts of god  such as natural disasters  in locations where we own and or lease school properties 
some types of losses  such as those from earthquakes  hurricanes  terrorism and environmental hazards may be either uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the school 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any lease obligations  mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
in addition  inadequate preparedness  contingency planning or recovery capability in relation to a major incident or crisis may prevent operational continuity and consequently impact the value of the reputation of our business 
a small number of shareholders control a majority of the outstanding common stock of the company a limited number of our shareholders can exert significant influence over us 
as of september   four shareholders and their affiliates controlled approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
this share ownership would permit these and other stockholders  if they chose to act together  to exert significant influence over the outcome of stockholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  by law amendments  possible mergers  corporate control contests and other significant corporate transactions 
ability to maintain effective controls over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
a control system can only provide reasonable  not absolute  assurance that misstatements in financial reporting will be detected or prevented 
the effectiveness of a system of internal controls may deteriorate if controls become inadequate due to changes in conditions or if compliance with the policies or procedures declines 
the key element to a system of internal control is competent personnel implementing the controls  the company may not be able to hire enough competent personnel to accomplish this 
the effect of anti takeover provisions in the company s certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law and shareholders rights plan the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that could make more difficult the acquisition of the company by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise 
these 
table of contents provisions establish staggered terms for members of the company s board of directors and include advance notice procedures for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors of the company and for stockholders to submit proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings 
in addition  the company is subject to section of the delaware general corporation law dgcl which limits transactions between a publicly held company and interested stockholders generally  those stockholders who  together with their affiliates and associates  own or more of a company s outstanding capital stock 
this provision of the dgcl may have the effect of deterring certain potential acquisitions of nobel learning communities 
the company s certificate of incorporation provides for  authorized but unissued shares of preferred  the rights  preferences  qualifications  limitations and restrictions of which may be fixed by the company s board of directors without any further action by stockholders 
on july   the company s board of directors adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan designed to protect the company s shareholders in the event of an attempt to acquire control of the company on terms which do not secure fair value for all of the company s shareholders 
the board has adopted a limited duration plan that expires in four years  rather than the more common ten year term 
the four year term was selected to provide the company with an opportunity to maximize long term shareholder value by enabling management of the company to execute on its growth strategy  while protecting shareholders from a creeping acquisition or other tactics to gain control of the company without offering all shareholders an adequate price 
in addition  the plan is not intended to prevent a takeover 
instead  it is intended to encourage anyone seeking to acquire the company to negotiate with the company s board of directors prior to attempting a takeover in order to ensure that any takeover reflects an adequate price and that the interests of the company s shareholders and other constituencies
