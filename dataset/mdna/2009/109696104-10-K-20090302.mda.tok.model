these services include armored car transportation  automated teller machine atm replenishment and servicing  currency deposit processing and cash management services 
cash management services include cash logistics services cash logistics  deploying and servicing safes and safe control devices eg our patented compusafe service  coin sorting and wrapping  integrated check and cash processing services virtual vault services  arranging secure transportation of valuables over long distances and around the world global services  and guarding services  including airport security 
management allocates resources to and makes operating decisions on a geographic basis 
as a result  we changed our reportable segments in the fourth quarter of to international and north america 
in  our reportable segments were brink s and bhs 
our international segment includes three distinct regions emea  latin america and asia pacific 
our north america segment includes operations in the us and canada 
we believe that brink s has significant competitive advantages including brand name recognition reputation for a high level of service and security risk management and logistics expertise global infrastructure and customer base proprietary cash processing and information systems high quality insurance coverage and general financial strength 
we focus our time and resources on service quality  protecting and strengthening our brand  and addressing our risks 
we are a premium provider of services in most of the markets we serve 
our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the brink s brand  so we seek to protect and build its value 
since our services focus on handling  transporting  protecting  and managing valuables  we strive to understand and manage risk 
overlaying our approach is an understanding that we must be disciplined and patient enough to charge prices that reflect the value provided  the risk assumed and the need for an adequate return for our investors 
business environments around the world change constantly 
we must adapt to changes in competitive landscapes  regional economies and each customer s level of business 
we balance underlying business risk and the effects of changing demand on the utilization of our resources 
as a result  we operate largely on a decentralized basis so local management can react quickly to changes in the business environment 
we measure financial performance on a long term basis 
the key financial factors on which we focus are return on capital revenue and earnings growth cash flow generation these and similar measures are critical components of our incentive compensation plans and performance evaluations 
because of our emphasis on managing risks while providing a high level of service  we believe brink s spends more than its competitors on training and retaining employees  as well as on facilities 
as a result  we focus our marketing and selling efforts on customers who appreciate the value and breadth of our services  information capabilities  risk management and financial strength 
in order to earn an adequate return on capital  we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources as well as appropriate pricing levels 
we attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches  vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety  security or service 
due to our higher investment in people and processes  we generally charge higher prices than competitors that do not provide the same level of service and risk management 
despite an extremely challenging business environment in we achieved an increase in segment operating profit of basis points 
we expect organic revenue growth in the mid to high single digit range  with a segment operating profit margin close to 
we define organic revenue growth as revenue growth excluding changes in revenue earned from newly acquired businesses and changes in revenue due to changes in currency exchange rates 
we are targeting long term organic revenue growth in the high single digit percentage range and segment operating margin improvement of basis points per year  but these long term goals depend on an economic recovery 
our goal is to eventually achieve a segment operating margin when economic conditions improve 
the industries we serve have been consolidating 
as a result  the demands and expectations of customers in these industries have grown 
customers are increasingly seeking suppliers  such as brink s  with broad geographic solutions  sophisticated outsourcing capabilities and financial strength 
our operating results may vary from period to period 
since revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported  they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers 
as contracts generally run for one or more years  costs are incurred to prepare to serve  or to transition away  from a customer 
we also periodically incur costs to reduce operations when volumes decline  including costs to reduce the number of employees and close or consolidate branch and administrative facilities 
in addition  safety and security costs can vary depending on performance  cost of insurance coverage  and changes in crime rates ie attacks and robberies 
cash logistics is a fully integrated solution that proactively manages the supply chain of cash from point of sale through bank deposit 
the process includes cashier balancing and reporting  deposit processing and consolidation  and electronic information exchange including same day credit capabilities 
retail customers use brink s cash logistics services to count and reconcile coins and currency in a secure environment  to prepare bank deposit information  and to replenish customer coins and currency in proper denominations 
because cash logistics involves a higher level of service and more complex activities  customers are charged higher prices  which result in higher margins 
the ability to offer cash logistics to customers differentiates brink s from many of its competitors 
as a result  management is focused on continuing to grow cash logistics revenue 
brink s revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter  because of generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season 
conversely  margins are typically lower in the first half of the year 
on october   we completed the tax free spin off of brink s home security holdings  inc bhs  our former monitored security business in north america 
on august   we sold our domestic cash handling operations in the united kingdom 
on january   we sold bax global inc bax global  a wholly owned freight transportation subsidiary  for approximately billion in cash and recorded a pretax gain of approximately million 
see discontinued operations for a description of the transactions and see liquidity and capital resources for a description of the effect of these dispositions on our cash flow and financial position 
we have reported the earnings and cash flows of these operations within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we have significant liabilities associated with our former operations  primarily related to retirement plans  which are partially funded by plan trusts 
these trusts sustained market losses during the second half of as a result  our net liabilities at december   increased substantially compared to the prior year 
we expect expenses related to these plans will increase in as a result of these market losses

revisions to estimated amounts related to contingent liabilities of our former operations  including those related to obligations under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the health benefit act  are recorded in discontinued operations

foreign operations we operate in approximately countries outside the us  each with a local currency other than the us dollar 
because our financial results are reported in us dollars  they are affected by changes in the value of various foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates may also affect transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
from time to time  we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge transactional risks associated with foreign currencies  as discussed in item a below 
at december   no foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding 
brink s venezuela is subject to local laws and regulatory interpretations that determine the exchange rate at which repatriating dividends may be converted 
see critical accounting policies foreign currency translation on page for a description of our accounting methods and assumptions used to include our venezuelan operation in our consolidated financial statements  and a description of the accounting for countries that are considered highly inflationary 
we are also subject to other risks customarily associated with doing business in foreign countries  including labor and economic conditions  political instability  controls on repatriation of earnings and capital  nationalization  expropriation and other forms of restrictive action by local governments

operating activities our operating cash flows decreased by million in compared to  primarily as a result of million less cash provided by our discontinued bhs operation  which only had ten months of operations in  as well as expenses for professional and legal fees to spin off the operation 
in addition  our continuing operations before voluntary contributions to our us retirement plans provided million less cash from operations than the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to higher professional  legal and advisory fees for shareholder initiatives  and higher cash usage for working capital needs  partially offset by higher segment operating profit 
we voluntarily contributed million to our primary us pension plan in  but we have not otherwise contributed cash to the plan since recent market conditions reduced the amount of assets in the trust used to pay plan benefits  and as a result  the plan was funded at the end of  compared to funded at the end of we are not required to make a contribution in under the minimum funding requirements of the pension protection act of ppa

we have included the projected cash flows in our contractual obligation table on page the amount of these required contributions may vary as they are subject to potential changes in asset values  discount rates on future obligations  assumed rates of return  and potential legislative action 
we may elect to make a discretionary contribution in  thereby reducing future expected contributions

in addition to this million decrease in cash outflow for  we had higher operating profit  lower working capital usage and lower cash used to pay income taxes

these amounts were instead paid by the veba 
this improved cash flows from operations in compared to because included million of direct benefit payments to retirees

the company also withheld a portion of the shares that were due to employees under deferred compensation distributions and stock option exercises 
the shares were withheld to meet the withholding requirements of million 
we made a scheduled payment of million in early related to our senior notes 
on march   we prepaid the outstanding million balance of the senior notes and made a make whole payment of million 
the senior notes were terminated upon prepayment 
in addition  we significantly reduced other debt during our operating liquidity needs are typically financed by short term debt and the revolving facility  described below

capitalization we use a combination of debt  leases and equity to capitalize our operations 
as of december   debt as a percentage of capitalization defined as total debt and shareholders equity was compared to at december  the increase resulted from a lower level of shareholders equity and the increase in debt of million 
equity decreased in primarily as a result of the spin off of bhs and other comprehensive losses associated with the declining value of assets held by retirement plans  partially offset by the generation of million in income from continuing operations

this supplemental non gaap information should be reviewed in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets 
our net debt cash position at december   as compared to december   decreased primarily due to million used for purchases of shares of our common stock  the million contributed to bhs prior to the spin off  partially offset by cash generated from operating activities  net of investing activities 
debt we have an unsecured million revolving bank credit facility the revolving facility with a syndicate of banks 
the revolving facility s interest rate is based on libor plus a margin  prime rate  or competitive bid 
the revolving facility allows us to borrow or otherwise satisfy credit needs on a revolving basis over a five year term ending in august as of december   million was available under the revolving facility 
amounts outstanding under the revolving facility were denominated primarily in us dollars and lesser amounts in canadian dollars as of december  the margin on libor borrowings under the revolving facility which can range from to  depending on our credit rating  was at december  when borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving facility are in excess of million  the applicable interest rate is increased by or 
we also pay an annual facility fee on the revolving facility based on the our credit rating 
the facility fee  which can range from to  was at the end of on july   we entered into a definitive agreement for a new unsecured million letter of credit facility with a bank the letter of credit facility that became effective in the third quarter of this replaced a previous million letter of credit facility that was terminated in the third quarter of the letter of credit facility expires in july as of december   million was available under the letter of credit facility 
the revolving facility and the multi currency revolving credit facilities described below are also used for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees 
we have two unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities with a total of million in available credit  of which approximately million was available at december  interest on these facilities is based on libor plus a margin 
the margin ranges from to 
a million facility expires in december and a million facility expires in december we also have the ability to borrow from other banks under short term uncommitted agreements 
various foreign subsidiaries maintain other lines of credit and overdraft facilities with a number of banks 
the revolving facility  the letter of credit facility and the two unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities contain subsidiary guarantees 
the revolving facility  the letter of credit facility and the multi currency revolving bank credit facilities also contain various financial and other covenants 
the financial covenants  among other things  limit our total indebtedness  limit asset sales  limit the use of proceeds from asset sales and provide for minimum coverage of interest costs 
the credit agreements do not provide for the acceleration of payments should our credit rating be reduced 
if we were not to comply with the terms of our various loan agreements  the repayment terms could be accelerated and the commitments could be withdrawn 
an acceleration of the repayment terms under one agreement could trigger the acceleration of the repayment terms under the other loan agreements 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december  we have guaranteed million of bonds issued by the peninsula ports authority of virginia 
the guarantee originated as part of a former interest in dominion terminal associates  a deep water coal terminal 
we continue to pay interest on and guarantee payment of the million principal amount and ultimately we will have to pay for the retirement of the bonds in accordance with the terms of the guarantee 
the bonds bear a fixed interest rate of and mature in the bonds may mature prior to upon the occurrence of specified events such as the determination that the bonds are taxable or if we fail to abide by the terms of its guarantee 
based on our current cash on hand  amounts available under our credit facilities and current projections of cash flows from operations  we believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs for more than the next months 
equity at december   we had million shares of common stock authorized and million shares issued and outstanding 
share purchases program 
on september   our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of our outstanding common shares 
the repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date 
under the program  we used million to purchase  shares of common stock between december   and may   at an average price of per share 
we used an additional million to purchase  shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of  at an average price of per share 
through february   we used an additional million to purchase  shares of common stock at an average price of per share 
as of february   we had million under this program available to purchase shares 
program 
following the self tender offer  the board authorized additional company common stock purchases of up to million from time to time as market conditions warranted and as covenants under existing agreements permitted 
the program did not require any specific number of shares be purchased 
under the program  we used million to purchase  shares of common stock between may and october   at an average price of per share 
we have no remaining authority under this program 
dutch auction on march   our board of directors authorized a dutch auction self tender offer to purchase up to million shares of our common stock 
under certain circumstances up to an additional of the outstanding common stock was authorized to be purchased in the tender offer 
the tender offer began on march   and expired on april   and was subject to the terms and conditions described in the offering materials mailed to our shareholders and filed with the securities and exchange commission 
on april   we purchased  shares in the tender offer at per share for a total of approximately million in cash 
we incurred million in costs associated with the purchase 
dividends we paid regular quarterly dividends on our common stock during the last three years 
on january   the board declared a regular quarterly dividend of cents per share payable on march  future dividends are dependent on the earnings  financial condition  shareholder equity levels  cash flow and business requirements of the company  as determined by the board of directors 
employee benefits trust in september  we terminated the brink s company employee benefits trust the employee benefits trust 
immediately prior to termination  the shares held by the trust were distributed to us and the shares were retired 
the purpose of the employee benefits trust prior to termination was to hold shares of our common stock to fund obligations under compensation and employee benefit programs that provided for the issuance of stock 
after the termination of the trust  newly issued shares are used to satisfy these programs 
through  shares of common stock were voted by the trustee in the same proportion as the shares of common stock voted by our employees participating in the company s k plan 
our k plan divested all shares of our common stock in january after the k plan divested all shares of company common stock  shares of the trust were not voted in matters voted on by shareholders 
preferred stock at december   we have the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
series a preferred stock rights agreement on september   the expiration date occurred under the amended and restated rights agreement  dated as of september   between us and american stock transfer trust company successor to equiserve trust company  na  as amended by amendment no 
thereto  dated september   between us and american stock transfer trust company the rights agreement 
as a result  the rights agreement and the rights issued thereunder expired by their own terms and each share of common stock  par value per share  of the company no longer is accompanied by a right to purchase  under certain circumstances  one one thousandth of a share of series a participating cumulative preferred stock of the company 
prior to expiration  the rights agreement gave holders of common stock the right to purchase series a participating cumulative preferred stock if  among other things  a third party accumulated more than of the voting rights of all outstanding common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note for operating leases that have residual value guarantees or other terms that cause the agreement to be considered a variable interest 
we use operating leases to lower our cost of financings 
we believe that operating leases are an important component of our capital structure 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december estimated payments due by period later in millions years total contractual obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations service contracts other other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap workers compensation and other claims primary us pension plan other retirement obligations umwa plans black lung and other plans uncertain tax positions other total pension obligations recent market losses reduced the amount of plan assets used to pay benefits of our primary us pension plan 
the contractual obligation table above includes the required contributions to comply with the minimum funding requirements of the pension protection act of based on actuarial assumptions at the end of the amount of these required contributions may vary as they are subject to potential changes in asset values  discount rates on future obligations  assumed rates of return  and potential legislative action 
we may elect to make voluntary accelerate contributions to achieve certain threshold funding levels 
other retirement obligations umwa plans 
in  we began using the assets of the veba to fund the majority of the benefit payments required under our united mine workers of america retirement medical plans 
the veba plan assets sustained market losses during  and the market value of these assets was million at the end of based on our funding assumptions as of december   we project that the veba will be able to pay benefits of the plans for the next eleven years 
as a result  we have excluded payments from the contractual obligations table during that period 
payments made by the veba are expected to range from million to million in each of these years 
we have included projected payments from corporate funds in the table for these plans after the next eleven years 
there are currently no plans to make voluntary contributions to the veba 
the company and certain current and former subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable for approximately million of retirement obligations 
this amount is a portion of the amount that we have included in our financial statements  and is not reduced for amounts that have been contributed to the veba 
the company has indemnified bhs and the purchasers of bax global and natural resources assets for their contingent obligation 
black lung and other plans 
the contractual obligations table includes payments projected to be paid with our corporate funds  including payments for black lung benefits of former employees and health benefits of former salaried employees 
these benefits cannot be paid with funds from the veba 
uncertain tax positions at december   we have unrecognized tax benefits of million for uncertain tax positions  pursuant to fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas approximately million of the total amount is reasonably possible to be settled within one year 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of other amounts 
surety bonds and letters of credit we are required by various state and federal laws to provide security with regard to our obligations to pay workers compensation benefits  reclaim lands used for mining by our former coal operations and satisfy other obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding surety bonds with third parties totaling approximately million that we have arranged in order to satisfy various security requirements 
most of these bonds provide financial security for obligations which have already been recorded as liabilities 
surety bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis  however  there can be no assurance the bonds will be renewed or that premiums in the future will not increase 
we believe that we have adequate available borrowing capacity under our letter of credit facility and our revolving facility to provide letters of credit or other collateral to secure our obligations if the remaining surety bonds are not renewed 
we have issued letters of credit totaling million under our letter of credit facility  described in debt above 
at december   all of these issued letters of credit were being used to secure various obligations 
contingent matters income tax we are subject to tax examinations in various us and foreign jurisdictions 
we have approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits at december  the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits has been measured in accordance with fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas fin 
the amount of tax benefits ultimately recognized for open tax periods at december   will depend on the final outcome of the various issues that may arise during an examination  and the tax benefit recognized may be materially different from that amount as measured under fin former operations bax global  a former business unit  is defending a claim related to the apparent diversion by a third party of goods being transported for a customer 
although bax global is defending this claim vigorously and believes that its defenses have merit  it is possible that this claim ultimately may be decided in favor of the claimant 
if so  we expect that the ultimate amount of reasonably possible unaccrued losses could range from to million 
we have contractually indemnified the purchaser of bax global for this contingency 
value added taxes vat and customs duties during  we determined that one of our non us brink s business units had not paid customs duties and vat with respect to the importation of certain goods and services 
we were advised that civil and criminal penalties could be asserted for the non payment of these customs duties and vat 
although no penalties have been asserted to date  they could be asserted at any time 
the business unit has provided the appropriate government authorities with an accounting of unpaid customs duties and vat and has made payments covering its calculated unpaid vat 
we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses is between million and million for potential penalties on unpaid vat and have accrued million 
we believe that the range of possible losses for unpaid customs duties and associated penalties  none of which has been accrued  is between and million 
we believe that the assertion of the penalties on unpaid customs duties would be excessive and would vigorously defend against any such assertion 
we do not expect to be assessed interest charges in connection with any penalties that may be asserted 
we continue to diligently pursue the timely resolution of this matter and  accordingly  we estimate of the potential losses could change materially in future periods 
the assertion of potential penalties may be material to our financial position and results of operations 
other we are involved in various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
we are not able to estimate the range of losses for some of these matters 
we have recorded accruals for losses that are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies the application of accounting principles requires the use of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
we make assumptions  estimates and judgments based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes  similarly situated businesses and  when appropriate  the opinions of advisors with relevant knowledge and experience 
reported results could have been materially different had management used a different set of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets result primarily from net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes  as determined under enacted tax laws and rates 
accounting policies we establish valuation allowances in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  when we estimate it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
we decide to record valuation allowances primarily based on an assessment of historical earnings and future taxable income that incorporates prudent  feasible tax planning strategies 
we assess deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
changes in tax statutes  the timing of deductibility of expenses or expectations for future performance could result in material adjustments to our valuation allowances  which would increase or decrease tax expense 
our valuation allowances are as follows 
valuation allowances december  in millions us federal state non us total a a includes million of valuation allowances in related to bhs 
application of accounting policies us deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets before valuation allowances increased significantly in primarily as a result of higher us retirement obligations 
we expect that future taxable income of our us operations will not be sufficient to realize the entire benefit from the future tax deductions associated with these obligations 
we therefore have concluded that approximately million of us federal and state net deferred tax assets will not be realized and we have provided a valuation allowance for these assets in other comprehensive income loss  in accordance with sfas also  we concluded that it is uncertain whether we will be able to realize certain deferred tax assets that we had recognized at the beginning of due to current and future expected losses at the state level 
as a result  we established additional valuation allowances of approximately million in through continuing operations 
non us deferred tax assets due to recent improvements in operating results in certain non us jurisdictions and our favorable outlook that future operating performance will be sufficiently profitable to realize the deferred tax assets  we reversed approximately million of valuation allowances in through continuing operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment valuations accounting policies at december   we had property and equipment of million  goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we review these assets for possible impairment using the guidance in sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  for goodwill and sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  for other intangible assets and property and equipment 
our review for impairment requires the use of significant judgments about the future performance of our operating subsidiaries 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimates of the fair value of these assets  differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the impairment analyses 
application of accounting policies goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if impairment is indicated 
due to a history of profitability and cash flow generation along with expectations for future cash flows  no impairment of goodwill has been identified 
other intangible assets and property and equipment we review long lived assets besides goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
for purposes of assessing impairment  assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
to determine whether an impairment has occurred  we compare estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying value 
we recognized a million impairment charge in prior to selling a portion of our united kingdom operation 
we have had no other significant impairments of property and equipment in the last three years 
retirement benefit obligations we provide benefits through defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical benefit plans and under statutory requirements eg  black lung and workers compensation obligations 
accounting policy we account for retirement benefit obligations under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as amended  sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as amended  sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  and sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
and the primary benefits are accounted for as follows pension obligations sfas  as amended by sfas other retiree obligations sfas  as amended by sfas workers compensation obligations sfas to account for these benefits  we make assumptions of expected return on assets  discount rates  inflation  demographic factors and changes in the laws and regulations covering the benefit obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of these items and because the obligations are significant  changes in the assumptions could have a material effect on our liabilities and expenses related to these benefits 
our most significant retirement plans include our primary us pension plan and the retiree medical plans of our former coal business that were collectively bargained with the united mine workers of america the umwa 
the critical accounting estimates that determine the carrying values of liabilities and the resulting annual expense are discussed below 
application of accounting policy discount rate assumptions for plans accounted under sfas and sfas for plans accounted under sfas and sfas  we discount estimated future payments using discount rates based on market conditions at the end of the year 
in general  our liability changes in an inverse relationship to interest rates  ie the lower the discount rate  the higher the associated plan obligation 
the discount rate used to measure the present value of our benefit obligations was derived using the cash flow matching method 
under this method  we compare the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yields on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with similar expected payment streams 
each year s projected cash flows are then discounted back to their present value at the measurement date and an overall discount rate is determined 
we changed our method of estimating our discount rate for our us plans in in  an average of the discount rates calculated using mercer yield curve and the citigroup pension discount curve was selected and was rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point 
in  we simplified our method to use only the mercer yield curve  rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point 
the discount rate in determined using our new method would not have changed if we had used our prior method 
prior to  we selected a discount rate for our plan obligations after reviewing published long term yield information for a small number of high quality fixed income securities eg moody s aa bond yields 
our advisors also calculated yields for the broader range of long term high quality securities with maturities in line with expected payments 
the discount rates for the us pension plans and retiree medical plans were at december   at december   and at december  the discount rates for the black lung obligations were at december   at december  and at december  the average discount rates for plans outside the us were at december   at december   and at december  sensitivity analysis the discount rate we select at year end affects the valuations of plan obligations at year end and calculations of net periodic expenses for the following year 
the tables below compare hypothetical plan obligation valuations for our largest plans as of december   actual expenses for and projected expenses for assuming we had used discount rates that were one percentage point lower or higher 
plan obligations at december  hypothetical actual hypothetical in millions primary us pension plan umwa plans actual and projected expense income in millions  except percentages hypothetical sensitivity analysis for discount rate assumption hypothetical sensitivity analysis for discount rate assumption actual lower higher projected lower higher years ending december  discount rate assumption primary us pension plan a umwa plans a expense includes continuing and discontinued operations 
expected return on assets assumption for plans accounted under sfas and sfas our expected return on assets assumption  which affects our net periodic benefit cost  reflects the long term average rate of return we expect the plan assets to earn 
we select the expected return on assets assumption using advice from our investment advisor and actuary considering each plan s asset allocation targets and expected overall investment manager performance and a review of the most recent long term historical average compounded rates of return  as applicable 
we selected as the expected return on assets assumption as of december  and over the last ten years  the annual returns of our primary us pension plan have averaged  on a compounded basis   net of fees  while the year compounded annual return averaged and the year compounded annual return averaged 
sensitivity analysis effect of using different expected rate of return assumptions 
our and projected expense would have been different if we had used different expected rate of return assumptions 
for every hypothetical change of one percentage point in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and holding other assumptions constant  our and expense would be as follows 
in millions  except percentages hypothetical sensitivity analysis for expected return on asset assumption hypothetical sensitivity analysis for expected return on asset assumption actual lower higher projected lower higher years ending december  expected return on asset assumption primary us pension plan a umwa plans a expense includes continuing and discontinued operations 
effect of improving or deteriorating actual future market returns 
our funded status at december   and our expense will be different from currently projected amounts if our projected returns are better or worse than the return we have assumed 
in millions  except percentages hypothetical sensitivity analysis of asset return better or worse than expected better worse years ending december  projected return return return on investments in funded status at december  primary us pension plan umwa plans expense primary us pension plan a umwa plans a expense includes continuing and discontinued operations 
effect of using fair market value of assets to determine expense 
for our plans accounted for under sfas  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market related value of plan assets 
in addition  our plan asset actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization are based on the market related value 
the market related value of the plan assets is different from the actual or fair market value of the assets 
the actual or fair market value is the value of the assets at a point in time that is available to make payments to pensioners and to cover any transaction costs 
the market related value recognizes changes in fair value from the expected value on a straight line basis over five years 
this recognition method spreads the effects of year over year volatility in the financial markets over several years 
our expenses related to our primary us pension plan would have been different if our accounting policy were to use the fair market value of plan assets instead of the market related value to recognize investment gains and losses 
in millions based on market related value of assets hypothetical a actual projected projected years ending december  expense income primary us pension plan b a assumes that our accounting policy was to use the fair market value of assets instead of the market related value of assets to determine our expense relatedto our primary us pension plan 
b expense includes continuing and discontinued operations 
for our umwa plans  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the fair market value of the assets at the beginning of the year 
this method is likely to cause the credit to earnings from the expected return on assets to fluctuate more than the similar credit using the accounting methodology of plans accounted for under sfas medical inflation assumption for plans accounted for under sfas we estimate the trend in health care cost inflation to predict future cash flows related to our retiree medical plans 
our assumption is based on recent plan experience and industry trends 
for the umwa plans  our major plans accounted for under sfas  we have assumed a medical inflation rate of for  and we project this rate to decline to by the average annual increase for medical inflation in the plan for the last five years has been below 
if we assumed that health care cost trend rates were one percentage point higher in each future year  the plan obligation for the umwa retiree medical benefit plan would have been approximately million higher at december   and the expense for would have been million higher 
if we had assumed that the future health care cost trend rate would be one percentage point lower  the plan obligation would have been approximately million lower at december   and the related expenses would have been million lower 
workers compensation besides the effects of changes in medical costs  worker s compensation costs are affected by the severity and types of injuries  changes in state and federal regulations and their application and the quality of programs which assist an employee s return to work 
our liability for future payments for workers compensation claims is evaluated annually with the assistance of an actuary 
numbers of participants the valuations of all of these benefit plans are affected by the life expectancy of the participants 
accordingly  we rely on actuarial information to predict the number and life expectancy of participants 
we use the following mortality table for our major plans 
plan mortality table umwa plans rp employee  annuitant healthy blue collar black lung rp blue collar primary us pension rp combined healthy blue collar the number of participants by major plan is as follows plan number of participants umwa plans black lung other primary us pension since the company is no longer operating in the coal industry  it anticipates that the number of participants in the umwa retirement medical plan and the number of participants receiving benefits under black lung regulations will decline over time due to mortality 
since the us pension plan has been frozen  the number of its participants should also decline over time 
foreign currency translation the majority of our subsidiaries outside the us conduct business in their local currencies 
our financials report results in us dollars  which include the results of these subsidiaries translated using currency exchange rates 
accounting policy assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using rates of exchange at the balance sheet date 
translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
revenues and expenses are translated at rates of exchange in effect during the year 
transaction gains and losses are recorded in net income 
application of accounting policy dual exchange rates most of the countries in which our subsidiaries conduct business have one recognized  market based currency exchange rate 
we use these rates to prepare our financial statements 
in venezuela  however  there are two currency exchange rates which may be used to convert local currency into other currencies an official currency exchange rate and a market rate 
the use of the official currency exchange rate to convert dividends into other currencies requires the approval of the government s currency control organization 
the market rate  which has historically been substantially lower than the official rate  may be used to obtain other currencies without the approval of the currency control organization 
for our venezuelan subsidiaries  we prepare our financial statements using the official currency exchange rate  which was bolivar fuerte to the us dollar at december  we use the official currency exchange rate because we expect that we will be able to obtain our dividends from venezuelan operations at this rate 
reported results would have been adversely affected if revenues  operating profits and net assets of brink s venezuela had been reported using the market currency exchange rate 
brink s venezuela held net assets of million at december   including net monetary assets of million 
highly inflationary accounting although we do not operate in any countries that are considered highly inflationary  which is defined as cumulative inflation rates exceeding in the most recent three year period  it is reasonably possible this may occur in the future 
venezuela s economy has not been considered to be highly inflationary in the past five years  but it is reasonably possible that venezuela s economy may be considered highly inflationary again at some time in the future 
subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary countries use the us dollar as the functional currency  and local currency monetary assets are remeasured into u 
s dollars  with remeasurement adjustments and other transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements adopted standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosure of fair value measurements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the company adopted sfas  effective january   for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the implementation of sfas  as it relates to the company s financial assets and financial liabilities did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position  partial deferral of the effective date of sfas  which delayed the effective date of sfas for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until january  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  on its nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
the company adopted sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 effective january  sfas permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the fair value option 
unrealized gains and losses  arising subsequent to the election of the fair value option  are reported in earnings 
the company did not elect the fair value option for any existing assets or liabilities upon adoption 
therefore  the implementation of sfas did not have an effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company adopted fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas  effective january  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the adoption of this interpretation increased retained earnings at january   by million 
the company adopted sfas r  share based payment  effective january  prior to adopting sfas r  the company accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  as permitted by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  the predecessor to sfas r 
under the intrinsic value method no share based compensation cost was recognized as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
sfas r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the fair value of those awards 
in addition  sfas r requires additional accounting and disclosures for the income tax and cash flow effects of share based payment arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations have activities in approximately countries 
these operations expose the company to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial and commodity exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company periodically uses various derivative and non derivative financial instruments  as discussed below  to hedge its interest rate  commodity prices and foreign currency exposures when appropriate 
the risk that counterparties to these instruments may be unable to perform is minimized by limiting the counterparties used to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings 
the company does not expect to incur a loss from the failure of any counterparty to perform under the agreements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging underlying financial or commercial exposures 
the sensitivity analyses discussed below for the market risk exposures were based on the facts and circumstances in effect at december  actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not under management s control and could vary materially from those disclosed 
interest rate risk the company uses both fixed and floating rate debt and leases to finance its operations 
floating rate obligations  including the company s revolving facility  expose the company to fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in the general level of interest rates 
fixed rate obligations  including the company s dominion terminal associates debt  are subject to fluctuations in fair values as a result of changes in interest rates 
based on the contractual interest rates on the floating rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in rates would increase cash outflows by approximately million over a twelve month period 
in other words  the company s weighted average interest rate on its floating rate instruments was per annum at december  if that average rate were to increase by percentage points to  the cash outflows associated with these instruments would increase by million annually 
the effect on the fair value of the company s dominion terminal associates debt for a hypothetical decrease in the yield curve from year end levels would result in a million increase in the fair value of this debt 
foreign currency risk the company has exposure to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the results of all of its foreign operations 
the company s foreign operations generally use local currencies to conduct business but their results are reported in us dollars 
the company is exposed periodically to the foreign currency rate fluctuations that affect transactions not denominated in the functional currency of domestic and foreign operations 
to mitigate these exposures  the company  from time to time  enters into foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   no foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries since such investments are long term in nature 
the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous appreciation in the us dollar from year end levels against all other currencies of countries in which the company has continuing operations are as follows hypothetical effects in millions increase decrease translation of earnings into us dollars a transactional exposures a translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries b a reflected in the consolidated statements of income 
b reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 
the hypothetical foreign currency effects above detail the consolidated impact of a simultaneous change in the value of a large number of foreign currencies relative to the u 
s 
dollar 
the foreign currency exposure impact related to a change in an individual currency could be significantly different
