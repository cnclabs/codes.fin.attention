overview axcelis technologies  inc axcelis  the company  we  us  or our  is a worldwide producer of equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors 
in addition  the company provides extensive aftermarket service and support  including spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services to the semiconductor industry 
until march   the company owned of the equity of a joint venture with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
shi in japan 
this joint venture  which is known as sen corporation  an shi and axcelis company sen  licensed technology from the company relating to the manufacture of specified ion implantation products and had exclusive rights to manufacture and sell these products in the territory of japan 
sen is the leading producer of ion implantation equipment in japan 
upon the sale of the company s investment in sen  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
axcelis and sen entered into a new license agreement which allows each company to continue to use certain patents and technical information owned by the other to make and sell ion implant systems on a worldwide  royalty free  perpetual basis 
as a result of the sale  sen is free to make and sell the licensed products worldwide  creating a new global competitor for axcelis 
axcelis will need to use its established customer relations and infrastructure outside of japan as well as the technical advantages of the optima hd and optima xe to compete against sen as well as our existing competitors 
prior to the release of the optima product line  we regularly licensed sen to make and sell our implant systems in japan 
axcelis is now able to compete against sen in japan with all axcelis products 
to do so  axcelis needs to either expand and develop its own customer relations and infrastructure in japan or contract with a third party to sell and support implanters in japan 
if axcelis is not able to compete effectively with sen  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  on january   axcelis failed to make the required payment of approximately million under an indenture dated as of may  the indenture between axcelis and us bank national association  as trustee  relating to the company s convertible senior subordinated notes 
on february   axcelis  shi and sen entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant to which  on march   sold its shares in sen to shi for million net of advisory fees and expenses 
a portion of the net proceeds was used to discharge  in full  the company s obligations under the indenture 
the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to significant cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them  the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology  all of which are outside of our control 
as a result  our revenues and gross margins  to the extent affected by increases or decreases in volume  could fluctuate from year to year and period to period 
the industry experienced a downturn beginning in the second half of which extended through and is expected to continue at least through our gross margins are also affected by the introduction of new products 
we typically become more efficient in manufacturing products as they mature 
our expense base is largely fixed and does not vary significantly with changes in volume 
therefore  we could experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenues as driven by the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the sizable expense of building  upgrading or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is increasingly causing semiconductor companies to contract with foundries to manufacture their semiconductors 
in addition  consolidation and partnering within the semiconductor manufacturing industry is increasing 
we expect these trends to continue to reduce the number of our potential customers 
this growing concentration of axcelis customers may increase competitive pricing as higher percentages of our total revenues are tied to the buying decisions of a particular customer or a small number of customers 
in both and  we incurred net losses 
beginning in  most customers shifted from multi wafer tools to single wafer tools for high current ion implant applications 
because we did not have a single wafer high current product  we have experienced a significant loss of market share which we have yet to regain 
we introduced our single wafer optima hd for high current applications product in and have begun to gain traction with this tool at a number of customers through evaluation arrangements 
as of december   revenue of approximately million has been recognized on sales of the optima hd 
during the last four months of  our stock price dropped significantly below book value 
our inability to repay our outstanding debt in january and our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to support ongoing operations  have adversely impacted our stock price 
as mentioned above  we have lost significant market share in high current ion implant the largest market segment in ion implant over the past several years 
we believe that we now have competitive products in the high current and high energy ion implant market segments  as well as dry strip 
however  challenging market conditions have severely limited our ability to increase sales and market share 
additionally  in concert with the market uncertainty resulting from the current credit crisis  we believe that the economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment and lower consumer spending  has severely impacted many technology manufacturers and has significantly lowered the demand for our products 
the company believes that a combination of these factors accounts for the difference between our stock trading price and our book value 
in addition  the estimated future total available market for our products  as published by independent third party industry analysts  was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter and we experienced a decline as compared to aftermarket revenue in the third quarter of in our aftermarket business  reflecting significant declines in manufacturers capacity utilization 
this fourth quarter contraction in the industry led us to revise our short term and long term financial forecasts 
as a result  we recorded charges in the fourth quarter of for the impairment of intangible and long lived assets of million  impairment of goodwill of million  and excess inventory of million 
continuing capital market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us because we are dependent on customer behavior 
our revenues would likely continue to decline in such circumstances and our profit margins would continue to erode 
in addition  as a result of extreme prolonged events  such as the global credit crisis  we could incur significant losses 
factors such as consumer spending  business investment  and the volatility and strength of the capital markets all affect the business and economic environment  and ultimately  the amount of profitability of our business 
continuing adverse trends in the economy would likely affect our earnings negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
axcelis liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these factors are based on normal operations of the business  including acceptance of the optima product line  and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies  including the availability of credit  and the state of the semiconductor equipment industry 
although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  we believe that based on our current market  revenue and expense forecast our existing cash and cash equivalents and the net proceeds of the sale of our sen investment will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements at least through if the downturn in the semicap equipment industry continues into and our operating performance does not improve significantly as compared to the fourth quarter of  it could have a significant effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue in the future as a going concern 
operating results for the years presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future interim periods or years as a whole 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  accounts receivable  inventory and warranty obligations 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
as described below  we consider a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the complexity of the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  payment history  customer creditworthiness and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance  we may have to revise our revenue recognition policy  which could delay the timing of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
axcelis revenue transactions include sales of products under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to each element  except systems  based upon its estimated fair market value  in accordance with the provisions of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is calculated on a residual method 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements  with the residual amount being allocated to product revenue 
the value of the undelivered elements includes a the greater of i the fair value of the installation or ii the portion of the sales price that will not be received until the installation is completed the retention plus b the fair value of all other undelivered elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon the fair value of the service performed  including labor  which is based upon the estimated time to complete the installation at hourly rates  and material components 
the fair value of all other undelivered elements is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
product revenue for products which have demonstrated market acceptance legacy products  is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  prices are contractually fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
revenue from installation services is recognized at the time formal acceptance is received from the customer or  for certain customers  when both the formal acceptance and retention payment have been received 
revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed 
we generally recognize systems revenue for products which have demonstrated market acceptance legacy products  at the time of shipment because the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory 
the majority of axcelis systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer s specifications  as outlined in the contract between the customer and axcelis  which may be the axcelis standard specification 
to ensure that the customer s specifications are satisfied  many customers request that new systems be tested at axcelis facilities prior to shipment  normally with the customer present  under conditions that substantially replicate the customer s production environment and the customer s criteria are confirmed to have been met 
customers of mature products generally do not require pre shipment testing 
we believe the risk of failure to complete a system installation is remote 
should an installation not be completed successfully  the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture  refund or other purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the uniform commercial code applicable generally to such transactions 
for initial shipments of systems with new technologies or in the small number of instances where axcelis is unsure of meeting the customer s specifications or obtaining customer acceptance upon shipment of the system  axcelis will defer the recognition of systems revenue and related costs until written customer acceptance of the system is obtained 
this deferral period is generally within twelve months of shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts  or based on parts usage  where appropriate 
revenue related to service hours is recognized when the services are performed 
royalty revenue is primarily earned under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
royalty revenue is recorded at the time sen notifies the company that royalties have been earned 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more often if there are indicators of impairment present 
our annual test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year 
as a result of declining economic conditions  along with our stock price below book value  we also performed an interim test at september   concluding that goodwill was not impaired 
the provisions of sfas require that a two step impairment test be performed for goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test and determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
our annual test was performed during the fourth quarter of during this period  the significant decline in our stock price experienced at the end of the third quarter continued through the end of the fourth quarter and beyond  resulting in a sustained market capitalization well below book value 
in addition  the estimated future total available market for our products  as published by independent third party industry analysts  was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter and we experienced a decline as compared to aftermarket revenues in the third quarter of in our aftermarket business  reflecting significant declines in manufacturers capacity utilization 
this fourth quarter contraction in the industry led us to revise our short term and long term financial forecast 
our updated long term financial forecast represents the best estimate that our management has at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable 
sfas requires that we measure goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the company has one operating segment as defined by sfas and disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   goodwill was evaluated for impairment at the component level  which is one level below the operating segment 
as such  the cleaning and curing product line was considered the reporting unit  for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment 
the impairment analysis utilized a discounted cash flow method and assumed a cash flow period of years based on management s updated projections for years and an additional years based on additional projections and historical performance 
the underlying assumptions in this year forecast contemplate increased market share above current levels  improvement to gross margins while managing operating expenses at current levels 
we utilized the gordon growth method based upon a discount rate of less the estimated growth rate of 
a variance in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the assessment as to whether goodwill may or may not be impaired 
based on the result of our impairment assessment of goodwill  we determined that the carrying value of our cleaning and curing product line exceeded its estimated fair value 
therefore  we performed the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied value of goodwill 
we allocated the estimated fair value of our cleaning and curing product line as determined in the first step to recognized and unrecognized net assets  including allocations to intangible assets 
the result of our analysis indicated that there would be no remaining implied value attributable to goodwill in our cleaning and curing product line and accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million as of december  estimates and assumptions used in the determination of fair value for the cleaning and curing product line include revenue growth rates and operating margins 
these are used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determining appropriate market comparables 
we believe these assumptions to be reasonable but actual conditions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from out estimates 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the carrying value of intangible and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as a result of declining economic conditions  along with our stock price below book value  we performed an interim test at september   concluding that intangible and long lived assets were not impaired 
the significant decline in our stock price experienced at the end of the third quarter continued through the end of the fourth quarter and beyond  resulting in a sustained market capitalization well below book value 
in addition  the estimated future total available market for our products  as published by independent third party industry analysts  was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter and we experienced a decline as compared to aftermarket revenue in the third quarter of in our aftermarket business  reflecting significant declines in manufacturers capacity utilization 
this fourth quarter contraction in the industry led us to revise our short term and long term financial forecasts 
our updated financial forecast represents the best estimate that our management has at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value was based on a probability weighted cash flow forecast  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved in achieving the forecasted cash flows 
see notes    and to the accompanying financial statements for further detail on impairment of intangible and long lived assets 
the estimates of future operating results and cash flows are derived from our updated long term financial forecast 
this updated long term forecast represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable based primarily on current product performance and customer acceptance 
this forecast relies primarily on market assumptions and market share we expect to achieve 
however  actual performance in the near term and longer term could be materially different from these forecasts  which could impact future estimates of undiscounted cash flows and may result in the impairment of the carrying amount of long lived assets 
this could be caused by events such as strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
accordingly  we will continue to perform this analysis no less than quarterly for the foreseeable future 
as a result of this review  we recorded a total intangible assets and long lived asset impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter ended december  this charge consisted of intangibles of million  certain other assets of million and property  plant and equipment of million 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts axcelis records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of axcelis customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory allowance for excess and obsolescence axcelis records an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is determined using management s assumptions of materials usage  based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
with the downward revisions in the fourth quarter of the estimated future total available market for our products  we revised our revenue forecasts through based on the revised forecasts and expected inventory usages over the next two years  we increased the excess and obsolete inventory reserve by million as of december  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts or product demand and pricing assumptions  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  pricing  or technical developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if the company finds that estimates are too optimistic and determine that inventory needs to be written down further  the company will recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
product warranty axcelis offers a one to three year product warranty  the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold 
for all systems sold  we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the fair value of non standard warranty 
costs for non standard warranty are expensed as incurred 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue product service royalties  primarily from sen total revenue cost of revenue product services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill impairment of intangibles and long lived assets amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense equity income loss of sen interest income interest expense other  net total other income expense income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue revenues declined significantly in compared to and based on current industry projections are expected to decline further in the continuing decline in market conditions is expected to have a negative impact on both revenues from system sales and revenues from the company s aftermarket business 
product product revenue  which includes systems sales  sales of spare parts and product upgrades  was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue in product revenue in and has been reduced by our loss of high current market share  as discussed above 
the decline in product revenue in is also attributable to a weakening semiconductor market and a related decrease in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
in addition  a decrease in capacity expansion at mm manufacturing facilities a portion of which relates to the overall decline in the semiconductor capital equipment market decreased revenue from system sales by million for approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and was from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
despite our results  general market trends for the past several years highlight a growth in sales toward mm products and a decrease in expansion of facilities using mm products 
a portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decline was mainly due to the decrease in overall systems revenue in and the recognition of million of revenue deferred in related to the rollout of the optima hd product line 
service service revenue  which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on site service personnel  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue  for although service revenue should increase with the expansion of the installed base of systems  it can fluctuate period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities  which affects the need for equipment service 
royalties royalty revenue was million or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for royalties are earned primarily under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
changes are mainly attributable to fluctuations in sen sales volume based on demand for equipment by japanese semiconductor manufacturers and the timing of shipments in japan 
in connection with the sale of the company s investment in sen see note to the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to march  sen will have no obligation to pay royalties to the company 
ion implant revenue from sales of ion implantation products and service accounted for million  or of total revenue in  compared with million  or  of total revenue in the decline was due to the factors discussed above 
annual revenue from the sale of ion implantation products and service typically average from to of total revenues 
aftermarket the company s product revenues include sales of spare parts and product upgrades as well as complete systems 
we refer to the business of selling spare parts and product upgrades  combined with the sale of maintenance labor and service contracts and service hours as the aftermarket business 
the revenue from our aftermarket business was million for  compared to million for aftermarket revenue generally increases with expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service 
the estimated future total available market for our products  as published by independent third party industry analysts  was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter and we experienced a decline as compared to aftermarket revenues in the third quarter of  in our aftermarket business  reflecting significant declines in manufacturers capacity utilization 
the decline of aftermarket revenue has continued through the first quarter of gross profit product gross profit from product revenue was for  compared to for  a decrease of 
approximately of the decrease pertains to an additional reserve of million for excess inventory 
the remaining decrease is attributable to the significantly lower system sales volume during the year 
these amounts were offset by the favorable impact of an increased mix of parts and upgrade revenue at higher margins 
service gross profit from service revenue was for  compared to for the increase in gross profit is attributable to service pricing increases enacted during the first quarter of driving a higher mix of profitable service support agreements and lower expenses against fixed price support contracts 
research and development research and development expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared with million in the decrease was driven primarily by completion of optima and integra platform development decreased professional fee expenses million  decreased payroll costs million and decreased project material costs million  offset by increased development asset amortization and depreciation costs million 
research and development expense was attributable to the following activities for for new product development  for improvement of existing products  and for product testing 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared with million in the decrease was driven primarily by decreased payroll costs million  decreased professional services million  decreased commissions expenses million  decreased travel costs million  decreased marketing communications costs million and decreased training and supplies costs million  offset by increased costs related to evaluation system support for our optima platform million 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million  compared with million in the increase was driven primarily by increased variable compensation costs of million and increased professional fee expenses million offset by lower payroll costs of million  lower stock compensation costs million and lower travel costs million 
impairment of goodwill our annual test was performed during the fourth quarter of during this period  the significant decline in our stock price experienced at the end of the third quarter continued through the end of the fourth quarter and beyond  resulting in a sustained market capitalization well below book value 
in addition  the estimated future total available market for our products  as published by independent third party industry analysts  was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter and we experienced a decline as compared to aftermarket revenue in the third quarter of  in our aftermarket business  reflecting significant declines in manufacturers capacity utilization 
this fourth quarter contraction in the industry led us to revise our short term and long term financial forecast 
our updated long term financial forecast represents the best estimate that our management has at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable 
based on the result of our impairment assessment of goodwill  we determined that the carrying value of our cleaning and curing product line exceeded its estimated fair value 
therefore  we performed the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied value of goodwill 
specifically  we allocated the estimated fair value of our cleaning and curing product line as determined in the first step to recognized and unrecognized net assets  including allocations to intangible assets such as developed technologies  in process research and development  customer relationships and trade names 
the result of our analysis indicated that there would be no remaining implied value attributable to goodwill and accordingly  we wrote off the entire book value of goodwill of million as of december  during the three month period ended september   we elected to discontinue future development of the rtp and curing product lines 
based on that business decision  the forecast of future cash flows was revised and  as such  in september a goodwill impairment loss of million was recorded 
the fair value of these product lines was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
impairment of intangibles and long lived assets the significant decline in our stock price experienced at the end of the third quarter continued through the end of the fourth quarter and beyond  resulting in a sustained market capitalization well below book value 
in addition  the estimated future total available market for our products  as published by independent third party industry analysts  was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter and we experienced a decline as compared to aftermarket revenue in the third quarter of  in our aftermarket business  reflecting significant declines in manufacturers capacity utilization 
this fourth quarter contraction in the industry led us to revise our short term and long term financial forecast 
our updated long term financial forecast represents the best estimate that our management has at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable 
as a result of our review of the recoverability of intangibles and long lived assets we recorded an impairment charge of million consisting of the entire net book value of intangible assets of million  certain other assets of million  and property  plant and equipment of million 
there was no impairment charge related to intangibles or long lived assets in stock based compensation expense total stock based compensation expense related to stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas r 
restructuring in may and october of  we implemented a reduction in force to further reduce costs to mitigate deteriorating industry fundamentals 
these reductions in force resulted in restructuring charges to expense of million and million respectively for separation and outplacement costs

changes in our restructuring liability  included in amounts reported as other current liabilities  are as follows severance in thousands balance at december  restructuring expense cash payments balance at december  other income expense equity loss attributable to sen was million for this is compared to equity income attributable to sen of million for fluctuations in equity income from sen reflect changes in its sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market  and the timing of shipments in japan 
in connection with the sale of the company s investment in sen see note to the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to march  the company will no longer record equity income or loss from sen 
interest income of million for  primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income decreased by million from  due primarily to lower average cash balances 
interest expense of million in  an increase of million from  relates primarily to the outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes which have an effective yield to maturity of 
the increase in interest expense in relates to the accretion of the premium due at maturity 
income taxes credits we incur income tax expense relating principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  we do not currently pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions and we do not recognize the tax benefit for such losses as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful

this reduction in force was expected to result in a total charge to expense of approximately million related to separation and outplacement costs  of which million was recorded in the statement of operations at december  changes in our restructuring liability  included in amounts reported as other current liabilities  are as follows severance leases total in thousands balance at december  restructuring expense cash payments balance at december  the lease restructuring liability relates to the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into its headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts during these leases were paid over the remaining lease term  which ended december  other income expense equity income attributable to sen was million in compared to million in fluctuations in equity income from sen reflect changes in its sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market  and the timing of shipments in japan 
interest income of million for primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income decreased by million from due primarily to lower average cash balances  resulting from the repayment of million of long term debt in january interest expense of million in  a decrease of million from  relates primarily to the outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes which have an effective yield to maturity of 
the decrease in interest expense in is a direct result of the repayment of million of long term debt in january income taxes credits income tax expense for was million 
in  we determined that certain tax reserves relating to a previous tax year were no longer required 
as a result  we recorded an adjustment to reduce income tax expense by million 
in addition  during the year we recorded tax benefits related to the realization of foreign tax credits  which we expected to recover approximately million in tax refunds of amounts paid for alternative minimum taxes remitted for tax years through liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have no significant capital projects planned for and total capital expenditures for are projected to be less than million 
future capital expenditures beyond will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of expansion of our business and our ability to generate cash to fund them 
the following represents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter short term debt including interest purchase order commitments operating leases amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total thereafter standby letters of credit guarantees we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  our liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these relate specifically to the operations of our business  for example  the rate of acceptance of the optima product line  and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies  including the availability of credit  and the condition of the overall semiconductor equipment industry 
during  we experienced negative cash flows from operations 
cash used for operations in was predominately driven by the net loss from operations attributable to the depressed semiconductor equipment market and the resultant decline in revenues 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million at december  the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents is mainly attributable to cash used by operations million and capital expenditures million offset by a decrease of restricted cash balances of million 
we also anticipate significant cash outflows from operations throughout however  we believe that based on our current market  revenue and expense forecasts our existing cash and cash equivalents and the net proceeds from the sale of our sen investment will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements at least through our forecast reflects revenue and gross margins  excluding nonrecurring charges  consistent with amounts realized in the fourth quarter of and operating expense levels that reflect cost saving initiatives implemented during if the downturn in the semicap equipment industry continues into and our operating performance does not improve significantly as compared to the fourth quarter of  it could have a significant effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue in the future as a going concern 
our cash position will also be driven by reductions in working capital  as inventory for the optima product line is converted into revenue 
on march   pursuant to the share purchase agreement with shi and sen  we sold all of our common shares in sen to shi for net proceeds of million 
we used million of that amount to pay in full our outstanding obligations on our convertible senior subordinated notes 
after payment of our debt  our unrestricted cash balance at march  was approximately million 
we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax effect of which aggregate million at december  these carryforwards  which expire principally between and  are available to reduce future income tax liabilities in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
we expect the sale of our investment in sen to generate taxable income which we will off set with existing net operating loss carry forwards 
we have outstanding standby letters of credit  bank guarantees and surety bonds in the amount of million to support certain operating lease obligations  workers compensation insurance  and certain value added tax claims in europe  of which million at december  was supported by cash pledged as collateral 
the pledged cash is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
on april   we entered into a revolving credit facility with a bank that provides for borrowings up to the lesser of million or specified percentages of the amounts of qualifying accounts receivable and inventory 
we are currently unable to borrow against the facility because are not currently  and do not expect to become  in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the underlying credit agreement 
this facility expires in april if we terminate this revolving credit facility prior to april   we will have to pay an early termination fee of approximately million as the date of termination 
if we terminate this revolving credit facility after april  but prior to its expiration  we will have to pay an early termination fee of approximately million as of the date of termination 
we do not currently have access to any other source of credit 
we are continuing to explore new financing sources 
however  in light of the current negative economic environment  including the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor and semicap equipment industries  and the negative effect it has had on the company s results of operations  financial position  liquidity  and the lending environment  we anticipate that it would be very difficult for us to obtain significant new credit on favorable terms  if at all 
although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of a number of factors  we believe  as discussed above  that our existing cash and cash equivalents  which include the net proceeds from the sale of our investment in sen  as well as cash generated by anticipated operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements at least through however  if that is not the case  and we are unable to obtain additional financing if and when needed  we would be required to curtail or shut down our operations  which would materially adversely affect the prospects of our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity axcelis exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists entirely of cash equivalents at december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable high investment grade securities and limiting exposure to any one issue or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our investment portfolio and  due to the nature of our investments  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our sales are billed in us dollars  thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our results 
operating margins of certain foreign operations can fluctuate with changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent revenues are billed in us dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local functional currency 
during the years ended december  and  approximately and of our revenues were derived from foreign operations with this inherent risk 
in addition  at both december  and  our operations outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of our total assets  respectively  the majority of which was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our investment in sen and our royalty and equity income from sen were subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
for royalties to be received in cash and certain other accounts receivable from sen million at december  we hedge  from time to time  our exposure to currency fluctuation through the use of forward contracts 
the effect of a depreciation of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar would result in a write down in our investment in sen and a corresponding decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity of million at december
