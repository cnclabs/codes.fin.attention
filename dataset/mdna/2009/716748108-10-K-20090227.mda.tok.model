item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview petroquest energy  inc is an independent oil and gas company  which from the commencement of operations in through  was focused exclusively in the gulf coast basin with onshore properties principally in southern louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico shelf 
during  we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties 
as part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and lower our geographic and geologic risk profile  we refocused our opportunity selection processes to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects  shift capital to higher probability of success onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program across multiple basins 
utilizing the cash flow generated by our higher margin gulf coast basin assets  we have accelerated our penetration into longer life basins in oklahoma  arkansas and texas through significantly increased and successful drilling activity and selective acquisitions 
specific asset diversification activities include the acquisition of proved reserves and acreage in the southeast carthage field in east texas 
in  we entered the arkoma basin in oklahoma by building an acreage position  drilling wells and acquiring proved reserves 
during and  we acquired additional acreage in oklahoma and texas  initiated an expanded drilling program in these areas  opened an exploration office in tulsa  oklahoma and divested several mature  high cost gulf of mexico fields 
during  we acquired a leasehold position in arkansas and continued to robustly drill in oklahoma and texas 
during  we significantly increased our acreage position in oklahoma and increased the pace of drilling operations in our longer life basins as we invested million in oklahoma  arkansas and texas 
through these efforts  at december   of our estimated proved reserves were located in longer life basins as compared to at december  and at december  during  of our production was derived from longer life basins versus and during and  respectively 
for the fifth consecutive year  we achieved annual company records for production and estimated proved reserves 
during we increased these metrics by and  respectively  from the levels achieved during our results over the last five years reflect our consistent drilling success and correlate directly with the implementation of our asset diversification strategy during comparing results with those in  we have grown production by and proved reserves by 

table of contents our capital budget is expected to range between million and million 
we plan to fund these drilling expenditures with cash flow from operations 
in response to the impact that the decline in commodity prices has on our cash flow  and the deteriorated condition of the financial markets caused by the global financial crisis  our expected capital expenditures are significantly reduced as compared to because we operate the majority of our proved reserves  we expect to be able to control the timing of a substantial portion of our capital investments 
as a result of this flexibility  we plan to actively manage our capital budget to stay within our projected cash flow from operations  with a goal of strengthening our balance sheet  based upon our expectations of commodity prices  production rates and capital costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities  unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non producing reserves 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges in place  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
oil and natural gas prices declined significantly during the third and fourth quarters of at december   we computed the estimated future net cash flows from our proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at  using average year end prices  including hedges  of per mcfe and per barrel 
due to the low market prices at september  and december   our capitalized costs exceeded the full cost ceiling  resulting in million of non cash ceiling test write downs of our oil and gas properties during given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices continue to decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that additional write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 

table of contents future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the timing of estimated costs  the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates and the political and regulatory environment 
reserve estimates our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute quantities that we are reasonably certain of recovering in future years 
at the end of each year  our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
these estimates  however  represent projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to a level where these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variance may be material 
derivative instruments the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
at inception  all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the hedged production does not occur  or the hedge otherwise does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income or expense 
our hedges are specifically referenced to nymex prices 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts  and periodically over the life of the contracts  by analyzing the correlation between nymex prices and the posted prices we receive from our designated production 
through this analysis  we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the nymex prices at which the hedges will be settled 
at december   our derivative instruments were considered effective cash flow hedges 
estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires valuation calculations incorporating estimates of future nymex prices  discount rates and price movements 
as a result  we calculate the fair value of our commodity derivatives using an independent third party s valuation model that utilizes market corroborated inputs that are observable over the term of the derivative contract 
our fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the counterparties default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of our default risk for derivative liabilities

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income loss available to common stockholders totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in net income during was primarily attributable to the following production 
during september  the majority of our gulf coast basin properties were impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike and we estimate that approximately bcfe  which would have been produced during the third and fourth quarters of  was shut in and deferred as a result of the storms 
oil production during the year ended december decreased from primarily due to normal production declines at our ship shoal and turtle bayou fields  which provide approximately one half of our total oil production 
hurricane shut in time also contributed to the decline in oil production 
currently  nearly all of our gulf coast basin production has been restored 

table of contents during late  we began drilling operations on our arkansas acreage 
as a result of production from this new basin and our continued drilling success in longer life basins  where the production is primarily natural gas  our gas production during increased from the year ended december  the increase in gas production during was partially offset by the downtime we experienced as a result of the hurricanes 
overall  production during was higher than in we have achieved company records for production in each of the last five years 
as a result of low commodity prices and our intention to completely fund our drilling activities with cash flow from operations  our capital expenditures budget will be significantly less than our spending in as a result  we expect that total production in will generally approximate production levels

revenue 
oil and gas sales during the year ended december  totaled  a increase from oil and gas sales of  during the increased revenue during was primarily the result of higher average pricing and increased gas production 
based on our outlook for oil and gas prices  we expect oil and gas sales to decline during  as compared to during  we sold the majority of our gas gathering assets located in oklahoma for net proceeds of  and recorded a  gain 
proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of our bank borrowings 
expenses 
lease operating expenses during increased to  as compared to  during on a unit of production basis  operating expenses totaled per mcfe and per mcfe during and  respectively 
the increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to the overall increase in the cost of materials  transportation  fuel and other services during as compared to for  we believe the costs of services and materials in the markets in which we operate will decline as the demand for such materials and services weakens as a result of the substantial decline in commodity prices and the overall condition of the oil and gas industry and the global economy 
production taxes totaled  and  during and  respectively 
the increase in production taxes is primarily due to higher average prices and increased production from our oklahoma  arkansas and texas properties

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our acquisition  exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  private and public offerings of equity and debt securities and sales of assets 
at december   we had a working capital surplus of million compared to a deficit of million at december  the increase in our working capital at december  was primarily attributable to the increase of our hedging asset  which is a function of lower estimated future commodity prices and the increase in our prepaid drilling costs and drilling pipe inventory  which reflects the increase in drilling activity during additionally  our accounts payable to vendors and advances from co owners liabilities decreased at december   as compared to  as a result of the timing of payments made and operated wells completed 
partially offsetting the increases in working capital was an increase in our revenue payable liability  which is a function of higher production at december  as compared to december  prices for oil and natural gas are subject to many factors beyond our control such as weather  the overall condition of the global financial markets and economies  relatively minor changes in the outlook of supply and demand  and the actions of opec 
natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
lower prices and reduced cash flow may also make it difficult to incur debt  including under our bank credit facility  because of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the notes 
see source of capital debt below 
our ability to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as natural gas and oil prices 

table of contents source of capital operations net cash flow from operations decreased from  in to  during the decrease in operating cash flow during was primarily attributable to the timing of payments made to reduce our accounts payable to vendors and the increase in our drilling pipe inventory and prepaid drilling costs  which is the result of increased drilling activity in versus source of capital debt during  we issued million in principal amount of our senior notes due the notes  which have numerous covenants including restrictions on liens  incurrence of indebtedness  asset sales  dividend payments and other restricted payments 
interest is payable semi annually on may and november at december   million had been accrued in connection with the may  interest payment and we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the notes 
on october   we entered into the credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  calyon new york branch  bank of america  na  wells fargo bank  na  and whitney national bank 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility that permits borrowings based on the available borrowing base as determined in accordance with the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit 
the credit agreement matures on february   provided  however  if on or prior to such date we prepay or refinance  subject to certain conditions  the notes  the maturity date will be extended to october  as of december  we had million of borrowings outstanding under and no letters of credit issued pursuant to the credit agreement 
the borrowing base under the credit agreement is based upon the valuation as of january and july of each year of the reserves attributable to our oil and gas properties 
the initial borrowing base is fixed at million until the first borrowing base redetermination  which is scheduled to occur by march  we or the lenders may request two additional borrowing base redeterminations each year 
each time the borrowing base is to be redetermined  the administrative agent under the credit agreement will propose a new borrowing base as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion  which must be approved by all lenders if the borrowing base is to be increased  or by lenders holding two thirds of the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement if the borrowing base remains the same or is reduced 
at december   our borrowing base exceeded our outstanding borrowings by million  however  as a result of the declines in commodity prices since the establishment of the borrowing base  we anticipate that our next regularly scheduled borrowing base redetermination  which is scheduled to occur by march   will result in a borrowing base of less than million 
as a result of the redetermination  we may be unable to borrow any additional funds under the credit agreement  and if the revised borrowing base is less than million  we will be obligated to repay the amount by which our aggregate credit exposure under the credit agreement exceeds the revised borrowing base within forty five days after the revised borrowing base is determined 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million that we believe would be sufficient to repay amounts that may be required as a result of the redetermined borrowing base 
the indenture governing the notes also limits our ability to incur indebtedness under the credit agreement 
under the indenture we will not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the credit agreement in excess of of our adjusted consolidated net tangible assets as defined in the indenture 
that calculation is based primarily on the valuation of our estimated reserves of oil and natural gas using year end commodity prices 
until recalculated  we will not be able to incur new indebtedness under the credit agreement in excess of approximately million 
while the indenture limits the amount of new indebtedness that may be incurred under the credit agreement  it does not restrict the amount of that indebtedness that may be outstanding under the credit agreement 
therefore  even though the amount of indebtedness under the credit agreement at december  exceeds of the adjusted consolidated net tangible assets  we are not required by the indenture to reduce the amount currently outstanding 
the credit agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and subsidiaries  including a lien on all equipment and at least of the aggregate total value of the company s oil and gas properties 
outstanding balances under the credit agreement bear interest at the alternate base rate abr plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage or the adjusted libo rate eurodollar plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
however  for the first six months of the credit agreement  the margin will be for abr loans and for eurodollar loans 
outstanding letters of credit will be charged a participation fee at a per annum rate equal to the margin applicable to eurodollar loans  a fronting fee and customary administrative fees 

table of contents we are subject to certain restrictive financial covenants under the credit agreement  including a maximum ratio of total debt to ebitdax  determined on a rolling four quarter basis  of to  and a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of to  as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes customary restrictions with respect to debt  liens  dividends  distributions and redemptions  investments  loans and advances  nature of business  international operations and foreign subsidiaries  leases  sale or discount of receivables  mergers or consolidations  sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  negative pledge agreements  gas imbalances and swap agreements

source of capital issuance of securities during  we issued a total of  shares of series b preferred stock resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
cash dividends are payable quarterly in the amount of per share of series b preferred stock 
based on the total of  shares of series b preferred stock issued  the annual dividend payment  if declared and paid  is approximately million 
after giving effect to the issuance of the series b preferred stock  we have approximately million remaining under an effective universal shelf registration statement relating to the potential public offer and sale of any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  and warrants 
the registration statement does not provide any assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
source of capital divestitures we do not budget for property divestitures  however  we are continually evaluating our property base to determine if there are assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our strategic objectives 
from time to time we may divest certain non strategic assets in order to provide capital to be reinvested in higher rate of return projects or in projects that have longer estimated lives 
during  we sold the majority of our gas gathering systems located in oklahoma for net proceeds of million and recorded a million gain 
the net proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any of our assets in the future 
use of capital exploration and development our capital budget  which includes capitalized interest and general and administrative costs  is expected to range between million and million 
we plan to continue our strategic focus of funding our drilling expenditures with cash flow from operations 
in response to the recent decline in commodity prices and the deteriorated condition of the capital markets caused by the global financial crisis  we have reduced our capital expenditure budget for  as compared to because we operate the majority of our proved reserves  we expect to be able to control the timing of a substantial portion of our capital investments 
as a result of this flexibility  we plan to actively manage our capital budget to stay within our projected cash flow from operations  with a goal of strengthening our balance sheet  based upon our expectations of commodity prices  production rates and capital costs 
however  if commodity prices continue to decline or if actual production or costs vary significantly from our expectations  our exploration and development activities could be reduced further or could require additional financings  which may include sales of equity or debt securities  sales of properties or assets or joint venture arrangements with industry partners 
as a result of the current condition of the financial markets  we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we could be forced to further delay  reduce our participation in or even abandon some of our exploration and development opportunities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
because all of our properties are located within the united states  we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we expect to receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production through commodity derivative instruments 
in the settlement of a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparties to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparties this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
during  we paid approximately million to the counterparties to our derivative instruments in connection with net hedge settlements 
we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
our credit agreement requires that the counterparties to our hedge contracts be lenders under the credit agreement or  if not a lender under the credit agreement  rated a a or higher by s p or moody s 
currently  the counterparties to our existing hedge contracts are jp morgan and calyon  both of which are lenders under the credit agreement 
to the extent we enter into additional hedge contracts  we would expect that certain of the lenders under the credit agreement would serve as counterparties
