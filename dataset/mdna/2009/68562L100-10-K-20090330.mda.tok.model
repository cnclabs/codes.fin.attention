item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the accuracy of which involves risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us described in risk factors 
overview background and basis of presentation on november   the orchard enterprises  inc formerly known as digital music group  inc or dmgi consummated a business combination with orchard enterprises ny  inc formerly known as the orchard enterprises inc  which we refer to as orchard ny through a merger of a subsidiary of dmgi with and into orchard ny pursuant to the terms of the second amended and restated merger agreement dated october   as amended on november  the merger 
pursuant to the terms of the merger  all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of orchard ny was cancelled and the former stockholders of orchard ny received an aggregate of  shares of our common stock after giving effect to a one for three reverse stock split of our common stock that took effect on november  and  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock the series a preferred stock 
in addition  dmgi assumed the obligations of orchard ny under its outstanding deferred common and preferred stock awards and reserved  shares of our common stock on a post split basis and  shares of series a preferred stock for issuance pursuant to such awards 
in connection with the merger  orchard ny became our wholly owned subsidiary  with the former stockholders of orchard ny collectively owning shares of our common and preferred stock representing approximately of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock 
the orchard enterprises  inc and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as we  us  and the company 
see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report for further details on the merger 
for accounting purposes  the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition with orchard ny being the accounting acquirer 
accordingly  the historical financial results prior to the merger are those of orchard ny and its consolidated subsidiaries and replace the historical financial results of dmgi as it existed prior to the merger 
the results of operations for dmgi and its pre merger consolidated subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial results beginning on november  the presentation of consolidated statements of stockholders equity deficit and redeemable preferred stock reflects the historical stockholders equity of orchard ny through november  the effect of the issuance of shares of dmgi common stock and dmgi series a preferred stock in connection with the merger and the inclusion of dmgi s outstanding shares of common stock at the time of the merger on november  is reflected in the year ended december  orchard ny was incorporated in new york in september on april   dimensional associates  llc  or dimensional  an entity formed by a group of private investors  invested in and acquired operating control of orchard ny through the purchase of a convertible debt instrument followed by subsequent periodic funding events under similar conditions as the original convertible debt instrument 
these debt instruments were redeemed or converted prior to completion of the merger and are described below in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
on june   the united states bankruptcy court of the southern district of new york the bankruptcy court entered an order that  among other things  approved the sale of substantially all of the assets of 
table of contents teevee toons  inc debtor in possession tvt to the company pursuant to the terms and conditions of the form of asset purchase agreement provided to the bankruptcy court 
on july  the company and tvt entered into a definitive purchase agreement the asset purchase agreement pursuant to which the company i acquired substantially all of the assets of tvt s record label business operations including  but not limited to  master recordings  artists agreements  certain inventory  accounts receivable and a real property lease and ii assumed certain liabilities of tvt related to the assets that the company elected to acquire 
for accounting purposes  the asset purchase was treated as a business combination 
the results of operations from the tvt acquisition are included in our consolidated financial results beginning july  we are a global leader in digital media services  controlling and distributing more than  music and other audio recordings  or tracks  and approximately  titles of video programming and other materials through hundreds of digital stores eg  amazon  emusic which is controlled by our majority stockholder  dimensional  hulu  itunes  rhapsody  youtube and mobile carriers eg  china mobile  orange  telefonica  verizon  worldwide 
we generate income for our label  retailer  brand and agency clients by making these music and audio recordings and videos available for purchase at online stores and through innovative marketing and promotional campaigns  branded entertainment programs  film  advertising  gaming and television licensing and other related services 
significant customers since inception through december   our revenue has been derived primarily from the distribution of digital music content 
two customers  itunes and emusic  account for a significant portion of our total revenue and related accounts receivable 
for the years ended december  and  itunes represented and of total revenue and emusic represented and of total revenue  respectively 
accounts receivable from itunes were and of total accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
accounts receivable from emusic were and of total accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
sources of revenues our revenues are derived from the following sources permanent downloads 
in aggregate terms  our permanent download revenue is driven by the number of music recordings we have available for downloading at digital music retailers  multiplied by the average number of times our music recordings are downloaded  multiplied by the average fee paid to us by each retailer 
the download rates for our music recordings are driven primarily by the overall size and growth of the digital music market  the popularity and demand for the recordings we make available  the number and nature of the digital music services through which we make the recordings available to consumers  and our territorial distribution rights 
we negotiate the fee we receive per download in advance at the time we enter into an agreement with a digital music retailer 
subscription download services on the internet 
we also generate revenues from services that offer consumers the ability to download up to a certain number of recordings each month for a fixed subscription fee 
in such models  we typically receive a percentage of the total revenue pool generated by the service  after contractually specified costs and deductions  based on our share of total downloads in the service during the billing period 
subscription streaming fees 
some digital music retailers distribute our music recordings via streaming on a subscription basis 
our subscription revenue is a percentage of each retailer s total subscription revenue after contractually specified costs and deductions based on the number of times our music recordings are listened to by subscribers as compared to the total for all music recordings listened to during the relevant time period  although the exact formulations by which our revenue is derived varies among services 
following the termination of their subscription  consumers are not able to play our music recordings 
mobile services 
our revenue from mobile services is derived primarily from downloads of full length music recordings and mastertones 
most mobile services generally make available to 
table of contents consumers a limited selection of ringtones due to the limited space on mobile handset screens and higher per track processing costs related to the many formats that are required for various mobile handset makes and models  although this is changing 
other 
our other revenue is comprised mainly from licensing fees also referred to as music services  administrative and consulting fees and other sources such as technology related servicing fees charged to certain digital music retailers and other non retail clients 
combined revenue from digital downloads and subscription fees comprised approximately of our total revenue for each of the years ended december  and approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  was derived from mobile services 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of revenue sharing payments and recoupment of cash advances to artists  record labels and other content owners  royalties to artists and publishers  amortization of costs to acquire master recordings  digital rights and digital distribution agreements  reserves or write downs of master recordings  capitalized digital rights  digital distribution agreements or royalty advances that may be deemed necessary from time to time  and other direct costs of revenues 
our cost of revenues and corresponding gross profit is determined by the revenues earned on our available music  audio and video content 
in our digital distribution agreements with content owners  which usually have terms of three to five years  we typically have an exclusive right to collect revenue directly from the digital entertainment services 
we then pay a negotiated revenue sharing percentage to the content owner 
in certain instances  with respect to higher profile labels and or as an inducement to enter into a longer term license agreement  we may make a royalty advance against the content owner s share of future royalties 
we capitalize all such advances as a prepaid asset that we amortize as a cost of revenue as the related revenue is earned and the cash advances are recouped 
we also include in cost of revenues the fees and direct costs incurred in obtaining content 
for long term distribution agreements  we amortize the legal fees and other direct costs incurred in acquiring the agreement on a straight line basis over the shorter of the term of the related agreement or ten years 
when we acquire digital rights or master recordings  we capitalize the purchase price and the direct ancillary costs and amortize the acquisition costs on a straight line basis over ten years 
while we are typically not responsible for any third party royalties such as artists and publishers in our agreements with content owners  for music content that we own and for content distributed under most of our long term distribution agreements  we are typically responsible for some or all third party royalties such as artists and publishers  the cost of which is included in cost of revenues 
artist royalty obligations for music and audio recordings have historically been between and of the revenue attributable to a specific track or album 
the publisher royalties for music and audio recordings are a statutory rate in the united states  which was 
for and in connection with the allocation of the purchase price to the assets we were deemed to have acquired from dmgi for accounting purposes  we established an asset called digital distribution agreements  which is a component of music and audio content  to reflect the estimated fair market value of dmgi s license agreements at the merger date 
we are amortizing this asset to cost of revenues over the term of the related agreements 

table of contents we include in cost of revenues depreciation and amortization associated with equipment and computer software that we use to digitally encode music files 
historically  when we have utilized third parties to digitally encode music files into the specific formats required by digital entertainment services  we also included these costs in cost of revenues 
we also charge any other third party costs directly associated with earning other revenue to cost of revenues 
operating expenses include all costs associated with general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing and product development in order to operate the business 
seasonality we have experienced increased net sales in our first and fourth quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year 
we suspect that the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year may have seasonally higher sales  because this is the peak time for sales of music recordings in physical format  portable digital music players and other digital music listening and video devices including mobile phones generally ascribed to increased consumer spending due to the holidays 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require significant judgments and estimates 
for additional information relating to these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
in general  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  the product or services have been delivered and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our distribution revenue from the sale of music recordings through digital distribution channels is recognized when the products are sold by the digital service providers  which provide us with periodic notification of the sales 
for arrangements with multiple obligations eg  deliverable and undelivered music content  music publishing information and other services  we allocate revenues to each component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value 
we recognize revenues allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for product revenues set forth above are met 
if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered obligations is not available  the arrangement consideration allocable to a delivered item is combined with the amount allocable to the undelivered item s within the arrangement 
revenues are recognized as the remaining obligations are fulfilled 
revenues from multiple element arrangements were not significant during and in accordance with industry practice and as is customary in many territories  certain physical products such as cds and cassettes are sold to customers with the right to return unsold items 
we recognize net distribution revenues from such physical sales when reported to us by the retail distributor for the products that are shipped based on gross sales typically less a provision for future estimated returns determined by distributor based on historical trends 
during and  revenues from physical sales were not significant 

table of contents we recognize reimbursements received from our customers for encoding our music content in the appropriate digital format for use by the customer under the proportional performance method as revenue in the period that the encoded content is delivered to the customer 
we record cash received in advance of providing the service as deferred revenue 
we record the costs associated with shipping physical products as cost of revenues 
shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in revenues 
the physical products are the property of the recording labels and artists 
revenues and cost from shipping and handling were not significant in or because we receive payment at approximately the same time as we receive the detailed revenue reports  our accounts receivable therefore generally consists of approximately one month s revenue for digital entertainment services that report on a monthly basis and one quarter s revenue for digital entertainment services that report on a quarterly basis 
in making estimates regarding the collectability of our accounts receivable  our management considers the credit profile of our retailers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  historic payment experience and known or expected events that may impact the retailer s ability to pay its obligations 
historically  we have incurred minimal losses for bad debts  although in the fourth quarter of we incurred a loss for bad debt of approximately  and may incur additional losses in the future 
we maintained a bad debt allowance of  at december  and  at december  recoverability of royalty advances we pay advance royalties to certain record labels and artists and account for these advance royalty payments pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 financial reporting in the record and music industry sfas 
pursuant to sfas  certain advance royalty payments that are believed to be recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the content owner or its distributor are capitalized as assets 
the decision to capitalize an advance to a content owner or its distributor as an asset requires significant judgment as to the recoverability of these advances 
we assess the recoverability of these assets upon initial commitment of the advance based upon our forecast of anticipated revenues from the sale of future and existing music and publishing related products 
in determining whether these amounts are recoverable  we evaluate the current and past popularity of the artist or songwriter  the initial or expected commercial acceptability of the product  the current and past popularity of the genre of music that the product is designed to appeal to  and other relevant factors 
based upon this information  the portion of such advances that is believed not to be recoverable is expensed 
all advances are assessed for recoverability periodically and  at minimum  on a quarterly basis 
accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes result primarily from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance when management is unable to conclude that our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized from the results of operations 
at each of the financial statement dates presented  we recorded a full valuation allowance against deferred income taxes due to our limited operating history and net losses recorded since inception 
our estimate for the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about projected future operating results 
if actual results differ from these projections or if management s expectations of future results change  it may be necessary to adjust the valuation allowance 
we have generated losses for federal and state income tax reporting since inception 
these tax losses are available for carryforward until their expiration 
in addition to potential expiration  there are other factors that could limit our ability to use our federal and state tax loss carryforwards 
for example  use of prior net operating loss carryforwards can be limited after an ownership change  such as the merger 
accordingly  it is not certain how much of our existing net operating loss carryforwards will be available for use 
in addition  we must generate taxable income in the future in order to use net operating loss carryforwards that have not expired 

table of contents effective january   we began to measure and record uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of this interpretation 
fin also provides guidance on accounting for derecognition  interest and penalties  and classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes 
accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions under fin involves significant judgments by management 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including license rights  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
in connection with this review  we reevaluate the periods of depreciation and amortization 
we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be realized from the asset is less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  which is determined using the projected discounted future net cash flows 
we measure fair value by discounting estimated future net cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
our most significant estimates and judgments relating to the long lived asset impairments include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in future cash flows 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense under the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based compensation 
as a result  we recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of share based awards and issuances  such as stock options and warrants granted to employees and non employees 
this estimation of the fair value of each share based grant or issuance on the date of grant involves numerous assumptions by management 
although we calculate the compensatory element under the trinomial lattice model  which is a standard option pricing model  this model still requires the use of numerous assumptions 
assumptions used in this model include  among others  the expected life turnover  a risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and assumptions as to volatility of the underlying equity security 
the model and assumptions also attempt to account for changing employee behavior as the stock price changes and capture the observed pattern of increasing rates of exercise as the stock price increases 
we based our assumption of the expected volatility of our stock on the historical volatility for our peer group public companies because sufficient historical trading data does not yet exist for our stock 
the use of different peer group companies and other assumptions by management in the trinomial lattice model could produce substantially different results 
goodwill our goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets of dmgi and tvt records as a result of the merger and acquisition of tvt s assets 
we will review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the provisions of sfas require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we will compare the fair value to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill will not be considered impaired and we will not be required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the implied fair value involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected 
table of contents future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
impairment of intangible assets we test our intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment annually  and more frequently if there are indications of a loss in value 
the most significant intangible assets that we test for impairment are those resulting from the merger 
we test for impairment on the basis of the same objective criteria that were used for the initial valuation 
our initial valuation and ongoing tests are based on the relationship of the value of our projected future cash flows associated with the asset to either the purchase price of the asset for its initial valuation or the carrying amount of the asset for ongoing tests 
the determination of the underlying assumptions related to the recoverability of intangible assets is subjective and requires the exercise of considerable judgment by our management 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge

internal control over financial reporting in connection with the audit for the year ended december   our independent auditors identified significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting regarding our lack of formalized written policies and procedures in the financial accounting area  our lack of appropriate resources to both manage the financial close process on a timely basis and handle the accounting for complex equity and other transactions  our lack of sophisticated financial reporting systems to allow the reporting of financial information on a timely basis  which is due in part to the small size of our company prior to the merger  and our lack of a formalized disaster recovery plan in the information technology area 
these significant deficiencies together constitute a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting 
during  management implemented various remedial actions to address the above mentioned significant deficiencies 
management believes that 
table of contents these significant deficiencies have been effectively remediated in conjunction with the company s sarbanes implementation project 
see item a t for additional discussion of remedial action implemented by management during factors affecting future results we have incurred losses since inception and our ability to achieve profitability in the near term is primarily dependent on increasing revenue while controlling and limiting expenses at current levels 
some of the current industry conditions and factors that we expect could have a significant impact on our future results are discussed below factors impacting revenue and download rates for music content 
achieving profitable growth will require continued growth in the overall market for digital retail sales of music  video and other forms of media and our ability to maintain a competitive suite of digital distribution and service offerings that will be attractive to independent record labels and other owners of digital media content 
we expect continued competition from entrenched music distribution companies moving more aggressively into the digital sector eg  the distribution companies owned by the four major music companies  other independent distributors and new entrants to the market 
we believe that our revenue and download rates for music content might be affected by a number of macro factors  including the general economic recession  overall growth of the legitimate retail consumer market for digital music  in the context of a still robust so called peer to peer pp pirate market  amount of additional digital music and video recordings that are made available to consumers from all sources and the impact on average sales that results from having an increasing amount of music and video content available within the retail channels  the pressure variable pricing or other structural change to other download pricing models will have on the expectations of the consumer for the cost of downloading tracks  the speed and efficacy with which new digital entertainment services either through traditional a la carte downloads or subscription models or new forms of music retail such as advertising based or pp models enter and grow the market  and the speed and efficacy with which digital music retailers invest on one hand in product enhancements that allow them to more dynamically serve music to targeted subgroups eg  ethnic nationals living abroad and  on the other hand  particularly with respect to mobile operators  integrate their sophisticated marketing segmentation and direct marketing capabilities more closely with demographically based music marketing 
gross profit 
our gross profit is directly affected by our ability to negotiate favorable digital distribution agreements with record labels and other content owners 
the current and future marketplace will continue to evolve and shape our ability to enter into new distribution agreements with content owners seeking to access the digital marketplace and renew existing agreements as they begin to expire 
as more competitors enter this market and seek to sign similar agreements with content owners  this could adversely impact our gross profit 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses include all costs associated with general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing and product development in order to operate the business 
these expenses increased in each of the past three years as we added additional personnel dedicated to expanding our operations and broadening our product and service offerings and due to costs associated with being a public company  such as professional and filing fees 
business development 
we plan to continue to build our core music and video businesses by building on our established digital distribution relationships and by adding additional record labels and content owners  showcasing top tier global artists  expanding our marketing capabilities and offering physical distribution to select labels 
we also plan to continue to develop our broad services platform  including marketing and technology programs to service brands  consumer packaged goods companies and other businesses integrating music with their marketing objectives  
table of contents placement of master recordings for synchronization use in advertising  film and television programs  mechanical licensing and administration of music publishing for digital sales in the united states  and collection of sound performance recording royalties globally  among other offerings

the increase in paid downloads resulted primarily from a significant increase in the average number of available tracks for sale  which increase resulted from organic growth and the effects of the merger 
the increase in paid downloads is also in part due to a more efficient distribution process  which resulted in part from launch of our proprietary vector tm system in digital distribution revenue in includes approximately million from tvt
