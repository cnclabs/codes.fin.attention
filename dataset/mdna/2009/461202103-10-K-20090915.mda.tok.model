you should note that this md a discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see the section entitled forward looking statements and risk factors at the beginning of item a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 
you should read this md a in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item in february we completed the acquisition of digital insight corporation for a total purchase price of approximately billion 
in december we acquired homestead technologies inc for total consideration of approximately million and in february we acquired electronic clearing house  inc echo for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in july we acquired paycycle  inc for a total purchase price of approximately million 
accordingly  we have included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 
during fiscal and fiscal we transitioned certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to automatic data processing  inc adp 
we have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our intuit distribution management solutions business as discontinued operations 
see results of operations dispositions and discontinued operations later in this item for more information 
unless otherwise noted  the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 
in fiscal we reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the continued evolution of our business 
we no longer combine results for our payroll business with results for our payments business because management currently views these businesses separately 
we also changed the name of our quickbooks segment to financial management solutions  our new payroll segment to employee management solutions  and our new payments segment to payments solutions 
we transferred revenue for our point of sale offerings from our financial management solutions segment to our payments solutions segment to align this product group more closely with the customers they serve 
total point of sale revenue was less than million for all periods presented 
we also reclassified certain retail sales expenses from common expenses to segment income or loss  consistent with how management now views these expenses 
these expenses were less than million for all periods presented 
executive overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business 
we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview of financial results total net revenue for fiscal was billion  an increase of compared with fiscal the fiscal revenue increase was due to revenue growth in our consumer tax  payments solutions  employee management solutions  accounting professionals and financial institutions segments  partially offset by revenue decreases in our other businesses and financial management solutions segments 
consumer tax revenue increased million or due to growth in turbotax online units  which more than offset a decrease in turbotax desktop units 

table of contents operating income from continuing operations of million for fiscal increased million or compared with fiscal fiscal revenue grew million and total costs and expenses increased million 
total costs and expenses for fiscal increased due to our fiscal acquisitions of homestead and echo  higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of turbotax and quickbooks  higher depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure  higher share based compensation expense  and a charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights 
decreases in total costs and expenses due to lower performance incentive payouts as well as other compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing and lower severance charges partially offset these increases 
net income from continuing operations of million for fiscal decreased million or compared with fiscal in fiscal we recorded a pre tax gain of million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets  there was no comparable transaction in fiscal in addition  interest income decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal due to the impact of lower interest rates that more than offset the impact of higher invested balances 
due to the foregoing factors  diluted net income per share from continuing operations of in fiscal increased compared with in fiscal in july we acquired paycycle  inc for a total purchase price of approximately million 
paycycle is a provider of online payroll services to small businesses and became part of our employee management solutions segment 
we ended fiscal with cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling billion  an increase of million from july  cash  cash equivalents and investments at july  included in municipal auction rate securities 
we did not classify any of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july  as cash  cash equivalents and investments 
at july  and  we also held million and million in municipal auction rate securities that we classified as long term investments on our balance sheet 
see liquidity and capital resources auction rate securities  later in this item for more information 
in fiscal we generated million in cash from continuing operations and million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
during the same period we used million in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs  million for capital expenditures  and million for acquisitions of businesses primarily paycycle and intangible assets 
at july   we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional million for stock repurchases through may  on september  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mint software inc  a provider of online personal finance management services 
the cash transaction is valued at approximately million  including the assumption of mint outstanding stock options 
mint will become part of our other businesses segment 
the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions 
we expect the transaction to close before the end of calendar seasonality our quickbooks  consumer tax and accounting professionals offerings are highly seasonal 
some of our other offerings are also seasonal  but to a lesser extent 
revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters 
sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april 
in our consumer tax business  a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online  for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return 
the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions 
delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter 
these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january and third quarter ending april we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october and fourth quarter ending july  when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 
in addition  the timing and composition of new 
table of contents customer offerings that include both product and service elements can materially shift revenue between quarters 
we believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form k with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products  license fees  software subscriptions  product support  hosting services  payroll services  merchant services  professional services  transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
for additional information  see revenue recognition in note to the financial statements in item we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
in connection with the sale of certain products  we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers 
we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant 
the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent 
we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 
return and rebate reserves as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates 
our return policy allows distributors and retailers  subject to contractual limitations  to return purchased products 
product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products 
in determining our product returns reserves  we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  historical return rates for prior releases of the product  trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products 
we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 
our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates 
our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs  which we typically establish annually 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program  actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if we were to change our 
table of contents assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our future reported revenue 
for example  if we had increased our fiscal returns reserves by of non consignment sales to retailers for quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  our total net revenue for fiscal would have been about million lower 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 
fair value of investments we estimate the fair value of our available for sale securities each quarter 
these investments consist of cash equivalents  municipal bonds  us agency securities  corporate notes and municipal auction rate securities 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets  the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low 
this is generally true for our cash equivalents  municipal bonds  us agency securities and corporate notes 
however  significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not available 
for example  we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive 
we based this determination on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets  regularly scheduled auctions for the municipal auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since february some of the key inputs to our discounted cash flow model are inherently uncertain 
the key inputs include projected future interest rates  the likely timing of principal repayments  the probability of full repayment  publicly available pricing data for recently issued similar securities that are not subject to auctions  and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities 
at july   we held a total of million in municipal auction rate securities 
we record unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale securities in other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that the decrease in fair value is other than temporary 
we consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the reason for the decrease in fair value  the severity of the decrease in fair value  the length of time that the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis 
changes in our estimates of the fair values of our available for sale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs 
business combinations purchase accounting under the purchase method of accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing purchased technology  customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying 
table of contents business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach 
the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions  including market factors specific to the business  the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time  long term growth rates for the business  and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 
we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions 
although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
when using the market approach  we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses 
we base our judgments on factors such as size  growth rates  profitability  risk  and return on investment 
we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue  operating income  and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses 
we had a total of billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july  see note to the financial statements in item for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 
in order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives  we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets 
the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 
significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite lives 
we had a total of million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet at july  assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
for example  if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units  we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
accounting for share based compensation plans at july   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of years 

table of contents we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in note to the financial statements in item to estimate the fair value of stock options granted 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we amortize the fair value of options on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
we value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method 
we amortize the value of restricted stock units on a straight line basis over the restriction period 
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance when we prepare our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 
at july   we had net deferred tax assets of million which included a valuation allowance of million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely 
table of contents of being realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
our evaluations are based upon a number of factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change  which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 
results of operations financial overview fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions  except per share amounts change change total net revenue operating income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations diluted net income per share from continuing operations total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal consumer tax segment revenue increased million or in fiscal due to growth in turbotax online units  which more than offset an decrease in turbotax desktop units 
payments solutions segment revenue increased million or in fiscal due to growth in the core merchant services customer base and revenue from echo  partially offset by a decline in transaction processing volume per customer

revenue in our other businesses segment decreased million or in fiscal and revenue in our financial management solutions segment decreased million or 
we believe that fiscal revenue in these two segments was affected by slower small business and consumer spending 
see total net revenue by business segment later in this item for more information 
operating income from continuing operations for fiscal increased million or compared with fiscal the increase in operating income was due to million in higher revenue partially offset by million in higher costs and expenses 
in fiscal total costs and expenses increased about million due to our fiscal acquisitions of homestead and echo  about million due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of turbotax and quickbooks  about million due to higher depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure  about million due to higher share based compensation expense  and million due to a charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights 
these increases in total costs and expenses were partially offset by decreases of about million due to lower performance incentive payouts and about million in compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing levels and lower severance related charges in fiscal see cost of revenue and operating expenses later in this item for more information 
net income from continuing operations decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal in fiscal we recorded a pre tax gain of million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets  there was no comparable transaction in fiscal see dispositions and discontinued operations later in this item for more information 
in addition  interest and other income decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the impact of lower interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average invested balances and resulted in million lower interest income

we have reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the continued evolution of our business 
we no longer combine results for our payroll operating segment with results for our payments operating segment because management currently views these businesses separately 
we also changed the name of our quickbooks segment to financial management solutions  our new payroll segment to employee management solutions  and our new payments segment to payments solutions 
we transferred revenue for our point of sale offerings from our financial management solutions segment to our payments solutions segment to align this product group more closely with the customers they serve 
total point of sale revenue was less than million for all periods presented 
we also reclassified certain retail sales expenses from common expenses to segment income or loss  consistent with how management now views these expenses

employee management solutions formerly known as payroll fiscal compared with fiscal employee management solutions total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal due predominantly to the realization of the full effect in fiscal of pricing changes made in fiscal paycycle  which we acquired in july  had a negligible effect on fiscal employee management solutions revenue 
fiscal compared with fiscal employee management solutions total net revenue decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal as we completed the transition of portions of our complete payroll and premier payroll services customer base in connection with a sale of assets to adp 
we estimate that revenue growth in this segment in fiscal compared with fiscal would have been approximately when adjusted for the impact of the sale of those payroll customers 
payments solutions fiscal compared with fiscal payments solutions total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal revenue in fiscal increased due to growth in our core merchant services customer base and revenue from echo  which we acquired in february transaction volume per customer was down about in fiscal compared with fiscal  reflecting an overall reduction in consumer spending associated with the current economic environment

table of contents our cost of revenue has three components cost of product revenue  which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our desktop software products  cost of service and other revenue  which reflects direct costs associated with providing services  including data center costs related to delivering internet based services  and costs associated with revenue sharing and online transactions revenue  and amortization of purchased intangible assets  which represents the cost of amortizing developed technologies that we have obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives 
fiscal compared with fiscal cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal due to product mix 
cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue decreased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal due to an increase of million in revenue from turbotax online and consumer electronic tax filing services  which have relatively lower costs of service revenue compared with our other service offerings 
partially offsetting this benefit  fiscal cost of service and other revenue included a million charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights that we acquired in may amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due primarily to the amortization of homestead and echo purchased intangible assets  which we acquired in fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to cost efficiencies achieved for our quickbooks and consumer tax product lines

at july  
table of contents and  we also held million and million in municipal auction rate securities that we classified as long term investments on our balance sheet 
see auction rate securities below for more information 
our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations  which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services 
our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs  selling and marketing activities  capital projects  acquisitions of businesses  debt service costs and repurchases of common stock 
in march we issued five year and ten year senior unsecured notes totaling billion in connection with our acquisition of digital insight 
we also have a million unsecured revolving line of credit facility that is described later in this item to date we have not borrowed under the facility 
the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated july  july  dollars in millions change change cash  cash equivalents and investments long term investments long term debt working capital ratio of current assets to current liabilities auction rate securities at july   we held a total of million in municipal auction rate securities 
based on the maturities of the underlying securities and the put option described below  we classified million of these securities as short term investments and million of these securities as long term investments on our balance sheet at that date 
all of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july  were rated a or better by the major credit rating agencies and were collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us department of education 
these securities are long term debt instruments that are intended to provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  typically every days 
due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets  in february auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held 
regularly scheduled auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time 
when these auctions initially failed  higher interest rates for many of the securities went into effect in accordance with the terms of the prospectus for each security 
as of july   we had received all interest payments in accordance with the contractual terms of these securities 
during fiscal issuers redeemed at par value million of municipal auction rate securities that we held 
in august the broker dealers for our municipal auction rate securities announced settlements under which they may provide liquidity solutions  or purchase  the auction rate securities held by their institutional clients 
on november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  one of the broker dealers for our municipal auction rate securities  that gives us the option to sell ubs a total of million in municipal auction rate securities at par value at any time during a two year period beginning june  the offer also gives ubs the discretion to buy any or all of these municipal auction rate securities from us at par value at any time 
to date ubs has not purchased any of these securities from us 
we currently intend to exercise our option to sell ubs all of these municipal auction rate securities at par value in accordance with the terms of the offer within the next twelve months 
we continue to have counter party risk associated with ubs 
based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during fiscal this period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk 
the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades 
in light of the current market conditions and these additional risks  we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest 
we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments 
while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks  such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 
our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy 
this policy specifies that  except for direct obligations of the united states government  securities issued by agencies of the united states government  and money market funds  we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments 
see note to the financial statements in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  in item  and risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for a description of market events that have affected the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at july  the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities as of july  by stated maturity 
the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents  which consist primarily of money market funds 
at july   the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 
years ending july  and in thousands thereafter total cash equivalents investments long term investments total interest rate risk our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments 
should the federal reserve target rate increase by basis points from the level of july   the value of our investments would decrease by approximately million 
should the federal reserve target rate increase by basis points from the level of july   the value of our investments would decrease by approximately million 
we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our million revolving credit facility 
advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to citibank s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from to based on our senior debt credit ratings 
consequently  our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility 
at july   no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

table of contents on march  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due on march  and million of senior unsecured notes due on march  since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates  they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
impact of foreign currency rate changes the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are the local currencies 
we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date 
we translate their revenue  costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period 
we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets 
we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 
since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars  british pounds  indian rupees and singapore dollars into u 
s dollars for financial reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results 
the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future  there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future 
as of july  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
