item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion and analysis of imperial s financial results  as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer  are the responsibility of the management of imperial oil limited 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving the extracting  refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon based products 
the company s business involves the production or purchase  manufacture and sale of physical products  and all commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical movement of goods 
imperial  with its resource base  financial strength  disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio  is well positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new canadian energy supplies 
while commodity prices remain volatile on a short term basis depending upon supply and demand  imperial s investment decisions are based on its long term business outlook  using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities 
the corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting near term operating and capital objectives  in addition to providing the longer term economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes 
potential investment opportunities are tested over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the resiliency of each opportunity 
once investments are made  a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated into future projects 
business environment and risk assessment long term business outlook economic and population growth are expected to remain the primary drivers of energy demand  globally and in north america 
the company expects the global economy to grow at an average rate of about three percent per year through the combination of population and economic growth should lead to an increase in demand for 
table of contents primary energy at an average rate of percent annually 
the vast majority of this increase is expected to occur in developing countries 
oil  gas and coal are expected to remain the predominant energy sources with approximately an percent share of total energy 
oil and gas alone are expected to maintain close to a percent share 
over the same period  the canadian economy is expected to grow at an average rate of about two percent per year  and canadian demand for energy at about half of one percent per year 
oil and gas are expected to continue to supply about two thirds of canadian energy demand 
it is expected that canada will also be a growing supplier of energy to us markets through this period 
oil products are the transportation fuel of choice for the world s fleet of cars  trucks  trains  ships and airplanes 
primarily because of increased demand in developing countries  oil consumption is expected to increase by about percent or over million barrels a day by canada s oil resources  second only to saudi arabia  represent an important potential additional source of supply 
natural gas is expected to be a major primary energy source globally  capturing about percent of all incremental energy growth and approaching one quarter of global energy supplies 
natural gas production from conventional sources in mature established regions in the united states and canada is not expected to meet increasing demand  strengthening the market opportunities for new gas supply from canada s frontier areas and unconventional resources 
upstream imperial produces crude oil and natural gas for sale into large north american markets 
crude oil and natural gas prices are determined by global and north american markets and are subject to changing supply and demand conditions 
these can be influenced by a wide range of factors  including economic conditions  international political developments and weather 
in the past  crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile  and the company expects that volatility to continue 
imperial s fundamental upstream business strategies guide our exploration  development  production and gas marketing activities 
these strategies include identifying and pursuing all attractive exploration opportunities  investing in projects that deliver superior returns and maximizing profitability of existing oil and gas production 
these strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational excellence  commitment to innovative technologies  development of our employees and investment in the communities in which we operate 
imperial has a large portfolio of oil and gas resources in canada  both developed and undeveloped  which helps reduce the risks of dependence on potentially limited supply sources in the upstream 
with the relative maturity of conventional production in the established producing areas of western canada  imperial s production is expected to come increasingly from frontier and unconventional sources  particularly heavy oil  oil sands and unconventional natural gas and from canada s north  where imperial has large undeveloped resource opportunities 
downstream the downstream industry environment remains very competitive 
refining margins are the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials primarily crude oil and the wholesale market prices for the range of products produced primarily gasoline  diesel fuel  heating oil  jet fuel and heavy fuel oil 
while volatile from year to year  refining margins have declined at a rate of about one percent per year  on average  over the past years in inflation adjusted terms 
intense competition in the retail fuels market similarly has tended to drive down real margins over time 
crude oil and many products are widely traded with published international prices 
prices for those commodities are determined by the marketplace  often an international marketplace  and are affected by many factors  including global and regional supply demand balances  inventory levels  refinery operations  import export balances  transportation logistics  seasonality and weather 
canadian wholesale prices in particular are largely determined by wholesale prices in adjacent us regions 
these prices and factors are continually monitored and provide input to operating decisions about which raw materials to buy  facilities to operate and products to make 
however  there are no reliable indicators of future market factors that accurately predict changes in margins from period to period 
imperial s downstream strategies are to provide customers with quality service and products at the lowest total cost offer  have the lowest unit costs among our competitors  ensure efficient and effective use of capital and capitalize on integration with the company s other businesses 
imperial owns and operates four refineries in canada  with distillation capacity of  barrels a day and lubricant manufacturing capacity of  barrels a day 
imperial s fuels marketing business includes retail operations across canada serving customers through about  esso branded retail service stations  of which about are company owned or leased  and wholesale and industrial operations through a network of primary distribution terminals  as well as a secondary distribution network 

table of contents chemical the north american petrochemical industry is cyclical 
the company s strategy for its chemical business is to reduce costs and maximize value by continuing to increase the integration of its chemical plants at sarnia and dartmouth with the refineries 
the company also benefits from its integration within exxonmobil s north american chemical businesses  enabling imperial to maintain a leadership position in its key market segments 
results of operations net income in of  million or a share on a diluted basis was the best on record  exceeding the previous record achieved in of  million or a share 
earnings increased primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas commodity prices 
improved upstream realizations were partially offset by the negative impacts of lower upstream volumes  higher royalties  higher energy and maintenance costs and lower overall downstream margins 
upstream net income was  million versus  million in earnings benefited from higher overall crude oil and natural gas commodity prices totaling about  million 
their positive impact on earnings was partially offset by lower conventional volumes from expected reservoir decline of about million  lower syncrude volumes of about million and lower cyclical cold lake heavy oil production of about million 
earnings were also negatively impacted by higher royalties of about million  higher energy  syncrude maintenance  and other production costs totaling about million  the absence of favourable effects of tax rate changes of about million and lower gains from asset divestments of about million 
financial statistics millions of dollars net income operating revenues world crude oil prices ended in much lower than the record levels reached earlier in the year 
the price of brent crude oil  a common benchmark of world oil markets  declined from a high of us a barrel in july to a low of us in december 
for the year  the average price of brent crude oil was us a barrel  up about percent from the company s realizations on sales of canadian conventional crude oil mirrored the same trends as world prices  ending at a level much lower than the average of the year 
prices for canadian heavy oil  including the company s heavy oil at cold lake  moved generally in line with that of the lighter crude oil 
the price of bow river  a benchmark for canadian heavy oil  increased by about percent in from and fell much below the year s average by the end of the year 
prices for canadian natural gas in were higher than in the previous year 
the average of day spot prices for natural gas in alberta was about a thousand cubic feet in  compared with in

lower production was due to the cyclic nature of production at cold lake 
gross production of synthetic crude oil from the syncrude oil sands operation  in which the company has a percent interest  was  barrels a day versus  barrels in 
lower volumes were primarily the result of planned and unplanned maintenance activities during the year  including work to improve reliability performance 
imperial s share of average gross production decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
gross production of conventional oil decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in  as a result of natural decline in western canadian reservoirs 
gross production of natural gas decreased to million cubic feet a day from million in million 
the most significant reason for the lower production volumes was the completion of production  as expected  from the wizard lake gas cap blowdown 

table of contents gross production of natural gas liquids ngls available for sale averaged  barrels a day in  down from  barrels in  mainly due to the completion of production from wizard lake

gross production is the company s share of production excluding purchases before deducting the share of mineral owners or governments or both 
net production excludes those shares 
diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to cold lake heavy oil to facilitate transportation to market by pipeline 
production of natural gas includes amounts used for internal consumption with the exception of the amounts reinjected 
production costs increased mainly due to higher energy prices and syncrude maintenance costs 
downstream net income was million  compared with million in earnings decreased primarily due to lower overall downstream margins and unfavourable inventory effects totaling about million 
earnings were also lower due to higher planned maintenance costs of about million and lower sales volumes of about million 
these factors were partially offset by a gain of million from the sale of the company s equity investment in rainbow pipe line co

effective january   these purchases sales were recorded on a net basis 
volumes a day are calculated by dividing total volumes for the year by the number of days in the year 
crude oil and feedstocks sent directly to atmospheric distillation units 
industry refining margins were lower in  compared with those in  reflecting weakening demand and higher inventory levels 
marketing margins in were higher than those in refinery throughput was percent of capacity in  one percent higher than the previous year percent 
reliability improvements through the year were partially offset by the impact of declining economic conditions that did not support running the refineries to full capacity 
downstream s total sales volumes  excluding those resulting from purchases sales contracts with the same counterparty  were  barrels a day  down from  barrels in 
lower industry demand was the main reason for the decline 
manufacturing costs in were higher than the previous year primarily reflecting higher energy prices and planned maintenance costs 
chemical net income was million  compared with million in higher margins for polyethylene products were essentially offset by lower margins for intermediate products and lower sales volumes for both polyethylene and intermediate products 
financial statistics millions of dollars net income operating revenues sales thousands of tonnes a day polymers and basic chemicals intermediate and others total petrochemicals calculated by dividing total volumes for the year by the number of days in the year 
the average industry price of polyethylene was  a tonne in  up percent from  a tonne in  contributing to higher margins for polyethylene products 
sales of chemical products were  tonnes a day  down from  tonnes in  tonnes  primarily due to lower industry demand for both polyethylene and intermediate chemical products 
manufacturing costs for were higher than  reflecting higher energy prices 
corporate and other net income effects from corporate and other were million  versus negative million last year 
favourable earnings effects were primarily due to lower share based compensation charges and the absence of unfavourable effects of tax rate changes reported in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash millions of dollars cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year although the company issues long term debt from time to time and maintains a revolving commercial paper program  internally generated funds normally cover the majority of its financial requirements 
the management of cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the company s immediate needs is carefully controlled to ensure that it is secure and readily available to meet the company s cash requirements and to optimize returns on cash balances 
cash flows from operating activities are highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices and product margins 
in addition  to support cash flows in future periods  the company will need to continually find and develop new fields  and continue to develop and apply new technologies to existing fields  in order to maintain or increase production 
projects are in place or underway to increase production capacity 
however  these volume increases are subject to a variety of risks  including project execution  operational outages  reservoir performance and regulatory changes 
the company s financial strength enables it to make large  long term capital expenditures 
imperial s portfolio of development opportunities and the complementary nature of its business segments help mitigate the overall risks of the company and associated cash flow 
further  due to its financial strength  debt capacity and portfolio of opportunities  the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the company s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for its operations and fixed commitments 
the company s registered pension plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation that is required at least once every three years 
the next such valuation will take place in given the recent downturn in financial markets  the next valuation could require that imperial increase its contributions to the plan over the next five years 
the size of any required contribution will not be known until the valuation is completed 
the company expects that it will meet any funding requirements without affecting current or future investment plans 
cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was  million  versus  million in  million 
higher cash flow in was primarily due to higher net income 
cash flow from investing activities cash used in investing activities totaled million in  compared with million in million 
higher spending on property  plant and equipment contributed to the increase 
capital and exploration expenditures total capital and exploration expenditures were  million in  compared with million in  million 
the funds were used mainly to advance the kearl oil sands project  maintain cold lake production capacity  invest in environmental initiatives and upgrade the network of esso retail outlets 
about million was spent on projects related to reducing the environmental impact of the company s operations and improving safety 
the following table shows the company s capital and exploration expenditures for upstream during the five years ending december  millions of dollars heavy oil and oil sands production exploration total capital and exploration expenditures for the upstream segment  over percent of the capital and exploration expenditures in were focused on growth opportunities 
significant expenditures during the year were for advancing the kearl oil sands project and ongoing development drilling at cold lake 
other investments included facilities improvements at syncrude  drilling at horn river and conventional fields in western canada and a d seismic program in the beaufort sea 

table of contents kearl is an oil sands mining project located northeast of fort mcmurray  alberta 
regulatory approvals were received and the project is planned to advance in phases 
production from the first phase of kearl is expected to average approximately  barrels of bitumen a day before royalties  of which imperial s share would be about  barrels 
imperial s share of proven reserves developed by the first phase is million barrels and was added to the company s proven mined bitumen reserves in about million had been invested in kearl by the end of activities in focused on engineering work to define the project design and execution plan 
other activities in also included access road construction  site preparation and earthworks 
significant progress has also been made in transportation system agreements 
imperial has acquired exploration licenses to about  net acres in british columbia s natural gas prone horn river area 
exploration drilling and evaluation commenced in planned capital and exploration expenditures in the upstream segment are expected to be about billion in  with over percent of the total focused on growth opportunities 
investments are mainly planned for the kearl oil sands project and development drilling at cold lake 
other investments will include facilities improvements at syncrude  development drilling at conventional oil and gas operations in western canada and exploration at horn river 
the following table shows the company s capital expenditures in the downstream segment during the five years ending december  millions of dollars refining and supply marketing other total capital expenditures consists primarily of real estate purchases 
for the downstream segment  capital expenditures were million in  compared with million in million 
in  downstream capital expenditures focused mainly on improving air emissions  increasing refinery capacity utilization and upgrading the retail network 
capital expenditures for the downstream segment in are expected to be about million  and will be mainly directed to increasing sulphur recovery to further reduce sulphur dioxide emissions  upgrading water management systems as well as enhancing feedstock flexibility and energy efficiency 
retail projects will continue to focus on network upgrades in major urban markets 
the following table shows the company s capital expenditures for its chemical operations during the five years ending december  millions of dollars capital expenditures of the capital expenditures for the chemical segment in  the major investment was directed to upgrading water management systems  improving safety and increasing feedstock flexibility 
planned capital expenditures for chemical in is about million and will include continued investments to increase feedstock flexibility and further upgrade water management and safety systems 
total capital and exploration expenditures for the company in  which will focus mainly on growth and productivity improvements  are expected to total about billion and to be financed from internally generated funds 
cash flow from financing activities cash used in financing activities was  million in  compared with  million in  million 
in june  another month share repurchase program was implemented 
during  the company purchased million shares for  million million shares for  million  including shares purchased from exxonmobil 
since imperial initiated its first share repurchase program in  the company has purchased million shares representing about percent of the total outstanding at the start of the program with resulting distributions to shareholders of over billion 
the company declared dividends totaling cents a share in  up from cents in cents 
regular annual per share dividends paid have increased in each of the past years and  since  payments per share have grown by percent 
total debt outstanding at the end of  excluding the company s share of equity company debt  was million  compared with million at the end of  million 
debt represented two percent of the company s capital structure at the end of  unchanged from the end of percent 

table of contents debt related interest incurred in  before capitalization of interest  was million  compared with million in million 
the average effective interest rate on the company s debt was percent in  compared with percent in percent

cash flow from net income adjusted for other non cash items page f  current income tax expense page f  note and debt related interest before capitalization page f  note divided by debt related interest before capitalization 
the company s financial strength  as evidenced by the above financial ratios  represents a competitive advantage of strategic importance 
the company s sound financial position gives it the opportunity to access capital markets in the full range of market conditions and enables the company to take on large  long term capital commitments in the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value 
commitments the following table shows the company s commitments outstanding at december  it combines data from the consolidated balance sheet and from individual notes to the consolidated financial statements 
financial statement note reference payment due by period to and beyond total amount millions of dollars capitalized lease obligations note operating leases note unconditional purchase obligations note firm capital commitments pension and other post retirement obligations note  asset retirement obligations note other long term purchase agreements capital lease obligations primarily relate to the capital lease for marine services 
minimum commitments for operating leases  shown on an undiscounted basis  primarily cover office buildings  rail cars and service stations 
unconditional purchase obligations are those long term commitments that are non cancelable and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods and services 
they mainly pertain to pipeline throughput agreements 
firm capital commitments related to capital projects  shown on an undiscounted basis 
the largest commitments outstanding at year end were million associated with the company s share of exploration projects 
the amount by which the benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for pension and other post retirement plans at year end 
the payments by period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in and estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years 
asset retirement obligations represent the fair value of legal obligations associated with site restoration on the retirement of assets with determinable useful lives 
other long term purchase agreements are non cancelable  long term commitments other than unconditional purchase obligations 
they include primarily raw material supply and transportation services agreements 
unrecognized tax benefits totaling million have not been included in the company s commitments table because the company does not expect there will be any cash impact from the final settlements as sufficient funds have been deposited with the canada revenue agency 
further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in note to the financial statements on page f the company was contingently liable at december   for a maximum of million relating to guarantees for purchasing operating equipment and other assets from its rural marketing associates upon expiry of the associate agreement or the resignation of the associate 
the company expects that the fair value of the operating equipment and other assets so purchased would cover the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees 

table of contents litigation and other contingencies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f  a variety of claims have been made against imperial oil limited and its subsidiaries 
based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  the company does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuits against the company will have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
the alberta government enacted changes to the oil and gas and generic oil sands royalty regime effective the impacts of the changes have been incorporated in the company s oil and gas reserves and mined bitumen reserves calculation  where appropriate 
in november  imperial  along with the other syncrude joint venture owners  signed an agreement with the government of alberta to amend the existing syncrude crown agreement 
under the amended agreement  beginning january   syncrude will begin transitioning to the new oil sands royalty regime by paying additional royalties  the exact amount of which will depend on production levels from to also  beginning january   syncrude s royalty will be based on bitumen value with upgrading costs and revenues excluded from the calculation 
the impacts of the amended agreement have been incorporated in the synthetic crude oil reserves calculation 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include estimates that reflect management s best judgment 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model 
imperial does not use financing structures for the purpose of altering accounting outcomes or removing debt from the balance sheet 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and the estimates that are made by the company to apply those policies 
it should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements on page f hydrocarbon reserves proved oil  gas  synthetic crude oil and mined bitumen reserve quantities are used as the basis for calculating unit of production depreciation rates and for evaluating impairment 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and deposits under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volumes  the mining plan  historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors  installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits 
estimates of mined bitumen reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volumes  the mining plan  demonstrated extraction recovery factors  planned operating capacity and operating approval limits 
the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the company through long standing approval guidelines 
reserve changes are made within a well established  disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals assisted by a central reserves group with significant technical experience  culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company s board of directors 
notably  the company does not use reserve targets to determine compensation 
key features of the estimation include rigorous peer reviewed technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance information and a requirement that management make significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves prior to reporting as proved 
although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced  the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors  including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and significant changes in long term oil and gas price levels 
the year end oil and gas reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the proved reserves tables are calculated using december prices and costs 
these reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit of production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flow 
we understand that the use of december prices and costs is intended to provide a point in time measure to calculate reserves and to enhance comparability between companies 
however  the use of year end prices for reserves estimation introduces short term price volatility into the process  which is inconsistent with the long term nature of the upstream business  since annual adjustments are required based on prices occurring on a single day 
as a result  the use of prices from a single date is not relevant to the investment decisions made by the company 
revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or revaluation of already available geologic  reservoir or production data  new geologic  reservoir or production data  or changes in year end prices and costs that are used in the determination of reserves 
this category can also include significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment facility capacity 
the quantities shown in the revisions category under heavy oil proved reserves in on page were due mainly to the changes in year end prices and costs that were used in the determination of reserves 
million barrels of mined bitumen reserves were added in  reflecting the company s share of reserves being developed in the first phase of the kearl oil sands project 

table of contents the company uses the successful efforts method to account for its exploration and production activities 
under this method  costs are accumulated on a field by field basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred 
costs of productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the unit of production method 
the company uses this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of the company s exploration and production activities 
impact of reserves on depreciation the calculation of unit of production depreciation is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of upstream assets 
it is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves those reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods applied to the asset cost 
the volumes produced and asset cost are known and  while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
while the revisions the company has made in the past are an indicator of variability  they have had little impact on the unit of production rates of depreciation 
impact of reserves and prices on testing for impairment proved oil and gas properties held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  impairment analyses are based on proved reserves 
where probable reserves exist  an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation 
an asset would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value 
impairments are measured by the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
the company performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of its asset management program 
these analyses monitor the performance of assets against corporate objectives 
they also assist the company in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable 
in addition to estimating oil and gas reserve volumes in conducting these analyses  it is also necessary to estimate future oil and gas prices 
trigger events for impairment evaluations include a significant decrease in current and projected prices or reserve volumes  an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected and historical and current operating losses 
in general  the company does not view temporarily low oil prices as a triggering event for conducting impairment tests 
the markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility 
although prices will occasionally drop significantly  the relative growth decline in supply versus demand will determine industry prices over the long term  and these cannot be accurately predicted 
accordingly  any impairment tests that the company performs make use of the company s price assumptions developed in the annual planning and budgeting process for crude oil and natural gas markets  petroleum products and chemicals 
these are the same price assumptions that are used for capital investment decisions 
volumes are based on individual field production profiles  which are also updated annually 
the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows on page is based on the year end price applied for all future years  as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
future prices used for any impairment tests will vary from the one used in the sfas disclosure and could be lower or higher for any given year 
pension benefits the company s pension plan is managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meets funding levels as determined by independent third party actuaries 
pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding  among others  the discount rate for the benefit obligations  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the long term rate of future compensation increases 
all pension assumptions are reviewed annually by senior management 
these assumptions are adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets of percent used in compares to actual returns of percent and percent achieved over the last and year periods ending december  if different assumptions are used  the expense and obligations could increase or decrease as a result 
the company s potential exposure to changes in assumptions is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f at imperial  differences between actual returns on plan assets and the long term expected returns are not recorded in pension expense in the year the differences occur 
such differences are deferred  along with other actuarial gains and losses  and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees 
pension expense represented less than one percent of total expenses in asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities legal obligations associated with site restoration on the retirement of assets with determinable useful lives are recognized when they are incurred  which is typically at the time the assets are installed 
the obligations are initially 
table of contents measured at fair value and discounted to present value 
over time  the discounted asset retirement obligation amount will be accreted for the change in its present value  with this effect included in operating expense 
as payments to settle the obligations occur on an ongoing basis and will continue over the lives of the operating assets  which can exceed years  the discount rate will be adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
for  the obligations were discounted at six percent and the accretion expense was million  before tax  which was significantly less than one percent of total expenses in the year 
there would be no material impact on the company s reported financial results if a different discount rate had been used 
asset retirement obligations are not recognized for assets with an indeterminate useful life 
asset retirement obligations for these facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are permanently shut down and dismantled 
these obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil remediation 
however  these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations  and as such  the fair value of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured  since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations 
for these and non operating assets  the company accrues provisions for environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities are based on engineering estimated costs  taking into account the anticipated method and extent of remediation consistent with legal requirements  current technology and the possible use of the location 
since these estimates are specific to the locations involved  there are many individual assumptions underlying the company s total asset retirement obligations and provision for other environmental liabilities 
while these individual assumptions can be subject to change  none of them is individually significant to the company s reported financial results 
tax contingencies the operations of the company are complex  and related tax interpretations  regulations and legislation are continually changing 
significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict 
gaap requires recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns 
the benefit of an uncertain tax position can only be recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities 
for a position that is likely to be sustained  the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized 
a reserve is established for the difference between a position taken in an income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements 
the company s unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
the company is exposed to a variety of financial  operating and market risks in the course of its business 
some of these risks are within the company s control  while others are not 
for those risks that can be controlled  specific risk management strategies are employed to reduce the likelihood of loss 
during  credit markets tightened  and the global economy slowed 
in  the company does not expect to be dependent on credit markets to fund normal operations or investment plans 
in april  the government of canada announced its intent to introduce a set of regulations to limit emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollutants from major industrial facilities in canada  although the details of the regulations have not been finalized 
consequently  attempts to assess the impact on the company are premature 
the company will continue to monitor the development of legal requirements in this area 
in the province of alberta  regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from large industrial facilities came into effect july  compliance costs were not material in and  and the company does not expect ongoing compliance costs to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
the us energy independence and security act of precludes agencies of the us federal government from procuring motive fuels from non conventional petroleum sources that have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions greater than equivalent conventional fuel 
this may have implications for the company s marketing in the united states of some heavy oil and oil sands production  but the impact cannot be determined at this time 
other risks  such as changes in international commodity prices and currency exchange rates  are beyond the company s control 
the company does not use derivative markets to speculate on the future direction of currency or commodity prices
